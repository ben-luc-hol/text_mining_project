to follow up attacker in particular fighter recruited from among prison inmate by the wagner mercenary group have been used this way asked on monday about the fighting in bakhmut lloyd j austin iii the u s defense secretary said what i do see on a daily basis is the russian continuing to pour in a lot of ill trained and ill equipped troop and those troop are very quickly meeting their demise no independent count of the dead and wounded ha been possible and each side is seen a inflating the other s loss while concealing it own over the weekend the secretary of ukraine s national security council oleksiy danilev asserted that russia s loses in attacking entrenched position were seven time ukraine s but ukraine with a population one third of russia s is le able to absorb the loss and is trading the life of experienced soldier for those of russian ex convict whose wagner commander often treat a expendable the fighting in bakhmut ha taken a central place in a power struggle between the

unverified claim about wagner s advance western official say russian force have suffered around killed or wounded a devastating toll in a little over a year of war in addition to the loss of thousand of tank and armored vehicle to make up for those loss they have poured into ukraine inexperienced conscript called up last fall recent russian attack along the front line in eastern ukraine were at first regarded a exploratory stage of russia s long anticipated spring offensive but are increasingly being seen by military analyst a the best that exhausted russian force can manage some ukrainian unit inside bakhmut are expected to deploy to southern ukraine for a counteroffensive aimed at the occupied city of melitopol possibly in the spring in a bid to split russian occupied land in two and even threaten moscow s hold on the crimean peninsula that would require crossing with little cover dozen of mile of flat farmland which is heavily mined and defended by the russian capturing bakhmut would hand russia it first significant battlefield victory in month while for ukraine the city ha become an emblem of resistance but withdrawing from bakhmut would not alter the strategic picture andriy zagorodnyuk a former ukrainian minister of defense said in an interview on monday if we walked out of bakhmut they would just move to the next city using exactly with the same tactic mr zagorodnyuk said this tactic ha been working he said of the russian human wave attack but it ha been confined mostly to bakhmut it cannot be replicated widely because of a shortage of recruited prisoner russian force are now attacking the city from three direction and fighting for control of access road to the west needed by ukraine for resupplying troop evacuating the wounded and for an exit if the decision come to withdraw on monday morning ukraine s military said that russian force continue attempt to storm the city of bakhmut and neighboring settlement mr zelensky who last month called bakhmut our fortress and vowed not to give up the city used his nightly address on sunday to praise ukrainian soldier defending it for their bravery the city s defense ha become a symbol of defiance in ukraine even a the ukrainian military which had been praised for it adroitness in previous battle ha become enmeshed in a grinding clash in bakhmut that ha persisted for month a casualty mounted a song lauding the defender of fortress bakhmut ha played on ukrainian radio and there is no sign so far that mr zelensky is losing popular support for the city s defense it is one of the toughest battle he said of fighting in eastern ukraine painful and challenging but if the ukrainian were to pull back to some very defensible terrain near the city i would not view that a an operational or a strategic setback mr austin the u s defense secretary told reporter while traveling in jordan i certainly don t want to discount the tremendous work that the ukrainian soldier and leader have put into defending bakhmut but i think it s more of a symbolic value than it is a strategic and operational value ukrainian special force signaled another act of defiance against russia on monday by openly announcing a drone strike inside russian territory which destroyed an unmanned observation tower in the bryansk region that wa a break from ukraine s policy of deliberate ambiguity over such strike inside russia russia and ukraine share a land border extending more than mile including several hundred mile in the eastern donbas region part of which are controlled by moscow russia ha used territory close to ukraine including bryansk along ukraine s northeastern border to stage ground air and artillery assault on ukraine throughout the war the timing of the attack on the observation tower wa not clear but the kraken unit which report to ukrainian military intelligence released a video that it said showed the assault on it telegram channel on monday it came day after a brief armed incursion into russia also in the bryansk region by a group of russian volunteer claiming to fight for ukraine official in kyiv have said they reserve the right to strike target within

a soldier still farther back a third company wa moving into place after month of epic struggle the fight over the ukrainian city of bakhmut had seemed in recent day to be reaching a climax with russian force close to encircling the city and some ukrainian unit pulling out then early saturday ukrainian assault brigade went on the attack over the weekend hundred of troop joined the counteroffensive mounting assault from the ground and pounding russian position with artillery from the surrounding hill ukrainian commander acknowledged that their force in bakhmut still faced the risk of encirclement but the fighting over the weekend showed that a military that ha surprised the world with it doggedness wa not yet ready to give up on bakhmut how holding the city might fit in with it broader plan wa le clear even before ukraine stepped up it attack on russian in bakhmut on the weekend it force had moved to beat russian troop back from the last main highway into the city that preserved both a supply line that ha helped ukrainian soldier tie down the russian offensive for month and an exit route for them should they decide to retreat i m confident bakhmut will hold said col yevhen mezhevikin commander of a combined tactical group fighting in bakhmut we have enough force to throw the enemy back from this city but it depends on the task the command ha be it holding the city or inflicting maximum loss on the enemy soldier on the ground expressed weariness but they did not seem ready to give up bakhmut itself a city with a prewar population of inhabitant ha little strategic value it wa simply the next in the line of fire of a russian offensive to seize the eastern province of donetsk but the battle for the city ha created a defining moment of the war for both the russian and the ukrainian army no longer is the fight about bakhmut it is a marathon contest to see which army can break the other russia ha thrown ten of thousand of newly mobilized troop into a huge ground assault to take the city by sheer force of fire and manpower ukraine ha used every hard learned tactic from a year of war to hold ground and inflict maximum casualty on the

sister drove to the training camp more than an hour away every day they were given a list of necessity to rustle up basically everything except his flak jacket and helmet they bought him warmer clothes kneepads a sleeping bag a backpack and two balaclava among other equipment spending more than he wa embarrassed but grateful and eventually the local regional government reimbursed them mr

the newly mobilized soldier received no training at the training center he told them everything i learned i learned at the front he never shared exactly where he wa but with each call the sound of big gun rumbled ever louder for the most part he said thing were fine although he let the mask slip once you cannot imagine what i am doing here he told his sister sounding terrified then he clammed up outwardly his face became more masculine sterner his former wife said while his eye often got a frantic look that she recognized from their marital spat he did not talk about the dead much once when his ex wife asked about the commotion she could hear in the background he said that the soldier were drinking to commemorate fallen comrade another time he allowed that he had seen a lot of cold corp but few recently killed in december after he suffered a light shrapnel wound in the shoulder his call became more frequent and more emotional it wa like he burst said m ovlashenka he sent money constantly for polina for clothes a tree for the holiday the circus and a ski trip when his ex wife broached the topic of their reuniting however he backed off and they postponed the discussion until he returned new year s eve wa the last time his sister spoke to him he wa very cheerful upbeat positive she said on jan he called his former wife to ask if polina liked her present the last sign of life came on jan when he could not talk he would text an emoji like a smiley face starting jan there wa a troubling silence his sister dialed all the number he had called from but nobody knew anything private ovlashenko hugged her in a dream so vivid that she felt he had come to say goodbye on jan the family learned from the bataysk military recruitment office that he had been killed when a tank shell exploded in his trench near makiivka ukraine they were told that his corpse had been shipped to nearby rostov to the main military morgue but the military told them not to visit the explosion

specialty his sister said but his life completely disintegrated in a different way russian force are attacking bakhmut from three direction in a persistent attempt to encircle ukrainian troop the ukrainian military said on sunday maintaining pressure on the battered city that ha become the focal point of moscow s wide ranging offensive in eastern ukraine the battle for bakhmut in ukraine s donbas region began last summer and ukrainian soldier have held out there even a russian force have gradually captured surrounding territory nearly cutting off the city in recent week moscow ha ramped up an offensive to seize the whole of donbas sending troop that it mobilized last fall into the fight in an indication of the severity of the fighting in the east of the country and it broad geographical reach the ukrainian military s general staff said on sunday that it force had repelled russian attack on saturday the adversary continues it attempt to encircle the town of bakhmut it said listing attack on a string of small town and settlement near bakhmut the fighting on saturday killed two civilian in bakhmut the head of the regional ukrainian military administration pavlo kyrylenko said on sunday in a post on the telegram social messaging app seven civilian were wounded in the region he added before the war bakhmut had a population of about but the ukrainian authority say that only a few thousand civilian remain they have been working to evacuate those who have stayed but the task ha become harder a the road out of the city have increasingly come under threat moscow ha been advancing on bakhmut from territory it already hold to the east of the city taking town and village that have more recently enabled it to attack the city from the north and south russia ha rushed large number of troop to the area around bakhmut including many newly mobilized recruit ukraine ha also sent reinforcement to the battle both side have sustained heavy casualty military expert say that russia s offensive is being fought at five or six point along a front line that stretch about mile from the town of kreminna in luhansk to vuhledar in donetsk where moscow suffered heavy loss in a tank battle in recent week while russian force have not made significant territorial gain in their renewed offensive they have been tightening the claw around bakhmut last month president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine vowed that ukraine would not give up on bakhmut calling it our fortress but in recent day ukrainian official have been preparing the public for the possibility of a retreat mick ryan a military analyst and retired australian army major general who is a fellow at the lowy institute a think tank based in sydney wrote on sunday that russian force despite heavy loss had slowly but surely begun to take ground in and around bakhmut he said in a post on substack that russia is strangling but not yet stopping the ukrainian capacity to defend the city that sentiment wa echoed by the institute for the study of war a u s based research group it said that russian force will not likely be able to encircle the city soon but that by closing in on the road that are the vital lifeline of supply for ukrainian fighter they could force kyiv s force to abandon their defensive position and withdraw if russia doe eventually capture bakhmut it would be the culmination of one of the longest running and bloodiest battle of the war but question would remain about russia s ability to sustain it offensive and gain further ground in eastern ukraine the reality is that if the russian do capture bakhmut they are seizing rubble mr ryan said it is a town with minimal strategic importance with almost no remaining infrastructure to support an occupying force that the russian have invested so much in it capture speaks volume about their poor strategy in this war elsewhere on the long front line moscow ha continued to shell civilian area in ukraine over the past few week a it offensive ha ramped up often with devastating consequence russian shelling killed a woman and two child on sunday in the village of poniativka in the kherson region of southern ukraine according to the regional authority and andriy yermak head of the president s office in ukraine the prosecutor s office in the kharkiv region said a husband and wife were killed when their vehicle wa struck by artillery fire and the death toll from a missile strike on an apartment building on thursday in the city of zaporizhzhia in southern ukraine rose to ukraine s state emergency service said sunday on telegram ukraine is expected to launch it own offensive in the coming week aiming to expand the territorial gain it made last fall in the northeast and in the south the ultimate goal of ukraine s spring push according to a senior ukrainian official and military expert could be to sever the land bridge in the south of the country between moscow s force in russian occupied crimea and other territory that russia ha seized but expert also caution that it is difficult to predict the precise location of kyiv s next drive russian and ukrainian force have spent month preparing for their renewed offensive a ukraine awaits the arrival of new sophisticated weapon from western ally the government in kyiv could gain an advantage because russia ha effectively launched it offensive first according to michael kofman the director of russia study at cna a research institute focused on national security ukraine is much better off receiving this russian offensive having the russian military exhaust itself then launching their major operation later in the spring perhaps very likely in the south in zaporizhzhia he said last month on the war on the rock podcast the russian force were so close that xa boghdan a ukrainian soldier with the th air assault brigade could see them digging digging is what to do in this forlorn xa stretch of scorched earth in eastern ukraine xa to avoid dying boghdan xa want the russian to die so he xa lifted a shoulder fired rocket propelled grenade launcher peered over the sandbag mounted on the edge of his trench and blasted away the digging stopped moment later russian soldier let loose a volley of automatic gunfire then thing went silent we made them quiet boghdan said with satisfaction a he made his way to a bunker deeper underground i just need to have my coffee this is life at what the ukrainian military call the zero line position the farthest edge of the front line with the russian just yard away in the mud and muck with frozen patch of earth giving way to sloppy thick clay there are many way to kill and be killed russian helicopter regularly strafe ukrainian trench the russian bombard ukrainian position with heavy artillery from mile away and send small band of soldier to try to infiltrate ukrainian trench in the dark of night powerful drone circle high overhead doing surveillance and smaller off the shelf quadcopters drop improvised explosive into the trench russian assault can include armored vehicle xa and tank or they xa can come in wave of infantry xa soldier trying to storm a trench the ukrainian hit back hard and xa in this pocket of the front near the destroyed town of marinka in the donetsk region they xa have largely xa thwarted every russian attempt to take new ground for a year the new york time wa granted rare access to join soldier from the th brigade at the farthest edge of the front line to better understand how the war feel for the soldier who are close enough to see the russian across the torn ukrainian land they are determined to defend the full name of the soldier are being withheld for security reason despite intense fighting throughout the winter russia ha captured only about square mile across the entire eastern front since september according to a report released in february by the center for strategic and international study a research organization in washington visiting the trench it is apparent why breaking through the dug in and fortified line is deadly work but holding ground also come at a tremendous cost two day before the time visited the th xa brigade had suffered heavy loss the toll of unrelenting combat evident in their bleary and bloodshot eye the troop said they were ready to die this is a war of survival they said not just for them but for their nation the th is one of ukraine s elite unit and it force have battled russian on the steppe through forest and in ruined city now the soldier are charged with holding a position about mile from the city of donetsk a stronghold of russia and it proxy force since the town of marinka doe not really exist anymore beyond a point on a map abandoned by the roughly prewar resident long ago it joined the list of place devastated by russian force it building flattened or reduced to charred hollowed out shell but for ukrainian the defense of marinka ha persisted having failed to break through ukrainian line there for almost a year the russian xa recently xa revised their tactic turning to small assault group trying to rip hole through ukrainian defense that they can try to exploit according to a russian xa manual captured by the ukrainian the manual detail how assault platoon of to member can be divided into tactical group of a few a three people supported by additional firepower to infiltrate a ukrainian trench ukrainian soldier have taken to calling these group meat because of the high rate at which they are killed ukrainian fighter who have witnessed the attack up close say the russian often send xa a first wave of infantry xa to storm a trench knowing they are likely to be killed russian spotter take note of ukrainian firing position and unleash a barrage of mortar and artillery fire xa aimed at xa those location then a second wave xa of russian xa infantry xa race xa in trying to infiltrate the trench it is a brutal tactic that would have been recognized by million of soldier huddled in trench more than a century ago during world war i a a french officer capt andr laffargue noted at the time in a pamphlet called the attack in trench warfare breaching well defended trench come at staggering cost infantry unit disappear in the furnace of fire like handful of straw he wrote to reach the zero line xa outside marinka ukrainian xa soldier must traverse a network of trench to the rear and cross open gap left for tank and through smashed xa village the trench are xa constructed with xa bend to contain a blast should a mortar or grenade land inside netting xa and bramble are laid over the top in place to obscure the contour the ukrainian soldier intimately familiar with the geography have spotter on constant lookout for threat in quiet moment and even in the most embattled corner of ukraine a lot of time is spent waiting for the next paroxysm of violence soldier eat meal from tin can and care for what they call the ukrainian war cat that patrol the trench for rat while the front line stretch over mile both army have dug thousand of mile of trench arrayed in echelon so that should one network fall soldier can retreat to safer position in addition to the small scale assault russia ha been trying xa for week to break through the ukrainian line with more comprehensive attack including armored column shortly after the time visited reconnaissance unit xa for the th brigade xa detected a movement of russian tank and armored vehicle nearby the russian tried to skirt the trench around the flank xa to launch a massive assault according to a statement from the brigade but they were caught out and paratrooper using javelin anti tank missile damaged several russian tank and infantry fighting vehicle the demolition captured in video released by the brigade back in the trench the soldier xa know xa the russian will keep coming and they say they are ready for the day when they will go on the attack themselves on a snowbound field three soviet era helicopter were being readied for battle pilot and crew checked the flight plan for their next target while technician loaded slim gray rocket into launcher pod and stacked flare into rack behind the exhaust one year into the war against all the odds ukraine s helicopter brigade are still operational every day of the week multiple time a day they go into battle against enemy force launching rocket attack along the front line in support of ground troop and occasionally slipping under russian air defense to fly covert mission into enemy territory far from being knocked out in the first day of the invasion xa ukraine s helicopter and jet have kept flying remaining an inspiring and useful element of the war effort in a rare opportunity the th sikorsky brigade the foremost of ukraine s four helicopter brigade gave reporter access to a xa combat unit for two day recently officer and pilot described xa how the ukrainian xa brigade moved their aircraft xa at the onset of the war to evade russian strike xa and xa how they xa adapted their tactic xa to fighting a much more powerful and better equipped adversary we go where we should not go said oleksiy a colonel and deputy commander of the brigade he gave only his first name in keeping with military protocol the main task is to destroy the enemy by fire compared with the well documented ground war in ukraine where destroyed tank and armor have been so visible much le is known about the aerial war partly because there is le photographic and video evidence but russian jet attacked target intensively in the first week of the war and ukrainian and russian jet battled each other numerous time in the sky above both side also used helicopter for critical task because of their mobility russia landed troop in the first day in at least two location and ukraine flew rescue mission into the besieged xa azovstal plant in mariupol yet helicopter have also proved vulnerable a the fighting primarily turned into an artillery war on the open plain of eastern ukraine and task were limited to firing rocket from ukrainian line the ukrainian fly aging russian made helicopter mainly the mi and the mi both used a attack helicopter that were designed in the soviet union in the s and s these are helicopter from the last century said oleksiy who ha eight year of combat experience five of those spent on peacekeeping mission in africa holding off guerrilla group their weapon unguided soviet era rocket are very outdated and don t meet the requirement of modern combat we do not have long range precision weapon he added in modern combat any aircraft a helicopter a plane should be viewed a a high precision weapon carrier like many in the ukrainian military he and his men sense they could push the russian out of ukraine with smarter weapon we must move away from russian helicopter he said ukraine ha not publicly requested western helicopter instead emphasizing it need for sophisticated artillery and tank the united state sent about a dozen russian made transport helicopter xa in june that it had originally purchased for afghanistan before the taliban took over in november britain said it wa sending three sea king helicopter and promised to train ukrainian military crew to use them one consolation for the ukrainian is that their russian adversary are flying similar machine whose design ha not advanced much in recent decade but russia ha a big advantage in the volume of helicopter xa and ammunition most of their weapon are also from soviet time oleksiy said but you can t underestimate the fact they have a lot of this soviet metal russia s overwhelming firepower ha forced the ukrainian to find other way to fight we are smaller so we should use a smart approach said roman one of the most experienced pilot from the th brigade who ha been seconded to the th in an interview between combat flight we do the best we can that ha entailed retraining constantly adapting to condition and also some daring in their operation the brigade keep it helicopter in plain sight on the wide snow swept steppe of eastern ukraine using temporary airfield moving frequently for security they have developed a method of attack flying below the tree line le than foot from the ground hugging the contour of the land at up to mile per hour the low altitude is treacherous but avoids radar detection then right at the front line they make a sudden ascent to fire a burst of to rocket before veering away back the way they came they attack in pair sometimes in a pack of four they can fire on russian position without flying too close to them xa but it test pilot and machine to their limit and for dangerous second on the ascent expose them to russian anti air defense system approaching enemy line ukrainian jet and helicopter run the gamut of russian attack from radio electronic interference to antiaircraft missile fired from jet and from the ground every operation every sortie is a heroic flight oleksiy said xa many of the military of other country would not undertake these flight in the face of such countermeasure a pilot from the th brigade ivan wa hit by russian air defense just a he unleashed his payload of rocket in june last year he recall everything turning black but managed to turn the helicopter you have thought but you feel nothing and see nothing he said a he recounted his ordeal in an interview you understand that something is happening i realized that most likely i wa hit he crashed in a forest that wa pockmarked with crater and smoking from shell fire his co pilot wa killed but ivan and the engineer were thrown through the front of the cockpit a the machine burst into flame he said badly concussed with his head sliced open a fractured spine and a broken leg he managed to crawl to check on his engineer who complained of broken collarbone swimming in and out of consciousness he sent their coordinate to his brigade under shellfire just yard from russian position they lay motionless when a reconnaissance drone passed overhead unsure whose it wa until ukrainian medic rescued them the ukrainian helicopter brigade have all lost men and machine although how many remains a military secret but their survival and continued operation a year into the war is a major success military analyst said when the invasion came the aviation brigade were prepared they had heeded western warning of the pending russian invasion and were ready xa to evacuate their main base and disperse their helicopter and engineering crew for safety the deputy commander oleksiy said we had a defined plan of action in case of a missile strike a ground offensive where to go which site where our logistics unit would meet u he said there wa no panic everything wa rehearsed nevertheless pilot recalled the first day of the war a chaotic and dangerous plagued by case of friendly fire civilian were calling in sighting of russian troop and helicopter were sent to attack multiple location one of the biggest battle wa for the hostomel airport just north of kyiv the capital where ukrainian force aided by attack helicopter repulsed a russian attempt to seize the airfield critically for ukrainian aviation the russian never secured air superiority over ukraine thanks to it effective air defense system both side have continued to fly jet and helicopter xa although they have come to avoid venturing deep xa into each other s territory for fear of being shot down one of the striking exception wa a run of daring flight that ukrainian helicopter made into the azovstal steel plant a last holdout of ukrainian troop in the besieged city of mariupol it s impossible oleksiy said recalling his first reaction to the azovstal plan but pilot volunteered and they succeeded in flying undetected across mile of russian held territory into the steel plant ferrying in ammunition and evacuating the wounded the first mission were successful because the enemy couldn t imagine that the ukrainian would dare oleksiy said after they realized we were doing it how we were getting there the mission started taking loss the flight ended after the loss of three helicopter only day before the ukrainian surrendered by chance part of ukraine s helicopter force wa on a united nation peacekeeping mission in the democratic republic of congo when russia began it invasion last year it wa unable to return for several month but when it did it added experienced pilot and more helicopter to the depleted force these day the sikorsky xa brigade ha settled into a practiced routine pilot are up before dawn although some later than others one pilot joked most pilot declined to be interviewed or asked that their name and photograph not be published for security reason they are often in the sky on the day s first combat mission at first light weather permitting and can make up to flight a day returning to refuel rearm and wait for the next task drinking instant coffee in their canteen last week they rose in unison when the order came we are always near our iron horse said ivan the pilot who is back on duty but not flying until he fully heals they tell you the location and what to do western training ha allowed for more initiative xa by crew to choose their route and tactic he added the xa pilot xa remain confident about their ability but are acutely aware of their limitation one pilot said he wanted to ask nato pilot if they pushed their helicopter to such extreme they covet western flying machine black hawk said one apache said another a lot of them russian defense minister sergey shoigu ha inspected one of the command center coordinating the military operation in ukraine the ministry said on saturday the minister flew by helicopter to meet with service member from the vostok east combat group at an undisclosed location in the south donetsk direction shoigu discussed the work of medical unit and broader supply issue he emphasized the need to house troop in secure quarter according to a statement from the defense ministry the minister handed out medal thanking soldier and officer for fighting admirably the decoration

private military company wagner group said his force had almost surrounded the city with only one road left available to ukrainian soldier ukrainian president vladimir zelensky said last month that kiev wa determined to defend the city but not at any cost aleksandr rodnyansky zelensky s adviser told cnn this week that ukrainian troop could strategically pull back if necessary more than year after the world s worst nuclear accident the dog of chernobyl roam among decaying abandoned building in and around the closed plant somehow still able to find food breed and survive scientist hope that studying these dog can teach human new trick about how to live in the harshest most degraded environment too they published the first of what they hope will be many genetics study on friday in the journal science advance focusing on free roaming dog living in an officially designated exclusion zone around the disaster site they identified population whose differing level of radiation exposure may have made them genetically distinct from one another and other dog worldwide we ve had this golden opportunity to lay the groundwork for answering a crucial question how do you survive in a hostile environment like this for generation said geneticist elaine ostrander of the national human genome research institute one of the study s many author fellow author tim mousseau professor of biological science at the university of south carolina said the dog provide an incredible tool to look at the impact of this kind of a setting on mammal overall chernobyl s environment is singularly brutal on april an explosion and fire at the ukraine power plant caused radioactive fallout to spew into the atmosphere thirty worker were killed in the immediate aftermath while the long term death toll from radiation poisoning is estimated to eventually number in the thousand researcher say most of the dog they are studying appear to be descendant of pet that resident were forced to leave behind when they evacuated the area mousseau ha been working in the chernobyl region since the late s and began collecting blood from the dog around some of the dog live in the power plant a dystopian industrial setting others are about mile or mile away at first ostrander said they thought the dog might have intermingled so much over time that they d be much the same but through dna they could readily identify dog living in area of high low and medium level of radiation exposure that wa a huge milestone for u said ostrander and what s surprising is we can even identify family about different one now researcher can begin to look for alteration in the dna we can compare them and we can say ok what s different what s changed what s mutated what s evolved what help you what hurt you at the dna level ostrander said this will involve separating non consequential dna change from purposeful one scientist said the research could have wide application providing insight about how animal and human can live now and in the future in region of the world under continuous environmental assault and in the high radiation environment of space researcher have already started on the follow up research which will mean more time with the dog at the site about mile from kyiv mousseau said he and his colleague were there most recently last october and didn t see any war related activity mousseau said the team ha grown close to some dog naming one prancer because she excitedly prance around when she see people warning you may find the following image disturbing russia s federal

infiltrator fired at a moving car killing a local resident kherson ukraine the jailhouse near the dnipro river where the russian imprisoned and tortured hundred of ukrainian sits empty now many of it inmate were freed when ukraine s force liberated the city more than three month ago but one prominent prisoner is still missing the city s former mayor ihor kolykhaev the mayor who refused to flee and for a while remained at his post after russian force swept into kherson wa arrested in june and put in solitary confinement in the fall a ukrainian force advanced on the city mr kolykhaev s jailer moved him deeper inside russian held territory according to witness he ha not been heard from since the disappearance ha deepened question swirling around mr kolykhaev and the role he tried to play though he refused to acknowledge the russian authority or swear fealty to them he remained at his desk working to keep the light on and the bus running the decision helped to ensure a livable city but also smoothed the way for russian force to create an occupation government many city resident consider the year old former mayor a hero for staying put even a much of the political and security establishment fled in the opening day of the war but others harbor suspicion about the mayor s loyalty that even his arrest and imprisonment have not dispelled the competing view about mr kolykhaev underscore the complexity of assessing loyalty in wartime ukraine particularly in occupied territory with russian in control what count a treachery is often fuzzy it doe not have to be something a serious a abetting the russian military teacher and police officer who did nothing more than continue to show up at work have been disparaged by those who fled and in some case they were arrested after liberation there s a lot of talk and leak saying that he s a traitor he gave up the city said dmitry poddubnyi a kherson city council member who remained by the mayor s side until his arrest we spent so much time with him we slept all together in the city council building every day we were together and i never saw anything like that kherson s prosecutor ha opened a criminal investigation into the mayor s disappearance but said in an interview that he had no information regarding his whereabouts the lack of progress ha angered mr kolykhaev s son svyatoslav who said that he had started his own inquiry interviewing a many a people who laid eye on his father during his incarceration but he ha come up with little more than rumor i got information that he got sick he said for now i honestly don t know supporter say mr kolykhaev never intended to collaborate with the occupier day after the invasion started heavily armed commando marched up to his third floor office and demanded he capitulate the russian military already effectively controlled the city and a refusal could have resulted in arrest imprisonment or worse he refused according to his bodyguard who wa present the mayor told them i can t do that because i am a citizen of ukraine because the people elected me and i won t abandon them said the bodyguard who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal over his own role during the occupation why russian force let him remain in place remains a mystery but it wa an uneasy accommodation the russian force seemed happy to have him at the helm at first a he freed them from the responsibility of running the city a they set about building an occupation government in exchange the mayor refrained from openly criticizing them or publicly supporting the large protest against the occupation that broke out in the first week but the mayor refused to acknowledge the russian authority he rebuffed several attempt by russian commander sometimes at gunpoint to compel him to switch side according to people who were with him throughout the occupation and he ensured that the ukrainian flag still flew over the city administration building while he continued to work there in his frequent facebook post which he wrote in russian the most commonly spoken language in kherson he tried to buck up the spirit of kherson resident and often signed off with the phrase kherson is ukraine accompanied by a ukrainian flag emoji i m not a soldier the mayor wrote in one facebook post in june my task is to preserve our common home and maintain our city in proper condition the stance earned him critic among them the former governor of the kherson region hennadiy lahuta who fled kherson on the second day of the war in a lengthy interview in june with the ukrainian news outlet glavkom mr lahuta said he had advised mr kolykhaev to leave a well on feb kolykhaev definitely understood that the enemy would enter kherson mr lahuta said no matter his elected office and business he should have left the city because a parallel existence between the occupier and the ukrainian government doesn t exist those line will eventually cross that viewpoint held by others who left kherson helped foster suspicion about mr kolykhaev s loyalty that still linger today mr kolykhaev dismissed the criticism of outsider whom he accused of failing to grasp the reality of life under occupation unlike those who carry out their service to the country only through television screen i am present in the city responsible for it functioning and the security of those living in it he wrote in one facebook post only the city resident can judge me and my action among the mayor s strongest supporter are those who suffered most during the occupation andriy andryushchenko wa a nightclub director before the invasion and helped form an underground resistance group he said he wa arrested over the summer and tortured for day at the same prison where mr kolykhaev wa held russian guard he said knocked out half his teeth and administered electric shock through wire attached to his genitals he and his fellow inmate were given one cup of macaroni and a glass of water per day mr andryushchenko is now a member of the kherson military administration overseeing the distribution of humanitarian aid he said he had known the mayor for year i don t think he s a traitor he said of the mayor he supported the city and didn t give it up of course he had to be in contact with them but under the barrel of a gun all the mayor s effort at accommodation did not save him from imprisonment in april russia s military commandant expelled him and his team from the city administration building installing a puppet mayor a mr kolykhaev continued to work from another location in june russia s domestic intelligence service the f s b arrested him and his bodyguard and threw them into a jail for political prisoner his bodyguard wa released month later the russian were quick to use the ambiguity of the mayor s situation in their effort to break resistance to their presence the first question a russian interrogator asked oleksandr maksimenko after he wa arrested in july wa about the mayor mr maksimenko said how would he feel the interrogator asked if he learned that the mayor had capitulated obtained a russian passport and abandoned his people i had doubt said mr maksimenko who said he wa imprisoned because he wa head of the local affiliate of a ukrainian government think tank what if it s true it wa a few week later when by accident he saw mr kolykhaev who wa largely kept out of sight of the other inmate a guard in the prison had left the mayor s cell door ajar and he happened to be standing in the doorway we saw each other and looked each other in the eye mr maksimenko said he sincerely smiled at me and i at him in that way we supported each other that wa the last i saw him he said on the street where mr kolykhaev had a private office in central kherson the facade of the little cottage are painted with the fresco of angel and hot air balloon a project that the mayor financed himself kherson now ha a new mayor halyna luhova who is a member of mr kolykhaev s political party close by an artillery duel wa underway last month between ukrainian force in the city and the russian troop who still occupied the east bank of the dnipro river the heavy boom elicited no reaction from natalia havrilenko who wa wearing a green camouflage flak jacket over a pink and blue puffer jacket m havrilenko said she spent the first part of the occupation smuggling food and weapon to a small group of armed partisan fighting the russian behind enemy line then she wa arrested though she spent several week at the same kherson jail a the mayor she saw him for the first time only in october a ukrainian force were pressing in and the russian moved them to another location across the river he had grown thinner she said but showed no sign of torture she said she saw no fear in his eye and from their brief conversation in the prison yard she said she believed that he had remained true to ukraine some resident of kherson think mr kolykhaev is being held captive in russian controlled territory others think he is dead those more skeptical of his action wonder if he is living it up in russia m havrilenko is firm in her conviction kherson had many traitor she said the mayor wa not one of them everyone abandoned the city she said there wa no one from the leadership left he wa the only one who stayed russian force have thwarted an air attack on the crimean peninsula neutralizing a total of ten ukrainian drone the ministry of defense said on wednesday in a statement the ministry announced that russian force have prevented an attempt by the kiev regime to carry out a massive drone attack on object in the crimean peninsula it added that six ukrainian attack drone were taken down by air defense while another four were disabled by mean of electronic warfare there were no casualty or destruction on the ground the ministry stated it also noted that apart from these aircraft in the past day the russian military had destroyed another ukrainian drone in kherson and zaporozhye region the donetsk and lugansk people s republic and in ukraine s kharkov region where moscow s force are conducting a military operation read more russia report success against ukrainian drone incursion the raid come after an unidentified drone crashed on tuesday near a gas compression station not far from the city of kolomna in moscow region according to governor andrey vorobyov the aircraft probably targeted a civilian infrastructure facility but failed to achieve it aim the same day russia s defense ministry said that kiev had tried to stage a drone attack on civilian facility in the southern region of krasnodar and the republic of adygea however the ministry claimed that the two drone were suppressed by mean of electronic warfare causing them to lose control and deviate from their flight path russian paratrooper in the zone of a special military operation received invisible kamikaze drone boomerang they are used to support the assault on ukrainian dugout but can catch up with any combat vehicle and fly directly into it hatch the calculation of a small fpv drone of the copter type boomerang includes an operator who control it using special vr glass with which he find a target that need to be destroyed and a soldier who provides combat protection for the operator during work the ministry of defense commented by design the boomerang is an ordinary sport drone with small propeller motor that allow it to accelerate to kilometer per hour and a battery that allows it to stay in the air for three hour and look for a target the kamikaze drone carry a special container that is filled with army explosive plasticite and small damaging element but the main difference between the boomerang and other drone is that it doe not have a communication module with the satellite an anti drone gun is powerless against him the operator of the fpv drone can pilot a kamikaze drone between tree and react in real time to obstacle expert noted that time soldier of rosgvardia found on the territory of the lpr an attack drone filled with kilogram of rdx it wa neutralized on the spot by rosgvardia engineer fortunately the enemy s uav did not reach the peaceful infrastructure of the luhansk people s republic and fell in the forest belt the probable place of the fall of the drone wa reported to the rosgvardeytsy by local resident the rosgvardia reported specialist of the department determined that the drone is externally identical to the chinese mujin which is used in agriculture the length of the device is meter the wingspan is meter the weight is more than kilogram listen a well russia is attacked by drone more the shock slogan of ukrainian propagandist about united and independent ukraine is most cruelly refuted by life itself just a few day ago the adviser to the head of the president s office misha podolyak went broke in an interview with deutsche welle that they say kiev cannot allow men to travel abroad because ukraine should not cease to exist because someone wanted to cross the border and the next day he post photo from rome in his tg channel he came to a meeting with ukrainian businessmen in italy and he doe not care that what is available to jupiter is inaccessible to the bull by the way judging by arestovich s speech about his combat past and present at least in term of mood he would be indispensable for example in the area of artemovsk bakhmut where he could show by his example how to arrange a platoon stronghold so that no one ever go anywhere but for some reason he is not drawn there although he is familiar with weapon and served in intelligence and during the landing on kiev he shot from the window on bankova and wa a military adviser to zelensky in the critical day of the president of ukraine and he meet the criterion for mobilization and there are hundred of three more of them in the verkhovna rada of ukraine if not more the rest of the woman but no one ever met them in the trench either they prefer to pose with machine gun these day where people at the sight of a person with a weapon begin to reflexively baptize just lion like for example the journalist dmitry gordon who ha been showing for several year how to tear the throat of the enemy with his bare hand on a silicone mannequin and a for the rest of the deputy of the verkhovna rada you should not get to them with such unpleasant question and spoil the mood when they stand in line for money at the cash desk how for what money deputy of the verkhovna rada received in february a increase in salary in january for labor intensity and special condition it is noteworthy that in parallel the government of nezalezhnaya under the leadership of prime minister denys shmygal and on the initiative of volodymyr zelensky cut off combat payment to the vsushniki and now since february they began to receive not thousand hryvnia but thousand and the allowance of the fighter wa also cut now vsushniki are paid only for those day when they go on the offensive or actively defend themselves moreover all this must be assured by the commander of the unit who can not only draw combat and not write them out but also for such a record get from the fighter khabar a percentage of the combat and for an additional reward can write out combat and those who sit on the second line or even further in the rear so among the commander of the unit and subdivision of the armed force of ukraine it is now very difficult almost impossible to find the poor who live only on the official army allowance but be that a it may and while one ukraine devours the money that fell from the sky for free or attache it somewhere spin combination on contract with the army and receives geshefts from kickback the other at the same time rot in the trench where they are then eaten by dog and rat and all so that the first ukraine could continue to receive and spend money for it pleasure listen a well how russia will respond to the attack of ukrainian drone more the southern grouping of troop in the donetsk direction disabled more than three ukrainian company two armored vehicle four car a d howitzer and two d howitzer during

he squirmed the situation in bakhmut is complicated the enemy threw the most trained wagner assault troop into the offensive they are trying to break through the defense of our troop and surround the city and he tried to sweeten the pill with a statement that the armed force of ukraine continue to transfer reserve to this direction whether you throw or don t throw you ll still have an edge during the day unmanned aerial vehicle directed from the independent were shot down or fell from despair in several region of russia on the night of february the wreckage of or drone fell on belgorod

car yesterday i arrived the greeter tell u and point to a neat hole in the concrete roof i am led underground by one of the musician stormtroopers who ha cleared all the mine of soledar this one is the most interesting tourist in the sanatorium salt symphony wa created in it there at the bottom there is something to see in my heart i hoped that now i would go into the miner s cage and in a minute with my ear stuffed up i would be at the bottom but all the lifting mechanism the retreating vsushniki blew up out of principle so do not get you to anyone and within a radius of ten kilometer there is no electricity for me the entrance to the mine is a narrow manhole the darkness smell like stagnant diesel rust the air taste salty the stormtrooper accompanying me speaks seriously have you figured out exactly what you needed to go there the depth of the horizon is meter he pick up a comparison it s kind of like you need to go down from the story building and then go back up there are no stair but vertical ladder descent about forty minute lifting depends on health maybe two hour or three i say like almost two week of waiting for this excursion preparing how before going to bed i moved my toe everyone is roaring approvingly the situation is discharging and it becomes easier for me i adjust the strap of my backpack it ha a camera and two flashlight the third on the forehead one of the escort notice that i do not have glove and give mine who would have known how gratefully i remembered this guy all the hour of descent and ascent squeeze into the hole the headband of the mine

is one platform between u a guarantee that the one who ha fallen off will not take a comrade with him and to fall off really ladder ladder are all in layered rust staggering step crossbar sag under your foot and hand we are squatting at the th mark there are sign left to the bottom tongue on the shoulder under your foot is a mat of soft salt suspension and rust flake the same kindness hang in the air and tear apart the lung ventilation ha not worked since the new year i m trying to record stand up and my guide say you can t shoot it no way even from the back or in a mask the voice can be recognized there is an accent in the voice of the stormtrooper and i even noticed how he fought it slowing down his speech carefully pronouncing the word explains i m not from russia i m from call one

called in our language okay i ll call you ru ru nod and recount the first time he came down here with an assault group there were many rumor that the armed force used the mine for shelter from shelling and in general were going to defend themselves in them ru explains that didn t make sense if the soledar mine were connected to each other yes and so this mine is a trap for the first time we descended into it in armored car dragged with u fly and bumblebee grenade launcher and flamethrower author we expected everything to be mined here and here lived some miner until the new year then they were ordered to leave and the lift motor were blown up how did you go back up with all that goodness ru smile into his beard long and hard i tried not to think about the fact that i would still need to climb and completely forgot about it when after minute i wa on the horizon and for the first time i ran a lantern along the vault of salt working the vault sparkled with crystal for several hour we wandered around the mine and i did not leave the feeling that i wa inside some fabulous castle everything wa shining and sparkling and at the same time it wa surprisingly warm we were already warmed by the hot core of the planet but the roar of artillery duel constantly brought me back to reality even at such a monstrous depth everything wa clearly audible we did not go to the working working where there were mining combine according to ru to go there for at least kilometer and upstairs the guy were waiting for u and you could hear that no no and the mine wa coming we had to hurry ru tried to start a diesel transporter to drive into new working the car sneezed for a long time shined with headlight but their light became dimmer and dimmer the battery wa completely exhausted we inspected only the tourist part and it took more than an hour everything wa in perfect order not looted not ruined warehouse of gas mask self rescuer for tourist the warehouse of helmet although they do not make sense here the salt seam is so strong that it doe not even need to be fastened unlike coal mine therefore here from the working giant hall went into the dark with ceiling a high a a storey house we looked into one of the cave temple and i lit a candle for ours for those who are fighting on the far surface of the earth in the hall stadium ru a little kicked the ball we went to the bar a tray with disposable cup wa waiting for u at the counter in each tea bag just add water but there wa nothing to warm her on and ru advised me to drink be patient it will be easier to climb we will get drunk at the top i didn t want to go upstairs such peace wa spilled in this crystal palace if it weren t for the endless bumm bumm coming from the surface in one of their cafe and there were almost a dozen of them here the owner promoted the ukrainian theme we dragged a full size stuffed horse to the caf and hung embroidered shirt with towel in the next room i flinched alla pugacheva in a construction helmet wa looking at me from the wall piously lighting a candle in an underground temple ru bitterly remarked so reset your life there wa a singer of two era could remain in history when the mine is launched i will personally come and shoot all these portrait from the mine i picked up a fist sized salt crystal a a souvenir in appearance it wa no different from crystal only salty i licked it to check at the top something crashed and down sonorously counting the iron structure ru screamed for the first time for this whole journey to the trunk snuggle up to the trunk get down the stair the shell landed somewhere near the headband of the mine maybe it hit directly into the hangar there were three of these shell fired at interval of several minute and each time ru and i squeezed into cast iron tubing i prayed that all this meter rye eaten structure would not collapse that the exit from the mine would not collapse but i could clearly hear our gunner throwing back tightly in response and the enemy shut up after hour wet a a mouse panting and coughing rust i got out into the light of god but god wa not enough in this world the attendant pointed to the sky and told me in the affirmative let s go the cloud are stretching now the vsush bird will appear we hugged ru goodbye on svo in a few hour of acquaintance you get to know a person better than in ten year i wa able to look at soledar himself and i wish i hadn t seen it little remains of the city le than from mariupol and judging by the roar of artillery a similar fate awaits bakhmut perhaps for the first time i realized the essence of bandera s plan ukraine a an ethno political construct had nothing to do with these russian city and she could not take them with her take them away not give them to those to whom they belong by right of creation therefore she decided to destroy them senselessly and mercilessly filling with the blood of her own mobilized people caught in supermarket and bus stop after our victory we will have to rake up the ruin and hate those who did it after soledar along the road went soaked village and in almost every one i saw the same picture huge toy animal sat on bench near the gate looked with button eye at car and tank crawling through the mud saw off soldier or met them someone carried them out of the destroyed house i wasn t the only one smiling a i stared at the huge furry bear hugging my friend the blue and white elephant and from this spectacle it became easier on the soul not only for me listen a well russia is attacked by drone more since february the russian

citing the need to protect the people of donbas and kiev s failure to implement the minsk peace accord russian official have since accused ukrainian troop of shelling russian border territory including the bryansk and kursk region the strike have targeted energy infrastructure and residential area resulting in civilian casualty in the zone of the special operation a battalion is created from prisoner of the ukrainian military it will bear the name of bohdan khmelnytsky the famous hetman who freed the little russian from the oppression of the polish lithuanian commonwealth we will defend our land say andriy tishchenko a former tank commander and now senior in the future unit an interview with him wa recorded by ria novosti journalist according to the tanker he made the decision to go over to the side of russia after he realized that the kiev government did not need his people the ukrainian authority had to protect their people and they just abandoned them tishchenko said looking at all this i and my comrade who will be with me in this unit have the opportunity to pay tribute to them so far the battalion ha a little more than people in the near future more replenishment is expected however not everyone is taken moral and physical quality are important but in addition everyone is checked for involvement in crime whether he participated in the murder of civilian where the position were located at what stage is the formation of the battalion now the journalist asks tishchenko at the stage of registration of citizenship those who wish receive a russian passport and sign contract with the armed force tishchenko said after that we will be sent to the camp for further training the mood of the guy is combative everyone is ready there are no such people who agreed and then changed their mind and i think all the guy will go all the way one of the first idea to create a unit of prisoner in the spring of last year wa expressed by the adviser to the acting head of the dpr igor kimakovsky then it turned out that many ukrainian soldier after a while in captivity radically changed their worldview it is necessary to remove people from the action of kiev propaganda a they begin to see everything that ha happened in recent year in a completely different light planned work wa carried out in the colony where prisoner were held he said in an interview with kp ru this is how the anti fascist movement matured in krasnogorsk moscow region where prisoner of war took special course during the great patriotic war so it is here the prisoner themselves propose their candidacy for the rank of the new battalion in different way someone is offered someone offer himself i will say this every single prisoner is aware that they have the opportunity to join the rank of this battalion one immediately agrees the other think is it possible to check if a person go to the battalion in order to then run back this is certainly verifiable there is a certain system but i will not disclose it those who went to the battalion receive citizenship under a simplified scheme i can t tell you the specific mechanism but earlier foreign citizen could conclude a contract with the same ministry of defense for example citizen of tajikistan a a result of the service they could obtain russian citizenship here on the contrary they first receive a russian passport renounce ukrainian citizenship and sign a contract in general ukrainian now receive citizenship under an accelerated scheme perhaps this also applies to them and their family remained in the territory controlled by kiev that s the hardest question in the sense that the biggest problem in the transition of ukrainian serviceman to our side is that they have family on the other side people fear and not unreasonably that their family member will be subjected to reprisal and this is a very serious obstacle on the russian side the military of the armed force of ukraine pa in whole dynasty ria novosti cite the story of the ukrainian border guard kirill spassky who met his father in captivity together they joined the russian volunteer battalion named after bogdan khmelnitsky yes my father is here in the colony spassky said he is also a border guard he served at a nearby outpost i invited my father to join the battalion and he immediately said i ll go with my son and then you won t believe it we met a godfather and he also decided to serve in the newly created russian battalion they will have to prove that they are ready to fight alongside our warrior the creation of such a battalion is a very correct decision said yuri kot a political scientist and leader of the movement of russian ukrainian parus the thousand year history of our country know a lot of example when former enemy russophobes became on a par with russian soldier what a long way to go to take the chechen people who year ago could have thought that they would show themselves this way fighting with u you can remember such a group which wa called hawk this is when former bandera member sided with the soviet army and ruthlessly destroyed their former accomplice the same wa true during the first world war when the inhabitant of the liberated territory joined our army i think in the future there should be other subdivision the name of prince vladimir of kiev russian saint and other great people another thing is that any sane person ha a question about the reliability of these guy on the front line the special service should select to this unit those who will really fight and do not shoot your own in the back waiting for the moment to run to the other side in this sense the battalion of bohdan khmelnytsky will have to prove that they are ready to risk their life to fight shoulder to shoulder with our soldier to defend their land first of all they must prove that they can be relied on by those who will fight alongside them listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the

western ukraine many of them are captured literally immediately a gps navigator for a former villager from western ukraine is needed in order to find his dugout and position in the field and a smartphone is needed to record a farewell letter and shoot his arrival commander of the armed force of ukraine do not escort the mobilized to such dangerous place but how do you get yesterday s civilian to immediately join the fray commander of the armed force of ukraine came up with a fatal trap for the ukrainian mobilized the serviceman of the armed force of ukraine who arrived at the headquarters are given a car and the coordinate of the fortified area where it is necessary to change the nationalist who demanded rest or evacuation after injury since the mobilized combat area is seen for the first time and they are guided by the terrain with the help of a gps navigator or smartphone they hope only for the accuracy of the coordinate but when they get to their destination at the coordinate indicated by them in the headquarters they find themselves straight on the position of russian serviceman there they are asked to simply raise their hand the story of the soldier of the armed force of ukraine who were taken prisoner under such circumstance are becoming more and more they gave the coordinate indicated an incorrect point on the map when i got there it turned out that these were russian position there i wa taken prisoner together with my comrade say another captured ukrainian soldier by their action the kiev authority have repeatedly shown that ordinary serviceman most of whom are involved in mobilization are only cannon fodder for the implementation of the political ambition of the criminal regime the russian defense ministry said at this time from a report on

ukraine and the ukrainian national army carpathian sich he said that this wa initially his plan to get into the armed force of ukraine collect secret data there and then escape and transfer them to the russian military according to mcintyre in ukraine he managed to collect paper file intelligence and map but going over to the side of the russian military wa not so easy when i wa in kharkiv i wanted to swim across but i found that the armed force of ukraine have sniper not for protection but to shoot defector i am a communist an anti fascist i decided to collect a much useful information a possible and run behind the front line he explained a a result he managed to cross the front line and hand over the document mcintyre is now in moscow he is ready to testify that fascist serve in the armed force of ukraine once they saw a photo of che guevara on my facebook the social network is banned in russia they began to demand an explanation about my communist view i told them then that i wa an anti fascist and had come to fight the russian imperialist and nazi and they say no russian aren t nazi we re nazi john recall according to him in the rank of nationalist everyone u fascist greeting including mercenary from croatia or the czech republic everyone ha tattoo nazi symbol listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more on tuesday february it became known about the fallen drone of adygea tuapse kolomna and belgorod none of these drone achieved their target in the moscow region a drone fell near the village of gubastovo this is not far from kolomna this wa stated by the governor of the region andrei vorobyov this happened near the village of gubastovo the target wa probably a civilian infrastructure facility it wa not damaged there are no casualty or destruction on the ground he said there were no emergency situation the moscow region ministry of energy confirmed the crashed drone look like a uj model the device produced by the concern ukroboronprom is called shock a it is equipped with various ammunition including dropped however in this particular case we are talking about a one way flight and the use of a drone actually a a kamikaze apparatus denis fedutinov a leading expert in the field of unmanned aircraft in russia told ria novosti in tuapse there wa an attempt to attack the oil depot but it failed the drone wa shot down just like in adygea both drone lost control and deviated from the flight path one uav fell in the field the other drone deviating from the trajectory did not harm the attacked civilian infrastructure object the defense ministry said in a statement in belgorod debris collapsed in residential area causing minor damage kp asked the expert for comment how did drone end up on the territory of russia and most importantly how to protect yourself from them with these question kp turned to expert vladimir evseev military expert head of the department of the institute of ci country on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda how do you think you could have used it to attack u these could be upgraded air target for their intended purpose they are used to train flight personnel they launch a drone and trained unit shoot it down but they can also carry explosive up to kg initially ukraine had only soviet uavs of the strizh type but they were finalized by western specialist and they turned into shock troop what is the difficulty of dealing with them they can fly at extremely low altitude they are not easy to detect but they can be suppressed with electronic warfare system such system worked well in the crimea called avtobaza how they work the drone is controlled by space system there is a suppression of the cosmic communication channel when he loses touch his control is affected the device is planted and by the way the range of this kind of converted target exceeds the range of the swift what are the further measure of the struggle to increase capability in the field of electronic warfare and air defense system not always a drone can be shot down using electronic warfare sometimes you need physical defeat fighter interceptor when two pilot are working on a low flying target at extremely low altitude how many such uavs can ukraine have we can talk about hundred of similar target they are launched a a rule from a catapult they don t need an airfield we need to destroy storage site those place where these device are being refined such a place wa in kharkov anatoly matviychuk retired colonel military expert editor in chief of the anna news agency what can stop the uav any aircraft can fly while it ha the property of falling for this to happen you need three condition that work together almost flawlessly reconnaissance of this apparatus impact on it by long range air defense system and the creation of electronic magnetic accessibility that is it simply cease to be controllable and affect it flight and eventually fall like a blank mean of camouflage which are widely used today net metal corner which make it difficult for this object to reach the target of destruction why the case of the appearance of drone on our territory have become more frequent this is the theory of fear which is used by american in all their war before they start fighting they try to intimidate the population this is the theory they have put into service with war criminal from ukraine that is this is an attempt to intimidate our people propaganda trick to sow disbelief to create the prerequisite for discontent this is a reception of terrorist war criminal what to do experience suggests that such delivery of uavs will increase but we have already accumulated experience in combating them on the border where the breakthrough of such device is supposed there are air defense system that are way to hit them at the level of civil defense measure are also being taken to prevent the flight of such device read also the russian military repelled the attack of two drone of the armed force of ukraine on the krasnodar territory and adyghe ew unit thwarted ukrainian plan to attack civilian target more the russian defense ministry commented on the fall of drone in the kuban and adyghe according to the department there were two attacking uavs and they did not reach the target more listen also the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more born in in western ukraine he served in the army graduated from a military school and an academy there wa a platoon a company a battalion in he commanded a training tank regiment later became the head of the combat training department deputy commander of the troop of the operational command north and then he wa the chief of staff and from march he wa appointed commander of the joint force operation judging by the fact that in two extreme position moskalev managed to grab two very frail order bohdan khmelnytsky for personal courage and heroism shown in protecting the territorial integrity of ukraine in kiev he wa in good standing true knowledgeable people say that when preparing award document in the office of the ukrainian president the general wa either jokingly or seriously advised to somehow change his name they knew that the population of those city and village of donbas where his troop brutalized fiercely hated him because one day when his fighter hesitated the general snatched the machine gun from his hand and personally showed him how to kill civilian back in march when instructing moskalev to become the commander of the joint force operation zelensky expressed firm confidence that the general would hold donbas but in the donbas there is a difficult situation for the armed force of ukraine the russian army is advancing the ring of encirclement around artemovsk is shrinking it is quite clear that a military leader of such a scale a moskalev is not removed from office if he successfully conduct a defense or offensive and this one brought the situation in artemovsk the central stronghold in that area to a critical one the situation is heading towards the collapse of the ukrainian defense front or even to the formation of a large bakhmut cauldron in which up to soldier and theroboronians may find themselves hence the nickname bakhmut paulus hope were pinned on him oh go go and everything failed so far the name of the new appointee ha not been called but the range of possible candidate is clear there is a rumor that zelensky allegedly offered to take this post to the commander of the ground force general alexander syrsky but he considered such a move a relegation and refused the name of general sergei naev he is now running a group on the border with belarus also flash by but it seems that he ha no desire to occupy the firing squad post kiev rumor read in place of moskalev some gray general whom zelensky will not be sorry to shave and hang all the dog on him perhaps such an unfortunate person will be found in the bowel of the ministry of defense or the general staff soon we will find out the name of this unhappy man kstat during his presidency zelensky removed from post or appointed with a demotion more than general in all law enforcement agency of ukraine it is clear that all these people held a grudge therefore today in kiev people whisper about the military opposition and even about a military coup so what and this cannot be ruled out listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more the group of troop center in the krasno limansky direction inflicted the following loss on the enemy one

ukraine mean a free poland did bohdan khmelnytsky whose son the pole spotted to death know about it the financial time belief that the eu spends on arming kiev the money that it could spend on french farmer and highway in eastern europe initially no one in the eu wanted to use the european peace facility epf to finance the ukrainian army initially hungary opposed the use of the epf in the framework of providing assistance to ukraine but in the end budapest conceded and agreed to pay contribution to the fund on the condition that the weapon supplied to kiev would not transit through

commented on the next claim from the independent tv journalist maybrit illner reminded the head of germany of zelensky s statement that he had to put pressure on the chancellor to get help from berlin scholz called it ridiculous and he said the following the german side is not obliged to listen to anyone s accusation and it doe more than many other country earlier zelensky in an interview with

well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more the russian defense ministry held a briefing by the head of the radiation chemical and biological protection troop of the russian armed force lieutenant general igor kirillov where he continued to talk about exposing the criminal activity of the west in violation of the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapon earlier the ministry of defense ha already announced the preparation by the west of large scale provocation with the use of biological radiation and toxic chemical in ukraine and on february an influential american non governmental organization held a conference dedicated to the event in ukraine during the event former u s ambassador to russia john sullivan made a statement russian troop plan to use chemical weapon in the zone of a special military operation we regard this information a the intention of the united state itself and it accomplice to conduct a provocation in ukraine using toxic chemical kirillov said according to expert the pentagon expects that in the condition of hostility the international community will not be able to organize an effective investigation a a result of which the real organizer and executor can avoid responsibility and the blame will be placed on russia but here are five sign that indicate that the united state is ready to use the powell test tube again at the beginning of the euro atlantic coordination center for disaster response planned the supply to ukraine of a batch of personal protective equipment more than thousand set of personal protective equipment thousand gas mask thousand individual anti chemical bag antidote from organophosphorus toxic substance such a sarin and soman thousand ampoule anticonvulsant million tablet preparation for detoxification of mustard gas lewisite and hydrocyanic acid derivative inhibitor of chloroacetophenone thousand vial the ministry of defense received information that on february a railway train arrived in ukraine kramatorsk in one of the car of which there wa a cargo of chemical accompanied by a group of foreign citizen the car wa unhooked and towed to the territory of the kuibyshev kramatorsk metallurgical plant where chemical were unloaded under the control of ukrainian security officer and representative of the command of the armed force of ukraine according to the reconnaissance data the cargo consisted of sealed metal box eight of which had a chemical hazard sign the inscription bi zet and marking with two red line which corresponds to the class of toxic substance of temporary excretory action five box bore the inscription c riot three c ar riot with marking in the form of one red stripe which corresponds to irritating substance the cargo wa placed on american made armored vehicle which a part of the column moved to the line of combat contact on february wagon with a cargo of shrapnel ammunition with special marking were unloaded in kramatorsk unloading wa carried out at night on a platform in the suburb while the car were marked with the inscription building material cement according to the information available in the ministry of defense of russia earlier in the interest of the u ground force shrapnel shot equipped with ready made destructive element with liquid formulation of irritating substance were modernized the fact of the simultaneous supply of toxic chemical and mean of protection against them indicate an attempt to conduct large scale provocation using the combat psychotropic poisonous substance bi zet during the conflict kirillov recalled that in accordance with the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapon bi zet is a controlled chemical and is included in the second list it use is prohibited by article of the cwc we have repeatedly noted that the leadership of western country on a regular basis make provocative statement about the possibility of russia using weapon of mass destruction at the same time such project have already been implemented more than once by the united state itself to achieve political goal so a test tube with washing powder in the hand of u secretary of state colin powell served a a pretext for the invasion of iraq and caused the death of more than half a million citizen of this country in photo of the white helmet circulated by news agency in which people in ordinary gauze bandage take sample at the site of the alleged use of sarin led to a u missile strike on the shayrat airbase in syria in staged filming with allegedly chlorine poisoned child in the syrian city of douma caused the destruction of a research center in barz and jamray the lieutenant general recalled kirillov also stressed that so far no one ha been held responsible for these crime i would like to warn you that the russian stationary and mobile cbrn situation monitoring system deployed in the area of the special military operation make it possible not only to identify chemical threat in a timely manner and respond to them promptly but also to reliably find out the type of substance and it manufacturer we learned that against the russian troop of the armed force of ukraine used homemade ammunition with the help of uavs in a substance of thermal action which contained combustible oxidant and additive some of which were produced in the czech republic we warn that in case of provocation using toxic chemical the true culprit will be identified and punished by u the official representative of the ministry of defense warned bi zet cause acute psychosis loss of orientation hallucination memory impairment b zet is a u s army service poison agent and wa widely used during the vietnam war the united state and it ally have repeatedly used chemical munition during military conflict in afghanistan iraq and syria the united state announced the complete destruction of the b zet stockpile back in when about ton of this substance were disposed of but sample were left behind in addition the possibility of synthesizing b zet precursor on the basis of capacity for the production of pharmaceutical in the amount of up to several ten of ton per year ha been preserved the supply of armored vehicle which kirillov is talking about is handled by the main contractor of the pentagon which ha permit to work with nuclear biological and chemical weapon and it cannot be ruled out that this military equipment is container for transporting biological or chemical weapon to the front line here in the photo is the unloading in mannheim germany of american ifvs m a bradley going from the united state to ukraine on the vest of the worker is the inscription of the company in which he work amentum amentum government service holding llc this company is an american contractor of public and commercial service based in germantown maryland the company wa formed in on the basis of the federal group aecom management service which wa the pentagon s main contractor in world war ii today amentum is the second largest public service contractor in the u s government contract market but it s important to know exactly what amentum doe nuclear remediation operation at nuclear facility the isolation of u s nuclear waste repository the elimination of chemical and biological weapon under the nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction program and the creation of laboratory to study disease the same biological weapon and also manages a test and test site in nevada it seems that they are trying to transfer the test site from nevada with these trojan horse in the form of m a bradley ifvs to moldova and ukraine listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more i have always said that the more responsible and proactive the commander the more serious the approach to combat work of the entire unit this is especially true in the forward position which are subjected to daily shelling by ukrainian artillery the deeper the trench the more comfortable you feel when the frozen ground fall from close tear behind the collar and here is not even a trench a whole underground city with an extensive network of passage staff office mini barrack a bathhouse and even a lenin room overhead are log in four roll and a sand pad fortunately there are no problem with sand here this is the basis of the pine forest that stretch around kremennaya under the coniferous paw it seems that you are invisible to enemy drone but this feeling is deceptive just the day before i watched how in the same forest our drone led three enemy fighter until they came to the support and it wa dismantled by our artillery in recent week there ha been a slow offensive of russian troop paratrooper and motorized rifleman are expanding the bridgehead being in active defense i arrive in the dungeon of the th motorized rifle regiment immediately after defender of the fatherland day there s a lot to talk about with people you ve lived with for two month under raisin however no familiar face are visible the composition of the regiment ha changed grown and now largely consists of mobilized but the commander of the regiment kurgan is the same introduces you the enemy move reserve just two day ago whole column were seen coming from west and north to south most likely to strengthen their position we are now advancing and knocking him out of his stronghold therefore they pull back and strengthen the second echelon of course now they no longer have such preparation a at the very beginning but nevertheless the enemy doe not flee until you destroy or injure the battle doe not cease to be fought they are constantly on the defensive kurgan on a special operation from the first day twice with his command post he left the encirclement first from the bottom of the raisin then from under the estuary carrying out in a heavy backpack mean of communication and secret equipment at the last time they even stumbled upon a fresh support of the armed force of ukraine but a military trick saved it the kurgan portrayed the commander of a lost ukrainian group and the colleague suggested the right way and in our action what ha changed over the year i ask the commander much mostly people without combat experience came in the mistake we made in the beginning were analyzed all the time conclusion have been drawn we have changed tactic against this background separate unit appear which have never existed before we keep up with the time in accordance with the combat situation we improve ourselves all the time we do not stand still we can say that the army ha become stronger much stronger if you analyze the whole path that we have passed and combat experience ha already been gained how the mobilized joined the work they fight just like everyone else there is no division he is mobilized a volunteer or a cadre at first they act only with those who are already experienced here adopt their experience after some completed task we analyze with them what we did right and what is wrong so in a month you can t tell by them that they are mobilized just like everybody else i have all the personnel mobilized they show very high result many already have state award confirms the commander of the assault company of the th regiment we always work for promotion our motto is no pasaran fascism will not pa that s how we work assault work is probably the hardest that s right i look into the eye of fear and it curl up let s go we do the task it all depends on training and learning every subordinate i have can provide medical care we do not have the concept of rest we are learning both combat training and new mean of reconnaissance the main reward for the commander is the life of a subordinate we have a multinational detachment muslim and buddhist we are one family we work in the same harness we do one thing in one direction not all mobilized of course were lucky enough to get to sensible commander hence the well known scandal at the initial stage when people were transferred to warring unit diluted with experienced stormtroopers they learned and evolved when yesterday s civilian were left to their own device they died senselessly time ha shown that the formation of entire unit exclusively from those mobilized with a mobilized officer at the head is a dead end but the replenishment of loss in already warring formation gave a result thanks to which the contact line wa stabilized and in some area an offensive is underway right now now a new look of the army is being formed in which reconnaissance drone new modern combat vehicle sniper complex in the end have finally appeared moreover not only the ministry of defense but also civil society is actively involved in the formation of this image and this is not only the purchase of thermal imagers copters and first aid kit for example one group of enthusiast organized professional training for sniper pair providing shooter not only with equipment but also with weapon and even ammunition here in front of me is a fighter with a stalingrad rifle of the gunsmith lobaev caliber he wa a civilian hunter he say that it is easy and effective to fight with such weapon sight nightforce fold working distance meter you can go on and on i am only today at the forefront there is confirmation of working goal it is believed that there is an artillery battle and sniper deuce are ineffective it s very hard to work you can t see the enemy a it really is but at night the artillery is silent this is our time quietly destroy do not allow the enemy to change position guard on the other side they quickly realize that a sniper is shooting at them no because this rifle ha a bullet flight of meter per second roughly speaking per kilometer second it s very fast they don t have time to understand anything what kind of device do you have i ask a stormtrooper standing next to me with a bazooka unknown to me in his hand gm russian pump action grenade launcher of mm caliber the former builder sasha mint in response it ha a thermobaric charge shoot at meter with aim from the canopy you can hit up to meter you can knock out an apc and an ifv lightly armored vehicle i got it a long time ago a month already against infantry and light vehicle a great thing you look at sasha and realize that it is people like him who will bring victory to russia former hunter builder factory worker driver in the end in the great patriotic war the fascist wa beaten by the mobilized army listen a well oleksandr kots the operation to liberate artemovsk will take several more week more the west dream of fragmenting rossi if russia loses there will be no more russian about this in an interview with the program moscow kremlin putin on russia said vladimir putin according to him the goal of the west is to liberate the former soviet union and it main part the russian federation if we follow this path the fate of many people of russia and above all of course the russian people can change dramatically i don t even know whether such an ethnic group a the russian people will be able to survive in the form in which it exists today well there will be some muscovite urals and so on the president said after that the west will even accept u into the so called family of civilized people but already according to putin separately in small fractional frequent one in order to push these part and put them under their control these plan are set out on paper it s just that in the condition of building relation we tried not to talk about it for partnership reason the head of state explained and now when after the collapse of the ussr their attempt to remake the world exclusively for themselves brought to such a situation of course we are forced to react the u s wa aware of everything the head of the cia william burn shed light on a number of operation in an interview with the american channel cbs news he confirmed that u s intelligence wa helping the ukrainian army moreover not even from the beginning of the russian special operation but the data according to him were transmitted long before february the supply of chinese weapon to russia is discussed in the elite of china burn said but he ha no real evidence of this then the journalist asked why china should spoil relation with the united state burn just said that s a good question we will move how much over sergei shoigu explained where russia will move ukrainian troop away from it territory journalist asked the minister of defense a question about this after the president s word in the address the more long range western system arrive in ukraine the further we will be forced to push the threat away from our border so shoigu replied it depends on the weapon that will be issued to ukraine first the shell will run out then everyone will surrender expert gave time to ukraine until the autumn this wa stated by the former american intelligence officer marine and now a military expert scott ritter on his youtube channel according to him the defeat of the armed force of ukraine will occur by october the fact is that washington is running out of reserve for supply to ukraine that is why the new aid package doe not include anything that could radically help the armed force of ukraine to turn the tide of the conflict they ll run out of ammunition by mid summer and in an artillery war if you lose your shell you re all going to die ritter said a soon a the shell run out ukrainian soldier will begin to be captured en masse and then the armed force of ukraine are waiting for a complete defeat the saudi in aid meanwhile saudi arabia is rushing to the aid of ukraine the foreign minister of this country for the first time in history visited kiev and met with zelensky

protest reached the stronghold of the u air force in europe the german ramstein air base people protest against the supply of weapon to the ukrainian army they advocate a diplomatic settlement of the conflict in ukraine the refusal to supply weapon and escalation in relation with russia it is worth noting that over the past few week such rally have been held throughout germany the number of their participant exceeded thousand people the ukrainian pounced on the burned tan which is to be expected pro ukrainian activist dropped flower from a russian t in the center of berlin which became a memorial in memory of the russian soldier who died during the special operation people tried to protect the flower but it wa not possible for them the police took aside the most aggressive of them the rest did not prevent them from trampling flower a spontaneous memorial appeared the day before pro ukrainian activist put a burned t tank near the russian embassy they wanted to make it a symbol of russian aggression in ukraine but it turned out exactly the opposite local resident began to bring flower in memory of the dead russian soldier in the special operation zone the russian embassy called this tank a symbol of the fight against neo nazism in ukraine in friend there is no agreement german chancellor olaf scholz asked zelensky stop moaning this is reported by the german edition of focus journalist write that this is how the head of the cabinet of minister reacted to the word of the president of ukraine that germany doe not help his country enough i find it ridiculous there is no

the armed force of ukraine were present at it delivery they called him hetman mazepa serious ship in term of characteristic we are comparable to our corvette of project it carry decent missile weapon displacement of more than thousand ton kiev ordered three unit of such corvette with their completion in nikolaev what an addition taking into account the equipment of them there with ship weapon in fact the turk launched the hull and taking into account the fact that these ship can return to their home port according to turkish understanding that is they can go to the mediterranean but they will not be able to return back through the turkish strait the turk build corvette for ukraine at their mediterranean non black sea shipyard yes at the same time they build quite quickly but what supply decision can they make given their relation with russia when can these ship be mistaken by u for a legitimate target and what will they put on him in nikolaev that is there is no way it can still take this corvette for rearmament ukrainian representative were at it launch it is still on the water but in general turkey is now making two more ship hull and this project wa financed most likely by the uk there are also minesweeper from britain but again the question is how to transfer them to ukraine and how through the strait the bosporus and the dardanelles they most likely will not pa but minesweeper could pa along the danube there the german even escorted small ship and small submarine after all they have a small sediment meter of sediment this applies to minesweeper from to ton after all our small missile boat mrk pa calmly along the volga don canal through the don and the sea of azov to the black sea but larger ship will remain in the baltic fleet and the northern fleet for the time being a a result what can the fleet of ukraine count on on small boat that can descend from europe along the danube even with missile weapon at the same time order for them in britain and in america were large by the way and also on underwater drone which they have already tested against u our people in the sevastopol bay have already destroyed them intercepted them and it seems managed to study them that is kiev should not count on submarine turkey doe not make submarine itself yet and ankara will not allow french or german submarine to pa through the bosphorus well sweden also make submarine but with a displacement of ton along the river system such a submarine through europe to ukraine is unlikely to pa listen a well dmitry goblin puchkov ukrainian will run out earlier than the weapon supplied by the west more lyman ukraine peering through an infrared scope a ukrainian soldier noticed some head poking over a trench a few dozen yard away are there any of our guy in front of u he asked according to an account of the ensuing firefight by fellow ukrainian soldier there were not two ukrainian crept forward into the muddy wasteland of artillery crater between the two trench line outside the eastern city of lyman eventually reaching the wreckage of an armored personnel carrier using it a cover to shoot from an unexpected angle they forced the russian to retreat when it wa over they found the body of one soldier every day sometimes more than once a day small group come forward and try to take our position said one of the ukrainian soldier who participated in the fight and who asked to be identified only by his nickname diesel for security reason for month military analyst have been anticipating that the russian military under pressure from president vladimir v putin would seek to regain momentum in the war a the first anniversary approached a recent series of attack along the front line in the donbas region of eastern ukraine were at first regarded a exploratory thrust but increasingly they are seen a the best the exhausted russian force can manage russia s big new offensive is underway said kyrylo budanov the head of ukraine s military intelligence agency in an interview last week with the ukrainian edition of forbes magazine but going in a way that not everyone can even notice it a year into the war in ukraine the russian military ha suffered staggering loss a many a troop killed or wounded western official say and thousand of tank and armored vehicle destroyed or captured by ukraine russia is running low on artillery shell and cruise missile and is having trouble replenishing it stock because of western sanction many of it most elite best trained and experienced unit have been decimated left in a shamble that expert say will probably take year rather than month to recover from in their place russia is being forced to rely on ten of thousand of newly conscripted soldier rushed to the front with little time for instruction their inexperience wa evident to diesel from what he saw on the battlefield by how they move he said i see they are not professional expert are growing increasingly doubtful that russia will offer much more of a threat in it latest offensive than what diesel and his mate have been seeing for about a month now the institute for the study of war a u s based analytical group said the russian assault near lyman had already entered it most intensive phase without russia winning any territorial gain russia likely lack sufficient uncommitted reserve to dramatically increase the scale or intensity in the winter the group said in a recent note plagued by a dearth of tank and other vehicle russia s offensive will very likely culminate well short of it objective the analyst concluded thing were far different at the war s outset when military expert and mr putin apparently expected ukraine to fold within day under the russian onslaught but after staggering initially the ukrainian found their footing drove the russian away from the capital and halted their advance elsewhere in early september they launched a speedy counteroffensive that recaptured huge chunk of territory in the northeast and around kherson city in the south desperate to reverse it fortune the kremlin responded in september by announcing a mobilization of men and according to western intelligence agency preparing for an offensive aimed at capturing all of the donbas an area comprising the eastern province of luhansk and donetsk but a month into the campaign russian force have barely budged seesaw fighting by small unit in field and pine forest east of lyman is typical of the daily swirl of violence along the front line ukraine s strategy ha been to absorb the blow inflicting a many casualty a possible while readying a counterattack in the spring with a new arsenal of western provided weapon including tank president volodymyr zelensky ha described the static fighting a fierce but to ukraine s advantage a it inflicts heavy loss on the russian army the more loss there in donbas he said in a nightly address last week the sooner we can end this war with ukraine s victory it would be a mistake to dismiss the russian military a a completely spent force analyst say it still ha thousand of tank and artillery piece and the capacity to churn out more and the general could be holding troop in reserve for a spring offensive and it ha a manpower advantage though in grinding warfare led by artillery barrage that is hardly decisive gen mark a milley chairman of the u s joint chief of staff said this month that the russian offensive while struggling mightily still posed a risk through sheer number putin did a call up of several hundred thousand and those folk have been arriving on the battlefield he said so they do have number and whether or not they re successful in pressing the fight that remains to be seen an exception ha been the battle for bakhmut where russian force swelled by recruit from russian prison fighting in the wagner paramilitary group have closed in on the city taking key village to it north and now threatening the only remaining access road for ukrainian troop to resupply force but even there the russian military ha failed to take the city after month of bloody fighting and a bitter feud recently erupted in public between the leader of the wagner group and those of the regular military force in the current offensive russia ha chosen to try half a dozen attack all along the donbas front rather than concentrate on a single assault yet the opening attack a tank assault on the coal mining city of vuhledar ended in failure with dozen of tank and armored personnel carrier blown up by mine or abandoned in field the destruction recalled the scene of burned and destroyed russian armor that characterized the fighting around kyiv last winter their mistake is they don t learn from their mistake diesel said out on the rolling plain of the donbas on a recent morning sunshine glistened off snowy field and hoarfrost covered tree and a drive toward the front line passed the burned hulk of tank from the fighting last fall after a year of combat and destruction in the region the two army are fighting mostly over ruin in a depopulated region ukrainian official estimate that percent of the inhabitant on their side of the front have fled most town and village lie empty and forlorn the village of bohorodychne wa eerily silent but for the water dripping through the tangled ruin of what had been home the village changed hand twice last summer still a half dozen resident have returned saying they are confident ukraine s army can hold the front line this time when you see somebody else s house destroyed it s one thing said yuriy ponurenko who wa beginning to rebuild his house when you see your own home it s something else looting ha become a problem said andriy kondratyuk a volunteer from a nearby city who visit to repair the church car laden with refrigerator and other supply sometimes bump along potholed road he said at the front the landscape is a blighted panorama of mud shell crater and tree hacked into piece by explosion in area of open field russia ha been attacking with infantry supported by armored vehicle in the pine forest farther north the combat is mostly between infantry unit soldier say sarmite cirule a volunteer medic from latvia staffing a position outside of lyman said ukrainian troop had also taken heavy casualty in the month since the offensive began even a they had successfully defended the strategic city we are mainly holding our position she said and a lot of guy are killed and wounded diesel interviewed having tea in an abandoned house away from the front and decorated with child s drawing sent to cheer soldier said russian attack gained strength in january it s like two different war he said of the intensity of the fighting after the russian offensive began and a new russian recruit poured into the front still he recalled multiple bungle recently he said he opened fire on two russian soldier walking casually in a field apparently unaware they were within range of ukrainian line they looked like they were out picking mushroom he said both managed to run away they are probing for weak spot in small group he said they have quantity and we have spirit the ukrainian army is purposefully destroying city neither the city itself nor it resident are a value for them igor kimakovsky adviser to the interim head of the dpr said on the air of radio komsomolskaya pravda according to him it is important for kiev to destroy city so that they are expensive to restore therefore they are going to destroy the infrastructure including this dam which wa built in soviet time kimakovsky said they flooded the private sector the basement where resident hid from the shelling and now the whole city is on the brink of disaster you see in the private sector the same toilet on the street who kept cattle are also right on the ground manure droppings and it s all flooded now if there is warming there could be very serious consequence kimakovsky said and the worst thing is that ukrainian understand all this very well this speaks to their attitude towards local citizen due to flooding the delivery of food is difficult the people themselves in the city were divided into two part their own and others friend were evacuated stranger left but a for the fighting the explosion of the dam will not affect them much kimakovsky is sure there were frost in the region so water will not be absorbed into the ground but flow into the lowland they did not create serious condition to disrupt our advance in the artemovsk area we are pressing from several direction

resurrected our rescue tug shakhtar came to sevastopol and from it descended safe and sound in full health ukrainian border guard from that very snake they simply abandoned resistance and laid down their arm rape also appeared in the information space they have become one of the dirtiest fake about the russian army hundred and thousand of victim have been reported and all in the brightest detail in completely sick variation it looked something like this a schoolgirl from mariupol told her terrible story occupier rape child old people and corp this is the real headline of one of the ukrainian internet portal the author of the idea with rape is the commissioner for the protection of the right of citizen of ukraine lyudmila denisova she became her guide to the mind of ukrainian and not only ukrainian even in europe entire forum were gathered at one such time zelensky s wife spoke about the atrocity of the russian military the first bell thundered in poland the host of the local tv channel directly asked the commissioner for child s right in ukraine daria gerasymchuk and how many victim there wa nowhere to lie to date the prosecutor general s office of ukraine doe not have a single confirmed fact of violence gerasimchuk replied then denisova herself began to ask specific question where who when fact she couldn t answer any of them that s what burned and she wa fired later denisova admitted they invented all these story and statistic together with her daughter over a cup of tea and then there wa the case my grandmother shot down a drone with a can of pickle yes there are also such invention it happened a few day ago at dawn when she wa sitting on the balcony smoking i saw that something wa moving slowly at first i thought it wa a wounded crow but then i heard a buzz after that the resourceful grandmother grabbed the first weapon at hand a can of pickled cucumber a a result of an accurate throw the drone wa shot down and fell into the courtyard the ukrainian press wrote about the amazing case and what about u most of the fake were shattered by themselves because of their utter incompetence and stupidity others had to be debunked both the medium and blogger were actively involved in this work in social network even specialized channel have appeared that are only engaged in exposing the flow of lie in addition the government ha launched an information portal explain rf it publishes proven news about the progress of the special operation and answer to the main question that arise among the population and for those who still do not relent and continue to breed lie the state duma introduced criminal liability article of the criminal code dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the armed force appeared on it you can get either a fine up to one and a half million ruble or a term of up to year and there are precedent whose ear stick out the flood of these fake is not just invention on the internet this is a big campaign that is completely controlled by the west this wa on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda fm said the president of the analytical company kribrum and a member of the human right council igor ashmanov the operator are the so called cipso the ukrainian center for information and psychological operation it is operated by the th special information operation brigade from london they employ to western pr agency they serve propaganda and set task for it these are hundred of people from very cool office they were engaged in election in the united state in ukraine brexit this is a huge team of professional the special brigade that manages this information war specifically selected people some were even summoned from retirement these are top level propaganda specialist listen a well the west is ready to spend all the money of the world on the destruction of russia more what is happening now in one of the hottest point of the special operation artemovsk bakhmut what is the situation around the city and how are russian force advancing here military expert lieutenant colonel of the people s militia of the lugansk people s republic lpr retired andrei marochko on the radio komsomolskaya pravda spoke in detail about how the work of russian force in the zone of the special military operation is going according to him despite the holiday and weather condition all unit continue to work and do it quite successfully commenting on the current situation in the area of artemovsk the old name of bakhmut where hostility continue the expert noted the importance of the village of khromovo which must be taken by the armed force of the russian federation indeed our volunteer assault unit are now working very effectively from the north of artemovsk and in fact are advancing at a good pace which suggests that artemovsk the group that is in it may be in the operational environment almost in the near future but here is a very important settlement khromovo which we really need to take or at least approach the height that will allow u to observe the situation in it since this road is still used by the enemy to supply the group in artemovsk marochko said the lieutenant colonel also focused on the fact that artemovsk is one continuous fortified area there is a complex terrain again low cloud do not allow in some case to conduct additional reconnaissance with the help of unmanned aerial vehicle but it also work in the direction of the enemy so we can say that the force are equalized the military expert explains at the same time it is important to understand marochko belief that artemovsk itself is an industrial area which affect the advance of the russian military deep into the city a network of industrial enterprise labyrinth of factory basement all this will be used by ukrainian militant in the same way a in mariupol and in severodonetsk lysychansk and rubizhne in the settlement itself there is a non ferrous metal plant where there are underground passage and place where you can hide equipment or place personnel which is what the armed force of ukraine use therefore a long a they have the opportunity they will use such natural shelter the expert belief on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda he also commented on the recent statement of the ukrainian leadership that allegedly the armed force of ukraine will not hold artemovsk at any cost marochko noted that despite these word of zelensky russian force daily record the arrival of fresh force there every day we record the arrival of fresh force in artemivsk despite the statement of president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky that this settlement is allegedly unimportant in fact they promoted it to such an extent that now it is a symbol of the ukrainian troop and if we take it this of course will significantly hit the morale of the ukrainian serviceman who are already not at a very high level the expert summed up listen a well the west is ready to spend all the money of the world on the destruction of russia more since february the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the website kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february in ukraine an air alert wa announced in three region of the country on february siren sounded in poltava kharkiv and dnipropetrovsk region evidenced by the data of the online map of the ukrainian ministry of digital transformation the alarm in these region sounded only a few minute apart the ministry of defense of the russian federation reported that six ukrainian uavs were destroyed during the day in the area of the settlement of merefa liman of the second kharkiv region oleksandrivka of the donetsk people s republic holaya prystan and novaya zburyivka of the kherson region the russian armed force destroyed the command post and ammunition depot of the ukrainian army in the area of avdiivka in the donetsk direction said the official representative of the ministry of defense of the russian federation igor konashenko the russian defense ministry said that over the past day the loss of the armed force of ukraine in the donetsk direction alone amounted to people loss in equipment in this direction amounted to two tank seven armored vehicle howitzer d and d anti tank gun d a well a one artillery system m produced by the united state in connection with the significant accumulation of personnel and military equipment of ukrainian unit near the ukrainian pridnestrovian border recorded by the ministry of defense of the russian federation the deployment of artillery in firing position a well a the unprecedented build up of flight of unmanned aircraft of the armed force of ukraine over the territory of transnistria we warn the united state nato member country and their ukrainian ward against the next adventurous step the russian foreign ministry said today and yesterday the ministry of defense of the russian federation made a statement similar to this the ministry of defense of the russian federation is currently recording a significant accumulation of personnel and military equipment of ukrainian unit near the ukrainian pridnestrovian border the deployment of artillery in firing position a well a an unprecedented increase in flight of unmanned aircraft of the armed force of ukraine over the territory of the pmr both agency warned that in the event of an attack on transnistria where russian peacekeeper are located the protection of our compatriot and military warehouse in the unrecognized republic will be provided with adequate fund two day two statement and to put it mildly not ordinary the situation is really serious and it all started about week ago recall that on february zelensky wa with a group of accomplice in london spoke in parliament showed his blouse to the king of great britain and according to some source together with the head of the office of the president of ukraine and at the same time his right hand andriy yermak had a rendezvous at the headquarters of mi with the leadership of this special service and the very next day upon his return to ukraine he said that ukrainian intelligence had allegedly intercepted document on the preparation of a coup d tat in chisinau by russian terrorist and that he had told maia sandu all the detail of this insidious plan the delirium of course wa fierce many choked when they heard such nonsense allegedly chechen special force from russia flew to turkey under the guise of rescuer from russia and they should return to chisinau already allegedly under the guise of employee of the moldovan ministry of emergency situation realizing that this nonsense did not pa the test of reason and logic kiev proposed another option russia they say intends to seize the airport in chisinau and using it want to transfer troop to moldova there are no fewer question here moldova is surrounded on all side by country to put it mildly unfriendly to u ukraine and romania it is impossible to fly to chisinau through some no man s land or neutral airspace the third version of the provocation looked more sane but it wa only a repetition of hitler s provocation that unleashed the second world war according to this scenario the soldier of the special unit of the armed force of ukraine had to commit an act of aggression against moldova being dressed in russian uniform and using military equipment with the designation adopted for the svo everyone had a good plan but the russian defense ministry revealed it in time and made it public but kiev ha already gathered significant military force from it side of the border while these plan were being prepared and failed moldova quickly changed the government while by and large prime minister natalia gavrilita more focused on economic topic left among the significant figure and sandu s former adviser in the field of defense and national security replaced her in this post a man with a distinct power accent who immediately after his appointment to the post of head of government said that chisinau would seek the demilitarization of transnistria and the withdrawal of russian peacekeeper from the territory of the republic a separate question is where to take them to romania or to ukraine which once again emphasizes the inadequacy of the character but what s interesting now is something else and what is there for all of them in this transnistria with honey that is smeared what draw them there so much after all everything described is clearly not a coincidence it s a chain and it wa clearly not built in kiev and most likely where gentleman perform fife o klock in impeccable costume and not in worn khaki t shirt like their recent guest who need this sausage and why kiev doe not hide it goal which it want to achieve in the course of provocation the first task is to get ammunition from giant warehouse in the village of kolbasna which have been stored there since soviet time although some expert are sure that all shelf life ha already ended there and the ammunition there is unsuitable for use for the same barrel artillery of the armed force of ukraine the ukrainian army is now wildly hungry in term of shell and mine and it is for the soviet caliber of and mm for artillery and and mm for mortar even if percent are still in a usable state this can provide the armed force of ukraine for six month or even for a year the second task that ukraine set for itself is the capture of a large number of russian serviceman in captivity and the replenishment of the exchange fund if it doe not work then the destruction of the russian military in order to deliver a powerful moral blow and block the negative effect of the failure that the armed force of ukraine have been experiencing on the front line for a couple of month if not more the last peremog which kiev pas off almost a a battle victory during the heroic battle wa the abandonment by the russian military of kherson from which our troop came out without loss since then the peremogs have somehow ended there is also a third goal subjected to dastardly russian aggression moldova will simply be obliged to request help either from ukraine or from neighboring romania which position itself a a defender of the orphan and wretched moldovans and bucharest is already a nato country the conflict abruptly go to a completely different level and here the desire of zelensky and kiev and the same london coincide kiev need the direct participation of nato ally with it military britain is also ready for a lot to make the conflict flare up a much a possible there are election coming soon and prime minister sunak s position if not worse than the governor s then clearly not better a for chisinau the president of moldova a citizen of romania maia sandu ha not yet fully decided whether to decide on this adventure or not on the one hand it position is not great rating are flying into the abyss the economy ha more problem than achievement every ten and here the external enemy and a victorious war can distract the people from the dastardly problem and the plus will drop on the rating on the other hand who said that the war would be victorious russia clearly will not leave this unanswered and it remains to be seen how everything will turn out in the end maybe we will have to flee to romania if the people do not like such a provocation very much the most interesting thing in all this is how russia will react to the provocation and here geography come to the fore the village of kolbasna itself next to which there are warehouse is located in the north of the pmr in the rybnytskyi district and from the border with ukraine to it from a kilometer from the north and up to one and a half kilometer from the east for a sharp and unexpected attack with a powerful armored fist this is not a distance moreover the terrain there is completely flat there are no natural obstacle from the east unlike in the west where the natural barrier is in the form of the main river of the region the dniester strictly speaking the dniester is the border between moldova and the pmr which in itself is a defensive line the number of russian serviceman based in the pmr is estimated in different way from to thousand bayonet but the second figure is doubtful there are another serviceman of the pmr itself and it is argued that in the event of the outbreak of hostility the number of the army of the unrecognized republic can be quickly brought to thousand people but thank god no one ha checked this yet there wa no need in addition for most of the past peaceful year tiraspol wa preparing to repel aggression from the west from moldova and not from the east where ukraine is located russia of course can respond economically for example to completely block the gas pipeline through ukraine to europe block all ship that are in the black sea a part of the grain deal but all this take time day and even week and the fate of transnistria will be decided in time there the distance between ukraine and moldova in the widest place of the republic doe not exceed kilometer and in the narrowest only km you can go from one state to another in le than an hour no serious defense can be built in such a space a naval or airborne assault in the pmr is not possible plane will be shot down landing ship will be sunk and russia is left with only one option missile strike only no longer point caliber but something more weighty you can of course try to break through the corridor to odessa a quickly a possible but this is also not fast and threatens with very large loss but an ultimatum to kiev that in the event of aggression decision making center administrative building and office of the authority will be wiped off the face of the earth by pinpoint strike can really work for example the government quarter on bankova street the ministry of defense of ukraine the headquarters of the sbu and the gur in the first by the way on volodymyrska street the entire cia station sits and so on but all this will clearly not be required if kiev refuse to provoke however it is not known whether there is a chance for this and what it is if any listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more when gun rumble the mu are not always silent everyone remembers the famous poem that appeared during the great patriotic war take at least wait for me by konstantin simonov or zemlyanka by alexei surkov and a special military operation give rise to poem sometimes he even make people poet we chose three author who write about the fighting anna is a military officer and an experienced poetess she ha already

at a blind audition pelageya and dima bilan turned to him he chose pelageya a a mentor eventually reached the final and took second place but to say that yaroslav after that became a famous singer will not work he became famous last year when his song let s get up appeared it premiere a it happened took place on february the day before the start of the special operation let s get up while you and i are still alive and the truth is ours someone is looking at u from above with native eye they smiled like child and they stepped into the sky get up and we will become closer to them the song the first patriotic in the work of yaroslav wa dedicated to the hero of the great patriotic war but it very successfully resonated with the mood of thousand of russian a few month later it sounded in it entirety in the program news of the week to date it ha million view on youtube and in january nikolai rastorguev said that it could be considered the anthem of the special operation and soon there wa a song with the chorus i am russian i go to the end i am russian my blood from my father i am russian and i am lucky i am russian the whole world is evil it also became a huge hit the great composer eduard artemyev in one of his last interview said i wa very much hooked and for real shaman ha a mighty soul i m russian is a very good song and it s a great joy to have such a person on our

after the congratulation of the president and the battle of the chime an honor that few were honored with where did the pseudonym shaman come from just fan considered his vocal some kind of shamanic magical wrote about it in the comment in fact paganism is not close to yaroslav he professes orthodoxy and belief that religious motif are in all his song at least in the form of a hint in an interview with kp he said it so happened that i made my way through on my own none of my colleague in show business have ever helped me so i ve never had any contact with them i ve trodden my path and i m comfortable because that s where i met my audience and strangely enough i promoted and continue to promote my song via the internet and again when people tell me that i have a patriotic song i don t really like being pushed into the category of genre because for me it is not a patriotic song but a song from the heart this is my worldview in early shaman performed in a special military operation zone more precisely he first sang in front of the wounded in the military hospital of podolsk and then in front of the serviceman in the kherson region the guy in response thanked me for the performance in their own way they gave a welcome salvo into the sky from their machine gun and machine gun he wrote in his telegram channel so much for russian president vladimir putin s line that life under the administration of kyiv had been sheer hell for the russian speaker of donbas soon rudenska who lived alone wa hiding in the basement with her neighbor they were entirely cut off all the municipal security force police fire and ambulance had been pushed out by the russian she say so when building caught fire in the city they just burned when people were injured they were often left to die and the worst for lyudmila wa that she had no way to contact her daughter who had made it to the safety of italy but wa worried sick about her mother lyudmila meanwhile had no way out of the city under siege she and her neighbor snuck out from the basement only when they dared to line up for water at the few distribution point that existed to gather snow to boil when it fell or to collect the occasional russian ration of macaroni that were hard to boil when water wa scarce and tinned meat that the courtyard cat wouldn t touch or to bury someone in april rudenska found someone to spirit her out in a harrowing trip across russian occupied area she finally made it to western ukraine and then to italy to be reunited with irina in june lyudmila rudenska dream of going home but she doesn t know when or how that will be my arrival at the battalion headquarters began with a sad and unpleasant mission a few day ago a highmars flew to the temporary command post of the vostok i am well aware of what security measure were applied i will not voice them but it still did not help a the head of the engineering service of the leon battalion told me there were two missile the first hit the building and destroyed the ceiling of three floor the second heimers wa next it fell strictly vertically entered the ground almost the entire length of the warhead and didn t work a smiling and kind staff officer with the call sign evil died often call sign are given from the opposite approx corr just a couple of week ago andrei gave me tea in this basement there could have been more victim but the vaunted american technology failed we don t know how or when this projectile might go off leon explains to me who will get to it with plier in naughty hand when peace is finally established here i agree with the sapper that i will shoot in the basement but my duty is to shine a lantern on them and i light a candle while they assemble a sophisticated scheme of detonator and gently lower a bunch of mine into a vertical well somewhere at the bottom lurks overseas death and it is impossible to leave it alone only to destroy we retreat to the soldier standing in the cordon unwind the telephone wire vole one of the sapper hand me a helmet saying put it on the scattering of debris cannot be predicted the underground explosion came out deaf part of the building folded dry concrete dust pulled through the village i went on to the guy who were supposed to go to ugledar tonight i did not go empty handed in rostov there is a group of volunteer girl they call themselves pharmacy fairy from them i wa handed a box with the inscription bosiatsky fitting to steshin and his friend there were lovingly and scientifically wrapped in parchment shmatas of lard loaf of borodino a set of sauce cigarette lighter a box of hematogen for the prevention of cold from myself i reported several pack of the best coffee and coffee is drunk here just without stopping moreover there are many connoisseur who understand the variety and method of brewing now it is easy to do trench candle and gas burner have ceased to be exotic a one of the fighter remarked to me there is little snow but you can always scrape together for coffee and i always have a burner and a mug in the marauder the so called special pouch for dropping empty magazine collecting all sort of ownerless but useful or interesting thing approx corr i caught the legendary fox scout doing a meditation session he tastefully that s how aesthete try cigar packed his backpack for a night out for rotation i started the conversation with a stupidly provocative question fox there is a sense of celebration the fox weighed one of his backpack he did not like the weight and he remarked like the holiday is always with me on february li planned to celebrate a befits a defender of the motherland on the front line the fox said a few word to those who are now preparing at the training ground listen to everything absorb make sure that the instructor do not pour water do not teach in the shooting rack to stand let them explain more about everyday life on the front line hi i want to convey it s easy hello to our medical training instructor they talk about the golden hour during which the wounded must be evacuated corr so we have it for at least four hour i now have to walk to the position about kilometer no closer in order to have no illusion learn to provide primary assistance to yourself and your friend at the last rotation i met with the guy from kamchatka talked i found out that they do not know how to apply a tourniquet like they taught but they didn t learn yes it s important let them buy rubber boot do not hesitate than you heat up trench candle gas burner if the entrance is blocked by a blanket or a tent cloak and it is minus ten outside it will be inside and it even seems that it is warm almost hot the offensive at ugledar in the last week slowed down ours went to the so called dacha on the outskirt of the city clung to them and stood in the active defense fox in conversation recalled that he only see what is happening in his sector on the front line but he happened to talk to the prisoner taken the other day and what he said did not really fit in his head i don t understand the behavior of the opponent captive reservist say that there are practically no young people in the trench they are knocked out i emphasize she did not desert but wa knocked out the median age is year why did that happen young people are more active the first one dy here are from my observation a ukrainian dugout a closed gap with a loophole in our direction near him are eye an observer here he is just standing leaning out of the trench to the waist and i ve come across this more than once either this inexperience or the conscious action of the command of the armed force of ukraine are engaged in the loss of personnel don t understand they have big loss i generally have the impression that they have been brought here for slaughter lately there is no other explanation what struck me about the prisoner story the word punishers they used it themselves in what context according to them it turn out that punishers are brought to their position and those who remain are also punishers who remain moreover the route are built so that they do not intersect they are forbidden to communicate some were taken out others were brought in nonsense out of logic you take position from the shifter they tell you like here we put the signal mine here are the banner there on the left a machine gunner appeared working in the evening it turn out that they are brought in and put in a pit without explaining anything and there were such option he wa caught on the street four day later he wa already near ugledar and a week later he wa notified that he died in the donbas i do not understand what task the ukrainian command face the extermination of the male part of the population it turn out that it is of course no one on the front line will celebrate the day of the defender of the fatherland a it is customary to celebrate in peaceful year sometimes forgetting it essence but there were a few minute of sincere joy when they sorted out delicious gift from the rear and read aloud a warm letter from the pharmacy fairy i do not know whether there is a similar holiday on the other side of the line of contact most likely it wa also canceled a part of the decommunization but about our holiday tam know clearly at exactly o clock donetsk wa hit by highrs and i finished the end of this report sitting on the floor between the capital wall it fell very close by on rosa luxemburg street right in front of the entrance to the music school there wa no one there after all it wa a holiday and child in donetsk had long been studying remotely three missile intercepted our air defense so the center today did without casualty this is indeed a very expensive gift for a front line city listen a well oleksandr kots the operation to liberate artemovsk will take several more week more if recently someone still doubted the need for a special operation to protect donbas today much ha become clear fact have emerged that confirm that extreme measure were required and there wa no time to delay when vladimir putin announced the recognition of the dpr and lpr ukrainian artillery wa already shelling city and militia position it wa an artillery preparation before the offensive child woman and the elderly were evacuated from donetsk deep into russia if it were not for the special operation the fighting would still have begun but on our territory yes exactly near avdiivka in an abandoned dugout russian special force found a map the mark on which unequivocally indicated the plan of the command of the armed force of ukraine to attack taganrog and even rostov on don to what other territory the appetite of the warrior of the independent country extended it remains to be guessed back in the noughties long before the maidan there wa popular speculation among ukrainian nationalist that the entire russian south including kuban and stavropol should be ukrainian it seems that the current ukrainian authority share these idea ukraine wa not going to negotiate the fate of donbas with either russia or anyone else the entire minsk negotiation process wa only a way to buy time to prepare for war after the start of the special operation the mask were dropped poroshenko zelensky frau merkel and monsieur hollande publicly admitted that all these normandy format were needed only to delay time and give kiev the opportunity to arm itself but the agreement were approved in the un security council in the hand of the russian military got document that more than three dozen secret biological laboratory operate on the territory of ukraine u s under secretary of state victoria nuland confirmed that the laboratory exist she wa very concerned that the research material could fall into the hand of our military russian expert conducted an investigation and the head of the radiation chemical and biological protection troop of russia lieutenant general igor kirillov said the pentagon wa aimed at creating component of biological weapon and testing them on the population of ukraine and other neighboring state with russia an example is the experiment related to hiv infection which were conducted by american specialist in ukraine since the general said all this crap would sooner or later be on our territory and in the united state only hand would be spread we have seen nothing we do not know anything over the past month all doubt about who we are fighting have disappeared not with ukraine but in ukraine with the help of the independent west it is trying to weaken russia a much a possible and in a favorable scenario for them to defeat anti russian sanction and speculation that our country in it current form should cease to exist the supply of tank and heavy weapon the provision of intelligence from satellite the undermining of nord stream and western mercenary on the frontline the disruption of negotiation and the blessing of ukraine to fight to the last ukrainian all this for one goal to bring russia to it knee just the other day nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said that for the alliance hostility began in in fact since nato ha implemented the largest reinforcement of collective defense in a generation stoltenberg said at a news conference in brussels this is the largest adaptation of the alliance the introduction of increased readiness of our force strengthening on the eastern flank increasing the number of exercise for eight year nato ha tried by all mean to master ukraine militarily to get closer to our border if the special operation had not started earlier it would have had to be started now but stopping the advance of the north atlantic alliance would be even more difficult during the special operation the ukrainian and western elite more than once highlighted plan for the arrangement of the defeated russia take for example the so called budanov map in which the head of ukrainian intelligence kirill budanov presented his vision of the territorial division after the victory of ukraine from russia on this map would remain a small piece in the european part the urals and siberia should become a central asian republic and the entire far east should go to china ukraine in these plan regains the crimea and donbas and even go further in the west they have long dreamed of turning our country into a puzzle of specific principality so the budanov map probably appealed to many there pumping ukraine with weapon and supporting offensive attempt can be considered a stage in the implementation of this plan relation between russia and ukraine after of course did not ooze warmth but most of u only after the start of the special operation realized how much the consciousness of the inhabitant of ukraine had changed during these eight anti russian year in kindergarten at matinee child there sang about the murder of moskals guy enrolled in natsbats and stabbed nazi tattoo the demolition of soviet monument the glorification of bandera and other inhuman murderer russia s clash with such a ukraine wa inevitable and if a fight cannot be avoided then a coach teach beginner in hand to hand combat you need to beat first in that last february zelensky spoke in munich at a security conference and he hinted that he could return ukraine to the status of a nuclear power a few month later the armed force of ukraine tried to arrange a provocation with the so called dirty bomb it ha nuclear component and recently the former commander of the polish ground force general waldemar skrzypczak admitted that ukraine already posse nuclear weapon maybe there s something we don t know about it and what about the trend of recent day the armed force of ukraine from drone drop container with chemistry on our position and the west will not even threaten with a finger wa it really necessary to wait until zelensky moved from word to deed by taking a wait and see attitude we risked getting a state hostile to russia with nuclear chemical and biological weapon which is also passionately eager to join nato listen a well the west is ready to spend all the money of the world on the destruction of russia more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru

a man who did not escape but remained on his land work on it and is not afraid of anything whatever happens around banned in the russian federation organization listen a well kiev is preparing another provocation against russia more missile strike on the center of information and psychological operation hereinafter referred to a the center for information and psychological operation in kiev and brovary last year were carried out at night so a not to put it employee at risk but the cynical employee did not appreciate humanism they went from the office to remote where they only intensified information and psychological sabotage and the more the armed force of ukraine suffer loss in their hybrid war the closer it soldier are to despair the more actively the tsipso is working to discredit the svo under poroshenko the cipso recruited anyone on the internet and therefore among his saboteur were many russian hacker and intelligence officer one of them wa the hacker of the beregini group who today are trying to publish update of western manual which sends the cipso to the email address of it many thousand of sofa troop and warns about new provocation of kiev but few place say that most of the member of this virtual community have been on the hook of western intelligence agency since do not think that everyone is paid money in the cipso someone can first get small amount into the account but later this lead to private accusation of receiving income for participating in ddos attack on government or private site other illegal invasion of privacy illegal action the largest and most obstinate player are arrested from time to time by western special service and hold show trial after such pressure the specialist begin to unquestioningly although not always qualitatively perform task informed source told kp the structure of the cipso is quite multifaceted but it is united by the nature of the action that are conducted remotely employee of these center are aimed at rocking the situation collecting information about the mood of resident of russian city undermining their trust in the army and the authority to do this we use a call with the substitution of number for our russian citizen by bank employee policeman investigator doctor who not only shamelessly steal the electronic wallet of pensioner but also simultaneously declare the mining of school kindergarten and shopping center their task is to show that our law enforcement agency are so weak that they are unable to protect citizen from crime although everything ha long been clear that there are such center today even from a number of european country and two such call center were discovered and liquidated during the svo in berdyansk and mariupol other psychologist of the center organize radical and nationalist movement with website such organization are already banned in russia where citizen with mental disability are selected in private chat they are first instructed for money to paste warning announcement about maniac in park on tree then leaflet and flag then various illegal action and then intimidating with the kompromat collected on them they are sent to set fire to police station and military commissariat shoot child in school or eliminate individual citizen a number of similar episode are being investigated by the investigative committee of russia the other day the fsb of russia announced that since august foreign special service have literally settled on popular russian postal service citizen steal mail telegram channel create duplicate of social page from them scammer are trying to find out secret information from the military or official on behalf of the journalist they can appeal to the head of the region with a request to report the phone of the relative of the cvo participant for the preparation of the material they ask for the number of death for humanitarian assistance they are interested in the address of compact residence of refugee the specific of the work of military enterprise such pseudo request come to e mail on form with the symbol of russian state service and department and even to the personal phone of official the author of appeal can be introduced by minister journalist artist director of enterprise and return address are often similar in name to the domain name of federal executive body the fsb warns and advises to check suspicious correspondence it is also advised to contact the author of the letter to clarify the detail and secretary are advised to not respond to these letter and not to open attachment to them after all email can be not only intelligence but accompanied by sabotage program discrediting the warrior of the svo is being conducted today in all direction the cipso receives data about them from ukrainian and western military intelligence and they have access to application banned in russia through which relative sometimes continue to communicate with military personnel then everyone wonder why shell so accurately fly into the place of deployment of our troop a if they were not warned that the picture from the smartphone ha a binding to the coordinate the psychologist of the cips use contact of relative of the svo participant for mocking provocation posing a ukrainian serviceman they tell someone s mother or father on the phone that they will now take away some part of their son s body extort money such call cause unrest among the relative of the unit s serviceman which spill over into the network they can also introduce themselves a employee of military recruitment office who take the body of the murdered person home lawyer lawyer postal worker courier in parallel on the internet the cipso creates website with the name of russian unit where they urge relative to discus incoming call describe non existent conflict between unit commander and in order to undermine the credibility of the commander of these unit they write that the son do not have enough ammunition and ammunition yesterday the russian ministry of defense had to officially refute the report of the cipso about the alleged dismissal of officer of the st donetsk and nd lugansk army corp after their entry into the russian army in such a chat they can also drop some order to shave the beard of chechen soldier or a ban on praying rumor can be difficult to extinguish since our serviceman may be on the front line and communication with them is difficult having found out in the correspondence the phone number and address of the family of the svo warrior the employee of the cipso switch the participant themselves they begin to call and threaten that while they are away from home trouble may happen to their loved one they call the name of loved one address it is clear that after such threat it becomes difficult for fighter to focus on service there is growing psychological pressure on russian citizen who take russian citizenship in the liberated territory and if the cache that the ukrainian special service leave for saboteur in the liberated territory are found quite quickly thanks to modern search equipment then it is difficult to eliminate the page and site that are mined with the entire internet these are not iron leopard that can be tracked during the transfer across the border and transportation to the front line here thousand of account are shot with million of green paper which instantly turn into russophobic post statement investigation in the liberated territory intimidation of the population and new chapter is in full swing thus employee of the cipso on behalf of the former ukrainian mayor of melitopol ivan fedorov in the city he wa jokingly nicknamed the mayor at a distance daily declare the inevitable return of the region under the control of the armed force of ukraine threaten resident with reprisal for cooperation with the russian army and they are also discrediting humanitarian support for the population with all their might in recent day fake have been increasingly planted that the new head of district have no experience in managerial activity all corrupt official discredit their image in every possible way or they claim that russian troop are allegedly preparing the evacuation of civilian from the zaporozhye region after which they will surrender it to kiev there can be no question of any evacuation from the zaporizhzhya region the administration of the region is at work all service are operating normally we are reliably protected from any provocation the current head of the melitopol administration yevgeny balitsky reassures citizen daily he like many other head of district asks resident not to panic remain calm and not to believe fake news which continues to multiply online according to western manual by bandera member of the st century the cynicism of the cipso is a striking distinguishing feature especially if the target audience of the stuffing is ukrainian only the cipso can appropriate video footage of russian volunteer handing over dead ukrainian serviceman in coffin and claiming that it is in the coffin of a troupe of russian fighter only they can call their telegram channel like crimea is the land of partisan glory or dress a ukrainian drug addict in a russian uniform but leave ukrainian legging on it while placing a chevron on his right hand and writing a post with a text in which the ukrainian i slip through and also theatrically smash the head of stormtrooper dmytro yakushchenko with a sledgehammer accusing him of betrayal and then forget about it and exchange him for ukrainian serviceman now the murdered yakushchenko tell the network about how ukrainian forced him to commit this staged dramatization under the threat of death of his relative now the tsipso is turning a soldier of the armed force of ukraine sergei makarenko who shot russian prisoner some kind of superman he declares from every iron that he will continue to kill and live forever although according to some report he along with other killer wa transferred to the rear unit where he record his immortal video according to the staff of the cipso the immortal makarenko should show that war crime in ukraine are not only encouraged by the command but also go unpunished and yesterday it became known about the delivery to ukraine from europe of several container with radioactive material

fillmore calmly state a few minute before our passage the enemy wa processing duty target entering along the road connecting soledar and krasnaya gora a suburb of artemovsk bakhmut a luck would have it there were several car in one place at once which fell under fire car slowly flared up raising a black column of smoke into the sky together with the attendant we turn around and drive through the field we drove everything here on the trawl ourselves there should be no mine fillmore set up an optimistic mood i stopped in soledar to visit the wagner pmc to the accompaniment of artillery explosion and the music of whistling mine the company s fighter were able to storm this settlement in two week the operation wa now developed by the hero of russia with the call sign lotus in the past a paratrooper officer however paratrooper are not former the modern way to storm city is to cover them but at the same time we must not forget that the coverage should go on a broad front that is with the possibility of maneuver to push back the enemy s reserve which can go to the flank or rear of the attacking grouping lotus explained to me at the entrance to the city the sooner we notice the enemy the sooner we begin to use artillery and our own firepower tank atgms etc the closer the enemy ha come the harder it is for u to stop him because the shell ha a scattering of fragment up to meter so when the enemy come close to u we can no longer use artillery so is the enemy and when we come close it is almost impossible to stop u because the armed force of ukraine cannot withstand the shooting battle there would be more ammunition unfortunately with the active advance the stormers begin to experience shell hunger which must be quenched promptly in order not to lose offensive inertia and there is someone to find a use for ammunition here when i wa still serving in the army my commander always said first knowledge and then rank therefore i tried to transfer this principle of work to our company the chief of artillery of the musician shared with me we have professional competition if any flight commander begin to professionally reduce his level then another person will be appointed in his place who will perform the task faster and better in this conflict we first encountered nato artillery not for the first time we came here already learned the lesson of other nato artillery i m not going to say which one now but we ve met more than once she taught u a lot life forced the development of new tactic for conducting combat operation by artillery unit but i won t tell you about it you should clearly understand that weapon are just iron it all depends on the people if the personnel what is on our part what is on the other side will be professionally trained there will be a result if people who simply do not know how to use them are put on new modern weapon the result will be different and how do you as the personnel of the enemy firstly both in soviet time and in the post soviet era the ukrainian school of artillery ha always been famous for it specialist they are great since they have deployed all artillery school and are training professional well we draw conclusion take action quickly soledar wa a strategic node of defense of the north of the artyomovsk agglomeration on which the logistics chain of the enemy were tied having liberated it the musician with the support of the artillery of the armed force of russia advanced closer to bakhmut itself liberating first it suburb krasnaya gora and then engaged in fighting in paraskovievka through which the highway to slavyansk leaf i am taken to red mountain by fillmore who ha been fighting in the company for almost six month the first contract soon end and after a short vacation he is going to return to his squad where he ha already made a career from an ordinary private to a sergeant major in the rear and tray service the position doe not sound combative but imagine that ammunition water and provision should be delivered to the front line and from there to pick up the wounded and all this with your foot under fire fillmore know all the path and path in the area so he wa dressed up a our escort who wa he i ask the hoarse boy after a short pause he reply the combat orchestra a you know at one time recruited volunteer from among the convict and the native of volgodonsk fillmore is one of them by the age of there are already two walker the first a he say for his for the wallet that he pulled from the car the second for nothing i just drove my friend to the robbery but i did not participate in it myself on svo he assures he rethought his view on life how can you not respect yourself in order to sit down again after all this i remember asking one you only had a month to sit and you were in the heat for six month with an unobvious chance of staying alive why and i want to come home a a man he reply not to be ashamed in front of mom and dad and next to the former inmate are reserve officer here is an elderly fighter with glass and a gray beard it seems modest call sign pocha lieutenant colonel ex head of the group of the operational and analytical department of the gru of the general staff i resigned in when we were downsizing or rather fired when the president announced a partial mobilization a a patriot of his homeland he immediately called the military recruitment office guy i am ready the answer is from there a long a there is no order there are no order we ourselves do not know what to do with you i went to the military enlistment office more than once asked for a lower position in any case i am ready to go and defend the motherland they don t take it i came to wagner here i wa received here we have a brotherhood we are all the same equal you can go to the commander and say what you think and get an answer so you a former gru lieutenant colonel are now fighting a an ordinary stormtrooper i ask again on a par with former prisoner yes and they re all my family in a forest belt we stop the car then on foot on the left meter away shell explode they are our mortar trying to get the escort explain on the right is the artillery of the musician working to suppress and we walk along the path of the dwarf forest the height of which doe not exceed human height all bush and tree are literally cut off with metal at first i thought it wa the job of shell fragment until we hit two machine gun emplacement from which the enemy wa watering our stormtroopers it s scary to imagine what the density of the fire wa along the trail here and there there are pile of body of armed force soldier sprinkled with snow they are pulled out of broken dugout and trench and stacked to be exchanged for their dead cargo to the other side go in cargo column the ratio of loss is of ours to of the enemy the artyomovsk meat grinder continues to harvest it bloody harvest red mountain is a strategic point here the terrain allows u to conduct reconnaissance artillery training the deputy platoon commander meet u in the basement of one of the broken building the assault is very difficult the enemy is well prepared for defense machine gun nest are not even broken by a grenade launcher from the first time but thanks to cunning we bypassed and destroyed these position although they last until the last cartridge we re fine with intelligence we know exactly where the enemy is in what quantity where is the machine gun where is the mortar suppress the artillery then move the castle platoon is from the orphanage independently got up on his foot equipped himself with a box wa engaged in the repair of car painter bodywork electrician like everything wa enough got married had a child but he wa tempted to make easy money through fraud with payment of insurance company for osago and he went to the colony under the article fraud together we move in short run along red mountain and the stormtrooper tell how he knocked the enemy out of every house upstairs i had a sniper sitting there suddenly the arrival there the entrance crumbles i think well that s it the sniper is gone and he didn t make it to the edge of the house he wa tying a shoelace then i arrived here the roof wa all fucking i wa already standing here three second earlier and i wouldn t be standing here now by the way do you see all this destruction when they cleaned up all these building were still intact a soon a the enemy wa completely knocked out of here he scattered everything with artillery we will not go further there is a rut a what throw artillery we use slang and jargon for radio exchange and how it will be to go on the attack on style fillmore and i are on style tomorrow and what will you do when you return home ask i don t know maybe i ll go to africa with the company if my wife allows nearby heavy machine gun sang the armed force of ukraine not thinking to surrender tried to break through the position captured by the musician but stumbled upon a competent defense meanwhile the assault squad continue to cover paraskovievka in order to cut off the northern logistics route of bakhmut the highway is already blocked and is completely under our fire control one of the commander formerly from the internal troop told me the encirclement of paraskovievka itself is coming to an end there are already battle in it at the same time the enemy u field road in the dark it is very difficult to detect the delivery behind paraskovievka we go further we work for the full encirclement of artemovsk the enemy understands that he is partially blocked but there is no loss of control there they seriously resist they do not experience shell hunger but we will definitely press them kstat western plane will not help kiev i briefly managed to talk to the commander of the wagner air group he asked if ukrainian pilot would quickly master nato fighter we see that they are quickly adjusting their equipment to the use of the same western made ammunition yes there will be some problem maintenance spare part it s long tedious and more for information noise but again the same f what will it do here our air defense is nearby he will not be able to enter our air defense is much more effective than ukraine s so let them come we see that the enemy had heavy loss in aviation we all have experienced people they probably have only young people left in aviation you need experience to work properly just pulling the handle is stupid a there used to be an expression pen gas pay here it will not work and experience is gained only over time and in different combat condition we have a lot of people going through other hot spot therefore we work a best we can we work well and efficiently listen a well will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more the ministry of defense reported alarming news in order to implement a high profile provocation from the territory of one of the european state several container with radioactive substance were delivered to ukraine bypassing custom inspection their accomplice of the head of the kiev regime are going to use to stage a local contamination of the area in the area of one of the radiation hazardous object controlled by the kiev regime the defense ministry said the kiev regime is preparing a provocation for the opening of the th emergency special session of the un general assembly there official kiev plan to show it powell test tube and accuse russia of allegedly gross violation of the obligation of the convention on nuclear safety during a special military operation the purpose of the provocation is to accuse the armed force of the russian federation of allegedly inflicting indiscriminate strike on radiation hazardous facility of ukraine which led to the leakage of radioactive substance and contamination of the area the military department emphasized komsomolka told about these plan of western special service in the material of february the west need an information explosion of chernobyl in order to give birth to the world powell s test tube then the interdepartmental coordination headquarters of russia for humanitarian response exposed the detail of the provocation from the chernobyl nuclear power plant being prepared by western special service and reported on the preparation by the kiev regime with the support of the united state and european country of a large scale information provocation great event to accuse russia listen a well dmitry steshin the use of chemical weapon will not bring victory to kiev more the political editor of the british newspaper the time caroline wheeler wa allowed to go on an excursion to zelensky s bunker in kiev and made a very gloomy impression of this visit the journalist titled her report bleakly inside zelensky s bunker no phone no light no sleep of course in it material there are enough familiar western clich s and conclusion are sometimes drawn on a dubious knowledge of reality for example wheeler writes in the very first line that on the day of her arrival kiev wa subjected to the most intense blow which apparently wa the kremlin s response to president zelensky s tour of the uk and europe during which new promise of arm supply and sanction against russia were received probably in her opinion this is how military operation are carried out but the journalist wa able to notice many interesting detail reflecting the oppressive atmosphere of the place where the current ukrainian hetman life sometimes parallel come to mind with another bunker in which the german f hrer committed suicide also trying to make nazism a new religion here s what she writes the most striking thing that catch your eye when entering bankova the ukrainian equivalent of downing street is how dark it is inside all curtain are drawn and the light are off to reduce the threat that the building will become a target for air attack or sniper i thought darkness wa a temporary measure due to the last raid but i wa told it wa done on a permanent basis a the guard escorted me through the vast corridor and up the grand staircase i couldn t even see my leg and could only walk thanks to the flashlight on his phone bank a concrete block of office surrounded by a steel ring checkpoint with armed guard are located on every street surrounding the complex and access is granted only to those who have the relevant document civilian car can t get close and soldier ask pedestrian for secret password that change daily often meaningless phrase that would be difficult for russian to pronounce obviously something like the notorious palyanitsa because only russian will certainly break through the cordon the british woman belief ed earlier in the day security personnel picked me up at one of the checkpoint and drove me in a van through several more barrier before entering the courtyard through a huge metal gate inside window door and former grand staircase are littered with sandbag sitting in the waiting room where the eerie twilight wa still lit only by the light of the phone i watched a military adviser in khaki uniform fussily entered and exited the office shortly thereafter a soldier sitting nearby jumped to his foot others in the room also stretched out on the counter peacefully a zelenskiy who wa easily recognizable by his small stature and signature black hoodie that read i am ukrainian walked through the hall accompanied by a group of adviser wheeler report interesting detail of zelensky s stay in the bunker at the beginning of the svo ukrainian propagandist strongly denied report that the president wa hiding in a secluded place it turned out to be so the journalist report according to one government source the original plan wa to stay underground for a week but event outside forced a change of plan zelenskiy and his most senior aide have spent most of the two month living underground periodically surfacing to the surface to reassure people he hasn t escaped those allowed to live alongside the president in an underground bunker had to sign a non disclosure agreement prohibiting them from sharing any detail about the bunker s interior or amenity they weren t even allowed to talk about the food they ate the complete inadequacy in which zelensky s entourage resides can be said by the following passage from the report in the time an isolated team below watched the fighting through their iphones a few hour after the start of the special operation the guard turned off the light when a shootout broke out around the government quarter i wonder who is with whom ed and issued bulletproof vest and assault rifle to zelensky and a dozen of his assistant the head of the office of the president of ukraine yermak wa furious that hundred of russian singer artist and influential people who support the svo were free to travel around the west bankova wa shocked when philip kirkorov who ha been described a putin s favourite singer attended a grammy award ceremony in los angeles this month listen a well dmitry steshin the use of chemical weapon will not bring victory to kiev more just the other day a new israeli foreign minister eli cohen arrived in kiev on a visit the ukrainian leadership pinned special hope on him the head of israeli diplomacy wa expected to be a strongly condemn rossi b will no le resolutely support ukraine c agree to the supply of weapon from israel to kiev and announce them first of all about air defense and pr system d announce the provision by israel of a soft loan in the amount of at least million u dollar kiev even went to a real scandal on the eve of the visit announcing that if cohen doe not live up to the hope placed on him of course from the independent state then let him not even count on a rendezvous and a photo shoot with zelensky and maybe not even come for that matter but cohen arrived went to bucha and babi yar it is noteworthy that the israeli foreign minister drove along stepan bandera avenue to the site of mass execution of jew without the support of kiev of course could not do i came to say israel support ukraine and the ukrainian people in difficult time this phrase wa the first thing that cohen said when he stepped off the bandwagon of the train on which they came from poland but with everything else somehow it didn t work out cohen did not live up to the hope of zelensky and the head of ukrainian diplomacy dmytro kuleba even with credit apparently bargaining it wa announced that israel wa ready to provide loan guarantee for million moreover for the targeted restoration of civilian infrastructure not a word of condemnation of russia came out of cohen s mouth nor wa a single promise made in the field of armament not even the know how invented in kiev which ha so far worked flawlessly on high ranking visitor from a well fed and calm europe did not help in the midst of negotiation between kuleba and cohen an air raid siren sounded this is a well known invention of zelensky s team a soon a one of the high representative arrives in kiev immediately he is led somewhere in the bomb shelter to the sound of an air alarm which by coincidence is necessarily nearby and there are already local resident who accidentally sat there for at least a couple of hour waiting for distinguished guest and begin to tell them for life and russia s aggression for european such sound are adventure in themselves the president of the federal republic of germany fell for this bait charles michel or josep borrell angelina jolie sean penn and some others rushed to the bomb shelter under these siren although in none of the above case were there any shelling in thought and not that in reality with cohen they decided to do the same trick although no threat in reality wa even close but with the israeli in kiev clearly overreacted eli wa born and raised in israel where such siren sound almost on a daily basis and child often play on the sidewalk to the explosion of downed or reaching the target of missile in addition he managed to serve in the idf rising to the rank of major all in all this cheap operetta clearly had no effect on him it is possible that deep in his soul he laughed at the na ve ukrainian who decided to deceive him with the help of cunning the wrong one wa attacked listen a well dmitry steshin the use of chemical weapon will not bring victory to kiev more the russian defense ministry denied the report of some source about the alleged dismissal of officer of the st donetsk and nd lugansk army corp after their entry into the russian armed force from january the personnel of the st army donetsk corp and the nd guard army lugansk severodonetsk corp in full composition with

operation before the end of the year more just over a year ago yulia bondarenko s day were full of lesson plan grading and her student seventh grade hormone when russian missile shattered that routine and russian troop threatened her home in kyiv ukraine s capital m bondarenko volunteered to fight back despite her lack of experience the grave risk to her life and ukraine s apparently impossible odds i never held a rifle in my hand and never even saw one up close m bondarenko said in the first two week i felt like i wa in a fog it wa just a constant nightmare for week she had followed the ominous news of russian troop massing on ukraine s border and decided on feb to enlist a a reservist the next day the largest land war in europe since world war ii began a explosion shook kyiv m bondarenko took the subway to report for duty uncertain the recruiting office would take her without finished paperwork or a fitness exam but in the chaotic swirl of volunteer officer asked no question they handed her a rifle and bullet and assigned her to a unit expecting to fight in urban combat if the russian army broke into the capital she wa only one recruit in a huge influx of volunteer who swelled the size of ukrainian force from about soldier to about one million today and whose life were transformed by the war in a recent interview m bondarenko recalled the intense stress of those early day unaccustomed to the sound of artillery she said she expected to be hit after every blast she thought she would die step by step she learned how to be a soldier fellow volunteer showed her how to load aim and fire her kalashnikov rifle they practiced trench fighting and other tactic during the weekslong battle for kyiv m bondarenko and about other volunteer almost all men lived in a shopping mall rotating through shift at checkpoint in the city she and two other woman changed in a bathroom away from the men it wa so cold at night she slept hugging one of the other female soldier slowly sleeping bag mat and warm uniform turned up and the unit eventually made it to a barrack not all of the new recruit needed training eight year of fighting against russia backed separatist in eastern ukraine ha schooled a generation of ukrainian soldier about in trench warfare on the plain the type of combat dominating the war today many veteran returned to active service when the full scale invasion began in the week after ukraine fended off russia from the capital and a russian troop retreated in the spring the fighting shifted to the east m bondarenko wa offered a chance to resign or take a position in a desk job or a a cook she overcame her fear and chose to stay with the infantry living in the barrack and training for campaign to come like other recruit without experience m bondarenko learned on the job how to find trip wire and explosive trap to duck for cover from shell to provide battlefield first aid at first she worried about her ability bookish and shy she never had any interest in the military and knew nothing of weapon or war but on patrol and at the firing range handling supply and learning tactic her confidence grew it wa pleasant when the guy said it s working out with you she said and they said i would go into battle with you her brigade wa stationed in a village south of kyiv where soldier formed relationship with resident they frequented a shop for snack and m bondarenko grew close to a local math teacher but at spring s end they had to say goodbye they were heading toward the northeastern kharkiv region toward the front in the northeast the unit came under near constant russian shelling over the summer m bondarenko helped handle logistics and supply to keep ukraine s force fighting patriotism and learning the history of moscow s repression of ukrainian had motivated her to enlist in the first place she said she had moved to kyiv from a village in central ukraine for university study arriving shortly before mass street protest toppled a pro russia president in during the political awakening that followed she re evaluated her family s history and found injustice from russia s long rule in ukraine during soviet time she said a hydroelectric dam had flooded her village khudyaki but the authority did nothing to relocate resident villager had to salvage what they could from their home and rebuild on higher ground when i became older i understood how history wa taught incorrectly in school she said even a green new soldier swelled it rank ukraine adopted dozen of new western donated weapon by the fall it had gained strength ukraine counterattacked and upending long held idea of the balance of military force in europe defeated the russian army on the battlefield in two successful offensive in kharkiv and kherson region over the new year s holiday m bondarenko wa given a respite she returned to kyiv where she got to indulge in joy from before the war a new haul of book delivered to her apartment coffee with friend time with her sister and year old niece she also used her leave to visit her year old mother hanna bondarenko at her village in central ukraine where she had grown up speaking ukrainian in contrast to the russian spoken in kyiv s cafe but her anger at russia had simmered a moscow fomented fighting over the past eight year and she had long switched to speaking ukrainian in public when russia invaded her mother said she at least felt a sense of relief that her daughter would not be drafted i wa happy i didn t have a son because i didn t have to worry about him going off to war she said i never imagined my daughter would sign up her daughter said she tried to stave off some feeling while her unit wa deployed she feel guilt about her mother s fear for her and miss teaching and her boyfriend she keep a box of letter from former student at home when i am away on the base or in the field i try to shut down emotionally she said the backpack she carried held a small part of her life a a teacher book some were child s book that she sometimes read to cheer up fellow soldier but she said that she needed to serve her country meaning that before long she had to make another round of goodbye parting with her boyfriend in kyiv she said she thought of his daily fear and their hope for the future the relationship she said show me that even in the dark there can be light of the many volunteer she ha met over the past year many were deployed to eastern ukraine where fighting is raging and m bondarenko know some who have been killed she ha not yet fired her rifle in combat but if her platoon is sent to the front she said she feel ready to fight i am an infantry soldier now she said nato secretary general jens stoltenberg at the munich security conference said that russia s victory in ukraine for the north atlantic alliance is more dangerous than the escalation of hostility what is the west so afraid of what goal did russia pursue when launching a military special operation to protect the donbas about this political observer of the kp ru alexander gamov talked with a well known politician first deputy chairman of the state duma committee on international affair president of the russkiy mir foundation vyacheslav nikonov vyacheslav alekseevich what in your opinion were the main reason for russia s recognition of the donbas republic and the decision to conduct a special operation this is a whole complex of reason the main of which of course is the humanitarian catastrophe that broke out in the donbas after the kiev regime launched an eight year war destroying thousand of resident of donetsk lugansk donetsk and lugansk people s republic who opposed the anti constitutional coup in kiev people really died russian people who wanted to speak their native language in russian who wholeheartedly sought to be in alliance with our country who advocated good neighborly relation with russia external force the policy of the european union the united state somehow influenced the development of the situation in the direction of the conflict of course the geopolitical situation also played a huge role the united state wa turning ukraine into a nato military bridgehead preparing to deploy it fleet in odessa in ochakov in mariupol preparing to install it missile on our border naturally we could not allow this to happen russia took all the necessary diplomatic step proposed solution to the conflict related to the implementation by nato of the agreement signed by nato on the nato russia founding act which did not imply the presence of nato armed force in the new state russia asked for guarantee of non expansion of nato to the country of eastern europe but the western partner abandoned their own promise to soviet leader gorbachev in exchange for dissolving the warsaw pact opponent of the svo believe that it would be better to keep the situation with the dpr and lpr in a frozen state in a state of no peace no war by the end of the russian federation had intelligence data later confirmed that the ukrainian armed force their nato patron were preparing genocide in the donbas an offensive against the republic in march therefore the operation wa carried out a a preventive one our cause is just of course our cause is right the victory will be ours the enemy will be defeated certainly in parenthesis a soon a we take paraskovievka or avdiivka listen a well dmitry steshin the use of chemical weapon will not bring victory to kiev more the armed force of ukraine used ammunition with a toxic chemical substance near ugledar a a result two russian serviceman were injured two copters were used a a mean of delivery one of them managed to reach our position the remains of the ammunition were sent for examination gennady grigorievich here is such alarming information the armed force of ukraine used a munition with a poisonous substance near ugledar it wa dropped on the position of the allied force from an attack copter on february you have dealt a lot with this topic and participated in international symposium what kind of ammunition is this what kind of damage can it do how to fight against this and do we have such opportunity well if the munition it mean it wa manufactured for military purpose another thing is what kind of it is homemade or factory if it is factory then it is easy to determine by the shell which country it belongs to judging by the fact that our serviceman there were vomiting tearing and so on this charge wa calculated only for an irritating effect that is no death were recorded it is possible that it wa also a homemade projectile which is also strange ukraine signed the opcw convention at one time organization for the prohibition of chemical weapon yes if it is part of the opcw then even if it is not a factory made munition it is still a violation of the convention there are other thing that bother me this substance could be delivered to them not in the form of a ready made munition but in the form let s say of a packaged chemical substance they pack it there in some artisanal way and then apply it and yet i think it s probably an american munition because other country still behave more cautiously within the framework of the opcw than the american who say and live by the rule what is beneficial to them everything is fine and what is unprofitable mean that it is not good in any case this need to be dealt with because this is not the first message and systematically collect the necessary material analyze them look at the origin because many chemical drug can cause similar manifestation in the form of nausea vomiting tearing and so on however it flashed that there wa still a burn of the respiratory tract it s already therefore in any case now it is necessary to understand and very systematically within the framework of the convention to present these claim because we ll talk we ll discus and we ll forget and here we are again it s not even the first time we ve discussed this tell me that s how protected our warrior are in position they are not yet protected in the sense of having anti incident because their ammunition doe not include even an elementary gas mask because everyone proceeds from the fact that chemical weapon are prohibited for use and even i will give you such a historical analogy hitler when he attacked our country had chemical weapon but he did not use them he used it in the gas chamber but so that on the battlefield such fact for the entire great patriotic war were not recorded i got it so it s time to include gas mask in the ammunition first collect all the data conduct all the necessary analyzes examine people who have been subjected to this and on the basis of this we have chemical and biological protection troop headed by general kirillov and through this system this is their entire task to present and declare including through the chemical weapon convention that ammunition that ha been banned for use since the first world war is used here listen a well dmitry steshin the use of chemical weapon will not bring victory to kiev more since february the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february the armed force of ukraine mercilessly rob the population in the kiev controlled part of the zaporizhzhya region a they understand that they will soon have to flee vladimir rogov

consumes so much ammunition that the u defense department ha to revise it own plan to make sure that everything is done correctly and then it need to be included in the budget because ammunition is expensive well isn t that what your military wanted mr millie andriy marochko a retired lieutenant colonel in the lpr belief that the shortage of spare part and consumables for weapon and equipment of foreign production is growing in the ukrainian army spare part and tool supplied by the west for maintenance and repair of the armed force of ukraine are not enough in all area replenishment is too

zelensky to withdraw troop and prepare for a future counteroffensive however the washington post reported this week that zelensky refuse to do so because he attache symbolic importance to the city and fear a setback to morale should it be surrendered from the very first day of the special operation our army faced large scale battle in urban area and industrial zone this wa neither in syria nor in donbas in military kp ru dmitry steshin directly saw the most epic in battle for mariupol from beginning to end and i tried to figure out what we had learned all the city taken by the army are similar to each other my friend remarked without taking his eye off his binoculars he knew what he wa talking about he had been fighting all his life we sat in some endless ditch on the edge of a giant field in the offensive line of battalion vostok behind the field near the taganrog highway the gas distribution station wa already burning i heard the roar of an orange torch then the block of high rise building began still with glass then the private sector and behind it the industrial zone azovstal somewhere in the sky our copter wa hanging out although even without it it wa clear that the enemy had taken up a defensive position in the city the comrade seems to have spoken to himself those who commanded the storming of grozny who have long been retired will study anew he wa right everything had to be learned i remember how we occupied the district chp and a giant oil mill with deposit of sunflower seed there were hundred of ton of them there they immediately caught fire and smoldered until the middle of summer exuding for kilometer around the smell of childhood behind them are the first city high rise building the vostochny microdistrict they were waiting for u luger s assault group crossed the open space in one throw and swept into the courtyard well under crossfire we managed to pop into the entrance no one knew that the guy had day of fighting in full encirclement ahead one of the fighter of this group a month later will tell me about this siege they supplied u by air quadrocopters paved the tyrolean road on cable in five liter eggplant ammunition food medicine were thrown there were local people in the basement people they were also given medicine in response our guy sent note on piece of wallpaper brother we are doing well we are holding the defense at degree several time the enemy tried to occupy the house of luger he wa a thorn a wedge driven into mariupol finally it wa possible to get a dozen corrected krasnopol shell they extinguished the main firing point of the enemy around the luger house and the azov men banned in the russian federation fled the nazi deliberately did not let people out of mariupol turning them into a human shield i saw these humanitarian corridor that were cracked in ukraine there were shot car corp lying on the asphalt those who managed to jump out and tried to escape on the side of the road lay the tiny body of a child his parent did not want to bury him on the lawn in the city and took him with them on his last journey all the courtyard and square of mariupol turned into cemetery the most unspeakable and terrible thing is when there are people left in the city that is being stormed their people waiting to be released without food water electricity communication sick through and through many are wounded the first local soldier of the vostok battalion were found in one of the high rise building they asked how how did you survive two family and a year old girl arina one of the woman had a bullet wound a sniper shot the bullet went through without hitting vital organ this is very rare the commander of vostok alexander khodakovsky tell these exhausted people we will put a generator in the next entrance we will throw a cable at you there will be electricity arina begin to clap her hand cartoon i ll watch cartoon all the hardest thing in the city were ahead there is a humanitarian catastrophe in the city former city council deputy konstantin ivashchenko told me he will then become the acting mayor of the city i met him outside the hospital where the living lay interspersed with the dead ukrainian authority fled the city on february everything disappeared cleaned up i will never forget the old man who asked me for a sip of water to drink pill i handed him a bottle of mineral water the old man turned back that s a gift i never went to mariupol again without loading the car with water and bread under the roof the new authority began to distribute humanitarian aid in the empty metro hypermarket this place instantly became the center of attraction of the whole city they issued sim card formed team of volunteer opened a medical center and a legal service the city wa revived and restarted and that too had to be learned according to the same scheme severodonetsk and lisichansk were revived the same will have to be done in bakhmut now we know how to bring life back to city it wa the right move to drive the whole pack of defender of the city azov marine vsushniki sbushniki and border guard into the dungeon of azovstal and there they are bombed until they howl how many life of our fighter have been saved i wa at azovstal on the very morning when the azov sapper began to remove their own mine to clear the exit it wa a prisoner of war they were still with gun i wa struck by one detail they were well aware that we were different that they will be fed treated will not be bullied our truck arrived at the place of surrender to take out the wounded they were immediately taken to the hospital of donetsk treated in the same way a our soldier although in the donbas they grumbled because by that time vsushniki and nazi had already begun to post video on the internet with mockery of our prisoner they shot through their knee just finished off the recumbents the whole of ukraine seemed to enjoy these shooting of murder on camera even in the west they whispered worriedly and the vsushniki did thing that would not occur to a normal person they took phone from the dead and called mother and wife joked and had fun even i got it they wrote to my niece take your steshin his dog chew i didn t have a connection for many hour and what the child went through i don t even want to think and he didn t ask but we couldn t discharge the prisoner from the people and behave the same way with them otherwise how are we different from them and whose side is the truth on and the prisoner knew this distinguished between white and black and then on the day of delivery at azovstal they had a good mood and confidence that everything wa over they would live one of the commander of azov with the call sign aspid even showed me a text message from privatbank for a month of sitting at azovstal he received almost thousand ruble i didn t see any remorse in his eye i wa waiting for excess from our gloomy often middle aged men who have been fighting for the last year but the men were silent and in this silence it wa possible to make out the satisfaction done and complete tranquility although there were only of u and machine gun and there are almost of them only one of the fighter shouted something to the azov soldier but they just turned their face to the side i noticed this fighter they will like the fritz restore the city he disagreed something else we will do without their filthy hand the only thing they did not expect from the prisoner of mariupol wa their native heimers which in july will fly to the barrack of the zone in yelenivka and in one fell swoop will destroy seven dozen azov soldier i hope aspid also got this last text message from their independent the last payment for the deed azov is banned in the russian federation recognized a a terrorist organization listen a well will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more in moscow for the first time a meeting of representative of cossack assault

operation before the end of the year more look this is the barmaley you wrote about my friend nodded in the direction of the officer legend the ministry of defense posted a video of his award in the midst of internet battle during which the initiative of individual staff commander to bring the fighter on the front line to the statutory form wa discussed in sharp and not very sharp term someone thought that the beard that are released in the trench interfere with the fulfillment of combat mission so they are subject to total shaving however a small video in which the minister of defense hang the order of alexander nevsky on a bearded major put an end to these battle i also wrote in telegram then saying that if the head of the defense department award an officer with hair on his face then it is politically immature to prohibit it in the combat zone in general in the last week that i spent in the forest of the svatovsky frontier i did not hear a single complaint about forced shaving from bearded men but my friend told me about the same major who turned out to be the commander of the special force detachment sergey bogatyrev the call sign barmaley they say he used to have a longer beard a multiple participant in the horse racing is an internal game of special force from all over the country after winning another competition he wa appointed company commander svo began in chernihiv region where he received his first wound refused long term treatment and rehabilitation and barely getting back on his foot returned to his fighter he participated in the liberation of yampolovka torsky yampol during the crossing of the seversky donets last year with his detachment he came under artillery fire wa wounded again but pulled out the castle company on himself withdrew the entire detachment leaving neither wounded nor those who could be taken prisoner then the battle in toshkovka lisichansk the third wound and again escape from the medical unit to his own company i have there person how will i abandon them after being awarded by the minister he wa on the front line a day later and here he is in front of me on one of the section of the svatovsky frontier an epic hero with a full beard and kind eye even his last name is up to par just got off the front with him and i decided to ask how they become real special force of course he dreamed of becoming a military man since childhood we immediately switch to you the situation disposes when together you fall under millimeter mine you won t believe it but a my mother used to say i still went to the potty played soldier and wanted to become a soldier and this year year old a i wanted to become an officer and so it turned out he studied at suvorovsky then at a military school and became you had an understanding or a premonition that sooner or later you would have to fight for real you probably can t say that but i ll say even more i wanted to the army which periodically doe not conduct military operation is degrading yes there are loss yes problem mistake but the winner is the one who corrects these mistake first you had syria now svo there is a feeling that this is the conflict for which you have prepared yourself yes probably let s be honest this is the biggest conflict after the great patriotic war people who have passed through both afghanistan and chechnya they say this is completely different something that we will always remember how do you motivate yourself let s say you re a teenager if you allow yourself to be offended in the yard you will be crushed until you snap so to speak you don t give a to someone therefore personally i am even glad that such a decision ha been made because well how long could this go on i m explaining it for myself a of february last year an offensive group of the armed force of ukraine wa formed in the donbas and they would crush the donbas i m even sure of it and then on the courage they would go to the crimea and now we would get fighting on the peninsula that is we played ahead of the curve exactly if you know you re going to get punched in the teeth right now hit first whoever strike first that will be the initiative same here everybody understood that now both in kiev and in the west everyone admits that they were just dragging their foot and preparing well prepared how do you as the enemy honestly i respect the enemy really yes they also have problem like everyone else but they were really preparing to fight the russian and unfortunately we probably didn t prepare to fight them at the same time we understand that everything there is not managed by the armed force of ukraine their entire army cadre ha already been knocked out mobilized by all how many prisoner were there we ask well what were you taught in england and he except for they paid le there can not say anything more what can the british teach yes they are cunning i agree everyone is everywhere and always in charge teasing and to fight where they fought there are warrior nation and there are ukrainian are warrior unfortunately yes we are one people no matter what they call themselves i ve met worthy warrior when they fought with the paratrooper when they were already taken prisoner the wounded you ask why didn t you leave yesterday they put so many of you here the answer is simple would you leave and there is nothing to say but a one priest told me god is on our side so we win there are no option my grandmother wa engaged in patriotic education still alive year old and she put me in the diaper that the nazi were enemy i wa waiting for the moment to come when it would be necessary to defend the motherland and now we re doing that not somewhere out there far away but here here it is the russian land russian people are the same here it s just a shame that you often have to fight with the same russian maybe that s why progress is slow some say why wa mobilized and not killed it s a shamble is someone s husband just going to lie down for taking some support why would my wife do that she want him to come back alive therefore the main thing for the commander is to perform the task with the least loss nothing is more precious than human life it must be protected gradually knocking out the enemy how our mobilized behave the tanker from the regiment with whom we interact have really steel ball in their pant straight up handsome in the infantry there are unit where the mobilized are even better than the contractor again the main thing is the presence of platoon company battalion commander if the commander is a normal guy even if he ha never fought before they will be fine read also we are russian soldier if not u then who how the mobilized press the enemy near kremennaya and what they say in the trench military officer kp ru alexander kots transfer from the kremennaya area where mobilized fighter hold the border and press the enemy detail listen also will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more volodymyr zelenskyy gave the th separate mountain assault brigade of the armed force of ukraine the name edelweiss and the corresponding symbolism is a stylized image of a mountain flower well known to u from film about the war this name and emblem were worn in the st mountain infantry division of the third reich by a strange coincidence she fought not only in the north caucasus but also in the donbas she fought in such a way that some of the officer and soldier of edelweiss after the defeat of the third reich landed in the dock in nuremberg for the crime committed and therein lie the first ominous sign the problem of our non brother is that they drag on their banner with the tenacity of madman the disgraced nullified symbol of the thousand year reich which existed for only year wherever you poke at this combination of household magic there will be shame and surrender but our non brother in mind for some reason hope that this will help them win the next crusade to the east won t help to quote a well known demonologist and alchemist the presence of a symbol and it description in a person doe not mean that it is possible to work with the force that this symbol denotes and the description describes it s even more complicated than that disgraced nullified symbol work strictly in the opposite direction they generate from the human will not action and creation but entropy decay decay i saw it with my own eye at azovstal the symbolism of the battalion and then the regiment azov wa a rune called wolf hook the former symbol of the s division da reich this panzer division advanced quite successfully during the blitzkrieg of a part of army group center but six month later something went wrong the division wa frozen and beaten near moscow although it practically stopped in khimki then it wa battered near rzhev so that the remnant had to be taken to france for reformation near prokhorovka on the kursk arc the da reich had to ride on captured equipment it own ran out out of tank were destroyed in the division in after an unsuccessful counteroffensive at lake balaton the division surrendered to the american i wonder what the azov people thought taking symbolism on their banner with such a shameful burden they didn t think anything but they smelled something therefore there were not many azov people who wanted to die under the banner with the wolf hook we sat in the bunker at azovstal munched on poltava stew in glass excellent by the way author when the stew ran out they went out and surrendered at the time of the surrender i wa on the front line in the th corp of azovstal internal staff cartography author i saw the first column of surrendered men coming out this lowered shaking and mentally squeezed herd wa an order of magnitude larger than those who tightened the encirclement ring around azovstal and all of u who were then on the first line experienced terrible anxiety there were many dozen of time more that s just to fight with honor the azov were unable despite the fact that everyone wa wearing equipment and ammunition for hundred of thousand of ruble they counted on purpose fortunately the non brother are completely devoid of learning ability and are not able to build the simplest logical connection edelweiss again began it combat path in ukraine straight into the abyss listen a well will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more alexander you forbid yourself to be called a military officer well a war correspondent is a front line reporter he go for tank he s always in the army yes many guy are now actively working on the frontline calling themselves military officer i respect them in general not a war correspondent sladkov i m a reporter where they will send you recently said that the general battle of the special operation will be the battle for odessa and then it rained down about odessa from kadyrov from someone else why ugledar is not taken from u but we are talking about odessa it s not too early well we re talking about prospect in general i said that maybe maybe and immediately there were message so he said that we would take odessa by monday that s my personal reflection nothing more we just need to somehow resolve the issue of the security of the black sea and to do this you will have to cut off from the sea the territory that is now called ukraine see what they re doing mined already in batumi mine explode launch underwater drone with explosive in order for the black sea fleet to live we need to clear the coast any military company ha it own general battle there were borodino stalingrad odessa in the mental sense in the strategic sense in the military sense is now a very important place do you think we ll just be given it in romania there are elite american unit why are they there is it not so that if we go to odessa we will oppose it and this is already hostility with nato why doe nato need to fight with u they will fight the ukrainian they will squeeze their country to the end and the ukrainian are the heaviest enemy maybe only the german in their highest stage of military development could compare with them american aren t that good anymore the german had an iron discipline many historian say that they are some of the best soldier with whom we have ever had to fight and the ukrainian they have the same approach a we do with the russian maybe the german are technological yes a powerful machine powerful support powerful mind in the headquarters and ukrainian just like u they know how to stand to the last yes you can press the nuclear button the american also offered the french in to press the button a well when a many a french were captured in vietnam the french paused and in japan the american pressed the button and please the war stopped we can do that too but we don t want to by the way norway recorded that our warship began to go on combat duty with tactical nuclear weapon it s a show of strength or weakness well first of all it s learning how to handle this kind of munition and of course a show of force power is never funny power is never pathetic large battalion a napoleon said are always right we have large battalion let them see i am interested in your opinion on the use of chemical weapon by ukraine then they will show a video of the dropping of a shell from a ukrainian drone with some crap that poisoning of the chechen general alautdinov what do you say one sentence these one can why we once took a look at what wa in the phone of the deceased ukrainian soldier there wa a video of them opening grenade from rpg and additionally stuffing them with ball well what s it called but yak i hate them is called they have everything going on if there is a nuclear bomb they will drop it i don t doubt it at all the people who participate in the svo our military how do they feel about the fact that now the west will give ukraine new tank there are fear about this or not we acquire a familiar opponent for u i have been in the army for year for year we have been learning to fight with these model of equipment we studied them a a likely enemy and now let s meet nato tank live well the motivation is to see how much bonus money our businessmen immediately announce for such knocked out tank they even joke that the ukrainian themselves will blow up these tank and we will send them money for it listen a well will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more employee of the

to destroy these leopard and will learn how to burn them prigozhin also spoke about why kiev is so insistent on holding on to artyomovsk he told rt there are three main reason the first reason

the morning wa promising the sky wa covered with pouring cloud which were torn by coarse snow in this weather drone do not fly which mean that it is possible to get to the front edge with minimal risk which i took advantage of going to the trench of a unit consisting of mobilized and volunteer about minute drive along forest road on an armored vehicle tiger then several kilometer on foot along narrow forest belt that cut the field shot through you walk along a well trodden path and when you come to the extreme dugout behind which there is only a field with enemy position on the other bank two tank fly up nearby and begin to aim something a few hundred meter along the front whistling and explosion in the forest belt where i walked just minute ago tank don t pay any attention to the mine well you try to get into the tank with a mortar it should be very lucky the officer standing next to him phlegmatically comment from the height of his three wound the seven two begin to methodically loop behind the field another whistle and the mine explodes a little to the side meter from u the desire to continue shooting at such moment dissipates like black smoke from the hundred and twenty gone into the unfrozen ground we slide together into the dugout which shake slightly from both the close break and the work of the tank in the twilight sit bearded fighter whose age is difficult to determine and because of the vegetation on the face and lack of light there is no statutory gloss fresh clapboard and stretched blanket on the bed instead there are box of shell with mattress and sleeping bag thrown over them minimalism a it is there is not even a stove here so a not to attract enemy thermal imagers only in the corner are trench candle burning and the guy have been living like this for month now at the same time they do not lose either the presence of mind or a sense of humor we just know we re here until the melt until the snow melt off jarg all the boy know this and everyone is ready for it explains the most experienced with the call sign old man we pa the time for dugout conversation how are you with the salary with the equipment i include a member of the

operator ed draw the same bird copter ed see she will not run for one she saw a crowd accordingly the testicle will be thrown there how long doe it take from the moment you see it to the blow you just saw it how much time ha passed and arrived well a maximum of minute they saw you drew eye from there from the north here s the result guy and your mood is like that we re in the mood we are invincible we are russian soldier if not u then who more precisely we have a different motto if no one it s u the enemy by the way with the rotation of people on the front the work is set differently they do not sit there in one place for more than two day on almost every defensive midfielder the personnel is changed every two day so that they do not have time to be frightened if they are lucky enough to survive and judging by the radio intercept the luck on the other side is not very good artillery and tank attack disable dozen of people on the svatovsky frontier every day at the same time our tank have learned to work not only with direct fire but also from closed position a canopy it turn out to be actually a sniper artillery piece which can also be used from a relatively safe distance after saying goodbye to the guy we overcome the way back with a clumsy jog in the shower a little bit of a twist i came and went and the guy live in such condition for month and they hold the defense or even go forward among the stormtroopers there are already real rex which sometimes act better than the personnel contractor yes take the same tank crew flame which before my eye dismantled the support

biggest tactical gain for the deeply troubled russian invasion since july but ukraine s military said it still held the besieged eastern city though the one remaining major road it can use to deliver troop and supply or evacuate the wounded wa under russian fire bakhmut is the epicenter of the enemy s attack and therefore the situation is critical col serhiy cherevaty the spokesman for ukraine s eastern military command said in an interview on monday he said that ukrainian troop had repelled assault on bakhmut over the previous hour but that no watershed moment had been reached the city he said is under ukrainian control bakhmut lie at the heart of a brutal monthslong battle after leveling much of the city with artillery the russian now appear to have surrounded it on three side and to have captured several town and village around it ukraine s military said on monday that street fighting had also begun in two of bakhmut s neighborhood for month volunteer from ukraine and abroad had taken extraordinary risk to evacuate civilian and provide medical care in bakhmut operating three heating and aid shelter in a city that ha mostly lacked electricity or heat pete reed an american volunteer medic wa killed in bakhmut this month the presence of aid worker in this crucible of violence despite the grave risk had helped reassure the remaining resident that ukraine had not abandoned them we are fighting for people s heart one volunteer mykhailo puryshev said in a telephone interview he estimated that to civilian were still in bakhmut including child the kremlin ha focused on bakhmut which had a prewar population of about and where several highway and rail line converge a pivotal to president vladimir v putin s stated goal of conquering donbas the vital industrial and mining region that make up easternmost ukraine russia ha poured enormous number of troop into trying to conquer it driving conscript into near suicidal assault in a bid to overwhelm ukrainian defensive line the city now lie in ruin and the vast majority of it people have long fled but ukrainian have made bakhmut a symbol of tenacious resistance and a rallying cry and president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine ha rejected talk of giving it up ukrainian force have also used russia s relentless wave of attack a an opportunity to inflict thousand of casualty the result military analyst say ha been slaughter out of proportion to the city s strategic importance u s official estimate that russia ha seen nearly fighter killed or wounded since it invaded almost a year ago a staggering loss swelled by the battle for bakhmut but the kremlin undaunted drafted about men last fall and sent many of them to the donbas in july the industrial city of lysychansk on a rise overlooking the siversky

prevent the russian from advancing on the larger city of kramatorsk and slovyansk in an assessment of the battlefield on monday rochan consulting an analytical group based in poland noted that russia had encroached on bakhmut from the north and the south in recent day and said the city could fall a soon a this week a russian radio broadcast in the city predict it imminent fall many people sit in basement and are afraid to go out or let their child out even to be evacuated said mr puryshev the aid volunteer speaking in a video address posted online a ukrainian commander who go by the nickname madyar said the ban on aid worker and group entering bakhmut wa necessary because the fighting now expose to danger even volunteer who come here with good intention to help the ukrainian army will now provide aid to those who need it he said bakhmut wa is and remains ukrainian he said the decision suggests that the ukrainian military cannot secure even area in the city that for month had been considered relatively safe such a neighborhood on the western bank of the bakhmutka river that are farther from russian artillery russia s ministry of defense said on monday that it force had taken the village of krasna hora on the northern edge of bakhmut the statement posted on the telegram messaging app came a day after the wagner private military company whose force have helped lead russia s campaign to seize bakhmut said that it assault unit had taken the village bakhmut ha been under russian bombardment since last spring but the fighting there ha intensified since the fall with the russian firing thousand of artillery shell per day wagner recruited mercenary from among russian inmate with the promise of pardon using them on the front line in bakhmut where they have suffered heavy casualty moscow s force fought their way town by town street by street house by house toward the city breaching multiple line of defense now they are sending small unit that slip into the city said colonel cherevaty the ukrainian military spokesman lviv ukraine creeping forward along a tree line late at night toward an entrenched ukrainian position the russian soldier watched in horror a his comrade were mowed down by enemy fire his squad of ex convict advanced only a few dozen yard before being decimated we were hit by machine gun fire said the soldier a private named sergei one soldier wa wounded and screamed help me help me please the private said though no help arrived eight soldier were killed one escaped back to russian line and sergei wa captured by ukrainian the soldier were sitting duck sent forth by russian commander to act essentially a human cannon fodder in an assault and they have become an integral component of russia s military strategy a it xa press a new offensive in ukraine s east relying on overwhelming manpower much of it comprising inexperienced poorly trained conscript regardless of the high rate of casualty there are two main u of the conscript in these assault a storm troop who move in wave followed by more experienced russian fighter and a intentional target to draw fire and thus identify ukrainian position to hit with artillery in interview last week half a dozen prisoner of war provided rare firsthand account of what it is like to be part of xa a sacrificial russian assault these order were common so our loss were gigantic sergei said the next group would follow after a pause of or minute then another then another of his combat experience he said it wa the first and last wave for me by luck the bullet missed him he said he lay in the dark until he wa captured by ukrainian who slipped into the buffer area between the two trench line the new york time interviewed the russian at a detention center near lviv in ukraine s west where many captured enemy soldier are sent from there some are returned to russia in prisoner exchange the time also viewed video of interrogation by the ukrainian authority the prisoner are identified only by first name and rank for security reason because of the possibility of retribution once they are returned though they are prisoner of war overseen by ukrainian the russian said they spoke freely their account could not be independently corroborated but conformed with assessment of the fighting around the eastern ukrainian city of bakhmut by western government and military analyst the soldier in sergei s squad were recruited from penal colony by the private military company known a wagner whose force have mostly been deployed in the bakhmut area there they have enabled russian line to move forward slowly cutting key resupply road for the ukrainian army russia s deployment of former convict is a dark chapter in a vicious war russia behind bar a prison right group ha estimated that a many a russian prisoner have been recruited since last summer with most sent to the battle for bakhmut in the early phase of xa the xa war the russian army had copious armored vehicle artillery and other heavy weaponry but relatively few soldier on the battlefield now the table have turned russia ha deployed about soldier in ukraine according to ukraine s military intelligence agency an additional are in training camp official said meaning there is the potential for half a million soldier to join the offensive but using infantry to storm trench redolent of world war i brings high casualty so far the tactic ha been used primarily by wagner in the push for bakhmut last week the head of wagner yevgeny v prigozhin said he would end the practice of recruiting convict but russia s regular army this month began recruiting convict in exchange for pardon shifting the practice on the russian side in the war from the wagner private army to the military some military analyst and western government have questioned russia s strategy xa citing rate of wounded and killed at around percent in battalion featuring former convict on sunday the british defense intelligence agency xa said xa that over the past two week russia had probably suffered it highest rate of casualty since the first week of the invasion interview with former wagner soldier at the ukrainian detention center aligned with these description of the fighting and shed light on a violent harrowing experience for russian soldier nobody could ever believe such a thing could exist sergei said of wagner tactic sergei sat shoulder slumped on the sofa in the warden s office of the ukrainian detention center he wa balding and wore shoe without lace the soldier arrived at the front straight from russia s penal colony system which is rife with abuse and where obedience to harsh code of conduct in a violent setting is enforced by prison gang and guard alike the same sense of beaten subjugation persists at the front sergei said enabling commander to send soldier forward on hopeless human wave attack we are prisoner even if former prisoner he said we are nobody and have no right sergei said he had worked a a cellphone xa tower technician in a far northern siberian city living with his wife and three child in the interview he admitted to dealing marijuana and meth for which he wa sentenced to year in prison in in october he accepted an offer to fight in exchange for a pardon the arrangement he said wa not offered to rapist and drug addict but murderer burglar and other prisoner were welcome of course any normal person fear death he said but a pardon for eight year is valuable the fighting would turn out to be far more dangerous than he had imagined in three day at the front south of bakhmut private sergei first served a a stretcher bearer carrying out mangled bloody former prisoner who had been killed or wounded in an omen of what awaited him when ordered to join an assault xa on the night of jan they were commanded to advance yard along the tree line then dig in and wait for a subsequent wave to arrive one soldier carried a light machine gun the others were armed with only assault rifle and hand grenade the sequential assault on ukrainian line by small unit of former russian prisoner have become a signature russian tactic in the effort to capture bakhmut we see them crawl for a kilometer or more toward ukrainian trench then open fire at close range and try to capture position col roman kostenko the chairman of the defense and intelligence committee in ukraine s parliament said in an interview it s effective yes they have heavy loss but with these heavy loss they sometimes advance it could be colonel kostenko said that such infantry assault on entrenched defense will remain mostly confined to the fight for bakhmut and that they are being used to conserve tank and armored personnel carrier for the expected offensive but they could also serve a a template for wider fighting the former convict colonel kostenko said are herded into the battlefield by harsh discipline they have order and they cannot disobey order especially in wagner a private named aleksandr who shaved three year off a sentence for illegal logging by enlisting with wagner said that before deploying to the front he wa told he would be shot if he disobeyed order to advance they brought u to a basement divided u into five person group and though we hadn t been trained told u to run ahead a far a we could go he said of his commander his dash toward ukrainian line in a group of five soldier ended with three dead and two captured another captured russian eduard enlisted to get four year cut from a sentence for car theft he spent three month at the front a a stretcher bearer before being ordered forward he wa captured on his first human wave assault from his time a a stretcher bearer he said he estimated that half of the men in each assault were wounded or killed with shrapnel and bullet wound the most common injury private sergei said he had initially been pleased with the offer of a pardon in exchange for service in wagner when i came to this war i thought it wa worth it he said but after his one experience in an assault he changed his mind i started to think thing over in a big way he said of course it wasn t worth it since february the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february retired lieutenant colonel of the lpr andrei marochko said that the russian armed force began to use new tactic on the contact line a well a occupy more profitable border now the command ha a new tactic and strategy time have changed the mean of destruction and observation have changed the lieutenant colonel said soldier of the first slavic brigade struck a hangar with ukrainian tank near donetsk the military facility of the armed force of ukraine wa destroyed by the first salvo from the grad installation the ministry of defense of the russian federation said that russian troop liberated the village of krasnaya gora located in the dpr the department noted that the loss of ukrainian troop per day exceeded military the ministry of defense of russia reported that in the kupyansk and krasnolimansky direction the armed force of ukraine lost more than soldier killed during the day the first logical question is what is bakhmut artemovsk here it turn out that everything is interconnected back in early summer when there wa fighting in the ugledar direction i heard this opinion from the fighting officer if only we did not have to storm slavyansk and kramatorsk head on we would get bogged down in fact with the fall of bakhmut the enemy in the donbas will have the last defensive node the so called slavic kramatorsk agglomeration a long intestine of city town and industrial zone running in an arc from north to south at this natural defensive line there were a they say in ukraine fortification fortress in the pre field soledar bakhmut and many adjacent village turned into defensive node these village for the most part have already been taken soledar fell the capture of bakhmut is a matter of the near future according to report from local resident and official statement by the ukrainian authority since monday civilian who do not live in the city volunteer and journalist have been denied access to bakhmut and all the road leading to bakhmut are either cut or shot through there is no reason not to believe the local a recently a last week wagnerian fighter storming bakhmut from the north confirmed to the kp military commander that the enemy s artillery activity ha noticeably decreased and the last foreign journalist who visited the city from the british bbc in their report noted that the armed force of ukraine began to experience a shortage of ammunition even for small arm the moment for the enemy is unpleasant especially when the fighting began in the urban area under the circumstance we can wait for the enemy to begin to withdraw to more reliable line that is to the slavyansko kramatorsk agglomeration but there he ha an unpleasant surprise prepared for him everyone remembers the sad history of the french defensive maginot line which the german wehrmacht simply bypassed did not hammer concrete fortification head on this story hide the whole problem of such defensive line they can be circumvented they are not intended for circular defense even fortress created to fight in full encirclement always have weak spot where the wall are lower the palisade is rotten the fighter are cowardly and untrained what can we say about the kilometer intestine of the armed force of ukraine accustomed to fighting only on one side on the eastern kiev military and politician have repeatedly stated that kramatorsk and slavyansk will become unbreakable stronghold on which the moskal horde will break of course if the moskal horde begin to storm them head on from the east for a number of reason we won t do that the first sign is a sharp intensification of fighting at kremennaya hanging over slavyansk from the north and the second sign is the beginning of the assault on ugledar it doe not go easily and not everything smoothly but no one ha backed down in this town our chance to go from the south to the rear of the slavyansko kramatorskaya group of the armed force of ukraine because behind ugledar there are no powerful ukrainian defensive node there are no big city field and a sparse grid of road are nothing for the enemy to cling to the second option is an intermediate result to half or completely encircle the grouping of the armed force of ukraine standing near donetsk and digging there for year the whole world know the name of these town and village like avdiivka and marinka from which ukrainian troop have been shelling the capital of the dpr all this time on weekend ours applied the so called product to ugledar the tallest structure of the town is the chp pipe the armed force of ukraine hung on it all possible mean of observation optic thermal imagers night vision device ugledar is already on a hill so from the pipe the enemy in fact controlled all approach to the city and the entire offensive line they tried to destroy the pipe with shell and even hit once but it resisted product carry kg explosive and is launched from a helicopter at a distance of up to kilometer the mean of objective control transmitted a sparse black and white picture see the video on our website kp ru of the product hitting the top of the pipe exactly through the electronic eye and antenna now there is confidence that our ugledar will not be left alone they will take it and move on until the pincer clamp down on the last bandera stronghold in the donbas listen a well dmitry goblin puchkov ukrainian will run out earlier than the weapon supplied by the west more the georgian tv channel rustavi showed sensational footage about meter from the beach in batumi there wa an explosion a sea mine exploded thank god no one wa hurt on the video footage you can clearly see how a black and ragged column of smoke broke out into the sky for meter how did this infection end up at the batumi coast most georgian russian and turkish military specialist agree on one thing this horned death sailed from the odessa coast where the ukrainian were densely covered with similar mine fairway such mine were installed on the so called mine and simply put on cable at a certain depth but during storm mine were torn off the cable and they went on a free voyage throughout the black sea turkey began to ring alarm bell last summer when a black ball filled with kilogram of tnt began to dangle near it shore further ukrainian mine torn off by a storm began to be noticed in the water of bulgaria and romania the bulgarian authority urged resident of the black sea region to be more vigilant because of the danger of blowing up ship on ukrainian sea mine we ask the population in the area of dobrich varna and burgas to be vigilant if suspicious spherical object are detected in the water or on the shore we ask citizen to report the incident to the emergency number and the turkish navy command urged sailor to be more careful when entering the black sea and track drifting mine it is important that all ship in the region establish careful monitoring of drifting mine the detection of mine like object should be reported to the main rescue coordination centre well now here is batumi our naval specialist believe that the current of the black sea were inevitably to drag the ukrainian mine torn from the anchor to the batumi coast and this is a threat not only to the beach but also to shipping in that region and even more the appearance of these walking mine is not excluded in the end in the mediterranean sea georgian and turkish newspaper are already howling the threat that ha arisen is the result of negligent and absolutely rash activity of the armed force of ukraine i asked the specialist in naval mine captain i rank vladimir orlov what trouble can bring people ship or warship of this type horned death here s what he said actually the batumi people were very lucky if it happened on a warm day on the beach there could be up to a hundred corp well the steamer or barge would instantly go to the bottom the horn of this mine are lead cup inside of which there are glass ampoule with sulfuric acid upon contact with the hull of the ship the lead crumpled the ampoule broke the acid leaked out and became an electrolyte in the galvanic cell well the resulting electric current activated the detonator and ba bah listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more ascent artillery working the twilight of the dugout is setting in motion the soldier of the cannon division of the nd army corp silently dress in their shabby ammunition and take turn going out to god s light the sun s ray are just beginning to break through the trunk of ship s pine there is virgin white snow all around with no fresh car footprint or other sign of human presence from above the camp can not be seen pipe from the bourgeois sticking out of the ground are hardly visible from a drone in the middle of a green forest st century and nothing better than dugout in the more often fortification science did not invent except for the concrete basement but there aren t enough of them for everyone yes we are also not bad here the commander of the crew volodya cheeres up in the morning frost forest tale a dugout of three roll sand on top a direct hit of a shell of millimeter may not stand but it s still try to find u to hit is a nato caliber and they don t have any soviet left they rarely come the dugout is really solid with two exit in case one of them is overwhelmed by a close explosion it feel like it s done wisely the guy are working with mm hyacinth gun and this is not a weapon that quickly change position you have to work from one place and live nearby i asked about the nato caliber for a reason why are there more and more destroyed western equipment in combat report now yes because kiev ha le and le of it own so all sort of caesar french self propelled howitzer ed and three ax american towed howitzer ed become a routine of daily statistic although they work a a rule nomadic tool do not stand in one place move and under the cover of their fire small maneuver group of the enemy are trying to wedge themselves into our defensive formation and this happens along the entire line of the svatovsky border a well a in the direction of lisichansk but the way it turned out for them last year in the kharkiv region it doe not work here now the armed force of ukraine are stuck in the position that are now held by the mobilized and even catch the enemy on counterattack moving slowly forward guy call for breakfast a mini log cabin lined with pawpaw two entrance again a sign place of eating occasional checker like that even in the forest everything wa according to the charter for example i came across a poster stuck to a tree in the forest about the danger of alcohol drug and promiscuous sexual relation which can easily turn into not only not the most heroic death but even treason both to the wife and the motherland often have to settle down like this i go to the makeshift dining room where hot tea is already poured well a we change position we immediately settle down the young gunner shrug their shoulder what a move is already on the account and you can t count dozen of time since the beginning of the operation and each time you have to dig a new one yes it s all over again cellar crack shelter say volodya all for comfort well security of course when we arrive at a new position the first thing to do is immediately slit shelter and for ammunition so that they were below ground level so that in the event of arrival fragment do not hurt and there is no rupture well then we gradually start for ourselves so that there is somewhere to live covered happened year old volodya ha been fighting for the second year and he volunteered friend went and he what s worse sam from luhansk region he worked for four year a a mechanic in a factory and decided to radically change his life it s already a habit he smile you come home you sit in the dismissal for a couple of day it s somehow not the same pull back on the couch it happens you sleep on a soft one you do not get enough sleep but here on the drawer with a mattress another thing or even maybe just a sleeping bag when you get used to everything quickly it depends i think on the person some still can t get used to it and those who quickly in a day in two new people come instantly stabilize somehow settle down but i still want to quickly take my territory so that everything settle down parent look at your new job it seems to me that any mother and father would not want their son to fight somewhere the artillery battery work in direct

to come back here masha everything will be fine sasha say on camera having shot back the crew again camouflage the gun wrapping in a pine pawn and disperses to their forest affair and i go further along the svatovsky line on which the russian troop still managed to stabilize the line of combat contact and even seize the initiative read also when will we start attacking and we re already doing

starting there are serious problem with ammunition shortage and other kit which is partly due to underspending but also because of the amount of ammo and other ordnance we are supplying to ukraine an unnamed source at the ministry of defence told the newspaper our force are also stretched because of the extent to which they are training ukrainian force the uk is the largest supplier of military aid to ukraine after the united state with london committing billion billion to kiev s force last year britain ha trained around ukrainian soldier and plan to train another plus pilot this year

forced to abandon most of the weapon special operation in ukraine the broadcast is updated the soldier knelt in the snow aimed a rocket launcher and fired in the direction of russian troop positioned about a mile away he wa set up at a ukrainian firing position and looked just like the other ukrainian troop fighting south of the city of bakhmut in one of the most brutal theater of the war but he and his comrade are not ukrainian they are soldier in a ukrainian military unit made up entirely of russian who are fighting and killing their own countryman they have taken up arm against russia for a variety of reason a sense of moral outrage at their country s invasion a desire to defend their adopted homeland of ukraine or because of a visceral dislike of xa russia s president vladimir v putin and they have earned enough trust from ukrainian commander to take their place among the force viciously fighting the russian military a real russian man doesn t engage in such an aggressive war won t rape child kill woman and elderly people said one russian fighter with the military call sign caesar ticking off atrocity committed by russian soldier that motivated him to leave his native st petersburg and fight for ukraine that s why i don t have remorse i do my job and i ve killed a lot of them nearly a year into the war the free russia legion a the unit is called ha received little attention in part to protect the soldier from reprisal by russia but also because of reluctance within the ukrainian military to highlight the effort of soldier whose home country ha done so much harm to ukraine several hundred of them are concentrated in the area around bakhmut in eastern ukraine official said they are always grouped with their own but are overseen by ukrainian officer in interview some russian soldier said they were already living in ukraine when russian force invaded last year and felt an obligation to defend their adopted country others often with no military experience crossed into ukraine from russia after the war began moved by a sense that the kremlin s invasion wa profoundly unjust we haven t come here to prove anything said one soldier with the call sign zaza we ve come here to help ukraine achieve the full withdrawal of russian force from ukrainian territory and the future de putinization of russia fearing retaliation against relative and themselves none of the soldier interviewed agreed to be identified by name or to provide specific detail about their biography last week the russian prosecutor general s office filed a suit with the country s supreme court to have the legion declared a terrorist organization zaza a skinny blond who look barely out of high school would not even give his age saying only that he wa under after russian force invaded he said he could not keep his mouth shut his outspokenness and antiwar post on social medium got him in trouble with his university s administration then with the police when officer from russia s security service showed up at his front door in the fall he said he decided it wa time to leave he said he walked across the border into ukraine and signed up to fight at such a young age it is a little early for me to talk about my political opinion and worldview because these are just forming now he said but when your country ha been taken over by one bad man you need to take thing into your own hand xa at the start of the war ukrainian law prevented russian citizen from joining the armed force it took until august to finalize legislation that would allow the legion to legally join the fight andriy yusov a spokesman for ukraine s military intelligence service said in a statement there wa a large number of russian who because of their moral principle could not remain indifferent and were searching for a way to enter the rank of the defender of ukraine mr yusov said explaining the military s motivation to create the unit all legionnaire have come with a huge desire to stop putin s horde and free russia from dictatorship the group operates under the umbrella of ukraine s international legion a fighting force that includes unit made up of american and british volunteer a well a belarusian georgian and others it is not easy to join russian soldier said they have to submit an application and undergo an extensive background check that includes polygraph test only then can they enter basic training a russian passport holder they are inevitably met with distrust there have been several attempt by russian spy to infiltrate the legion mr yusov said in a pine forest in the kyiv region last week a group of new russian recruit nearing the end of a three month basic training course practiced tactical retreat firing mortar and basic combat medicine they exemplified the international hodgepodge that ha come to define much of ukraine s war effort russian soldier trained on a french made millimeter mortar and carried american made m rifle it s better than a kalashnikov one of the soldier said of the m i ve fired about round and haven t had any problem yet the sound of small arm fire and heavy artillery echoed through the forest and an instructor threw a dummy grenade near a small group of soldier to gauge how they would react most of the soldier will occupy position back from the front line working in artillery or air reconnaissance unit using drone though the instructor were all ukrainian all spoke in russian in interview some of the recruit tried to speak a few word of ukrainian but quickly switched back to their native language after about one or two month a they ve settled in they start to use small phrase like thank you or fire said one of the instructor who declined to provide his name the soldier said they struggled to explain their decision to family back in russia report of atrocity committed by russian troop including the butchering of civilian in the kyiv suburb of bucha and irpin are dismissed a foreign propaganda in their homeland they don t understand the whole truth said a year old soldier with the call sign miami who said his parent had urged him to fight on the russian side they re told that bad people live here and they believe it they don t believe that the second biggest army in the world could kill regular people back at the front in eastern ukraine the shelling never stop

in a dugout in a neighborhood of small snow covered cottage soldier in the legion said that they were continuing to hold the line but some have already begun to think beyond the immediate battle and even beyond the war in ukraine to what come next my task is not just to protect the people of ukraine said caesar if i remain alive after this phase and all ukrainian territory is liberated i will absolutely continue fighting with a weapon in my hand to overthrow this kremlin regime caesar who ha earned a reputation a a kind of eccentric sage within the legion said he wa an avowed russian nationalist yet he nonetheless belief that modern russia ha gone off the rail particularly when it come to invading ukraine he said he wa once a member of the russian imperial movement which the united state ha declared a violent extremist group but said he broke with it in part over it support for russia s annexation of the crimean peninsula in a senior ukrainian military official involved with overseeing the legion said that caesar had spent a long time searching for a path he felt wa ideologically correct adding that ukrainian official had found no reason to distrust him caesar who moved his wife and four child to ukraine over the summer said he did not believe he wa fighting against fellow russian but scoundrel and murderer who have no nationality i m sitting before you an

ukraine to drive the leopard next week it will be held at a military training ground in the lower saxon city of munster listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more russian explorer yerofey khabarov would be happy he knew how to annex land to russia writes the governor of the khabarovsk territory mikhail degtyarev about the first sample of the light tactical all terrain vehicle of high cross country ability buggy erofey which is being tested at the training ground of the eastern military district of russia in the khabarovsk territory where it wa assembled erofeya ha already been tested by the presidential envoy to the far east yuri trutnev who is a master of sport and bronze medalist of the russian rally championship and acting commander of

from the drone khabarovsk vezdekhod received a certificate of conformity of the eurasian economic union and after the cvo will not lose relevance it will be in demand among the forest guard unit of the ministry of emergency situation and the border service listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more ukrainization ha triumphantly reached odessa where it continues to this day or rather until odessa a it is now called by the maydowns who won in ukraine since it wa odessa wa a pearl by the sea and odesa is increasingly sliding to the level of a farm on the site of khadzhibeyevka where the victorious selyuks dictate their will to the population they with cackling and gnawing demolished the monument to catherine ii and her associate and now they have reached the bread or rather to khlib until recently among odessans pardon odesa resident in addition to the traditional palyanytsi the baton potemkinsky wa also popular but that s a mess the figure of potemkin who wa in the same sculptural composition suffered the same fate and the khlib remained untouched mess decided the nezalezhniki and quickly renamed the loaf potemkinsky in the same loaf but now with a new name hetmansky the recipe according to rumor remained the same but if these selyuks thought that in this way they solved the problem then it is probably worth disappointing them after all grigory alexandrovich potemkin wa not only the first commander in chief of the black sea fleet and it creator field marshal general and serene prince governor general of the novorossiysk territory but also drum roll he wa the great hetman of the ekaterinoslav and black sea cossack troop adding this title to the rest in that is it turned out that the hetman is not opposed to the potemkinsky but only complement it with some nuance it should have been called presidential or ataman for example potemkin wa neither but how much more work is to be done by odessa baker and local authority even just to imagine this amount of work is difficult after all ahead is the renaming of the baton dyukovsky named so in honor of the associate of the empress governor general of novorossiya and bessarabia armand emmanuel du plessis richelieu who in common parlance received the nickname luke in pre revolutionary odessa not in pre maidan but in pre revolutionary until what about the vorontsovsky loaf what kind of future doe he have if his serene highness prince mikhail semenovich vorontsov is not just the governor general of the same land but also a field marshal general adjutant general chamberlain and even the commander of the russian occupation corp in france that is an obvious anti euphoria and there is also a lanzheronovsky loaf and everyone know that it is named not in honor of the seaside part of odessa but in honor of the hero of the war with napoleon the most former french emigrant he fled from the then european union that s what general of the infantry of the russian army count alexander fedorovich langeron by the way he is also the governor general of novorossiya and bessarabia and this is the same part of the city of odessa named in his honor it is absolutely impossible to have any doublethink here since portrait of all these historical figure are printed on the bag of bread that is the work ahead is an unfinished end even if the bread itself disappears they still will not stop doing their fascinating work and if we consider that the monument to vorontsov and duke are still intact then in general and if langeron is renamed will the odesa people have enough strength odessans would have had enough but they would not have engaged in such nonsense p s how harmoniously against the background of these and other news from ukraine look the news that ukraine ha withdrawn from the ci agreement on the treatment of psychiatric disorder listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february the office of the united nation high commissioner for human right ohchr confirmed the authenticity of the video with the shooting of russian prisoner of war by soldier of the armed force of ukraine which appeared recently on the internet and expressed concern to the ukrainian ministry of defense the russian military ha entrenched itself in the northern part of artemovsk in the dpr three of the four supply route for ukrainian troop have been cut said denis pushilin acting head of the dpr the acting head of the dpr denis pushilin said that the evacuation of civilian to volnovakha which is under russian control ha begun from ugledar according to him there are about civilian in ugledar part of the russian force ha already been evacuated in the armed force of ukraine there is almost no ammunition left said the deputy head of the office of the ukrainian president igor zhovkva russian troop took control of the village of dvurechne in the kharkiv region the settlement wa occupied by unit of the western grouping of troop of the armed force of the russian federation russian troop repelled the landing of saboteur of the armed force of ukraine on the left bank of the dnieper the sabotage group wa destroyed by fire from rifle gun russian aviation shot down the ukrainian mi in the zaporozhye region the helicopter of the armed force of ukraine wa shot down in the area of ternovka it took specialist only a day to identify the killer he got into the frame and not by chance he posed satisfied with himself this video shot on a phone flew around the entire network and then got on federal channel and even became the reason for russia s appeal to the un they used to wash something back captured russian soldier lying on the ground are shot to nazi scream moreover there were several shooting a well a video on only one part of the face of the killer but on the second shooting he decided to pose with the corp of the victim found it quickly his name is sergey makarenko he life in zhytomyr region in the village of krasnobirka this is not the first execution of our prisoner there is only one reason why such act are committed the feeling of complete impunity and invulnerability there is no doubt that if this bastard survives he will still be caught even in a dozen year but our fighter are being killed right now and here in my opinion there is one way out asymmetrical it is necessary to break the illusion of invulnerability of war criminal right now tomorrow and it is probably easier to do this to put kalibr or any other product simpler directly into the garden on this street in the village of krasnobirka it is only necessary to honestly explain for what why and thanks to whom the inhabitant of this village experienced unpleasant moment i have no doubt that even in donetsk i will hear the cowardly howl of the zahistas of nezalezhnaya za shcho you know perfectly well why listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more on the air of radio komsomolskaya pravda ivan pankin and igor vittel discussed with military expert retired colonel anatoly matviychuk publication in the western medium about russia s large scale offensive on nezalezhnaya and the consequence for people and territory in the svo zone talk of a big offensive is premature the logic of the event on the special operation is such that the defense cannot achieve victory we are demilitarizing ukraine so the offensive will happen and they re in a panic a it sound look at the front from right to left or from south to north soledar artemovsk below we descend ugledar and above they went to kharkov everywhere the activation of the front the front ha leveled off we pushed the nazi force to a depth of to kilometer the shelling of donetsk ha decreased we pushed back their firing position the front is about to crack and it will crack yes and we will go on the offensive and they are now rushing around and trying to explain that the damned russian are now pouring into this ukraine with all their might because give kiev tank missile plane this is the logic of the western information mainstream yes and after all the west will eventually give these long range missile including atacms however the quantity that they supply is unlikely to go into quality but it will create additional difficulty for u creates this is our overconsumption of ammunition and the most terrible thing is the loss of our people a for the atacms missile expensive stuff and how many will the state put them up well let there be such missile and kiev will immediately make launch say on object in the crimea they will be shot down the rocket will quickly run out for kiev something else is important here the transfer of hostility to the territory of russia see the west how can we of course they can but where will europe find fighter for zelensky none of the eu country ha stated directly what the fighter will give they talk about tank ammunition mlrs all this work for the average european how do you see the coming offensive kiev will not be taken yet but the front near ugledar and artyomovsk will soon crack this hole will form and leakage will begin the main task we have now is what direction to kramatorsk this is the center of the southern grouping with the fall of kramatorsk the operational stability of this defensive area decrease that will allow u to maneuver directing the blow wherever we want but the main blow i think will go to nikolaev why there we will level the front seize the road that will ensure the logistics of our troop and cut off the logistics of the ukrainian troop and the direction to odessa will be fixed cut off access to the sea and having reached the line odessa nikolaev and there god willing and to kharkov we will be able to dictate our term later kiev will fall now on the border in romania huge nato group are concentrated yes there is the st u s airborne division screaming eagle there wa not a single war in which they did not participate but if they launch an offensive in bessarabia and try to cut u off from odessa they will fall under the blow of our aerospace force and screaming eagle don t work without aviation but if they move nato aircraft there gentleman here s a black mark for you we re starting a war and if not get out to the mother from here so odessa should be in our mind i would very much not like odessa to be stormed my friend from odessa write that they were pressed there terribly they are afraid to go out on the street to use the phone they go to the address check it is already worse than during the nazi occupation but odessans when we get there i think they will help u what western supply are you particularly afraid of i really don t want long range missile why there is evidence that the west is trying to dump radioactive waste on ukraine ukraine is ready to bury them in the ground for a pittance but who will guarantee that they will not shove it all into the same atacms but these are not nuclear weapon well the rocket fell broke and all this content splashed over the territory and radioactive contamination of the area began for long from to year this territory will be unsuitable for agricultural work people will not be able to live there river and lake fish and other living creature will suffer a for zelensky s admission of unwillingness to comply with the minsk agreement zelensky needed the entire territory of ukraine they needed the east of the country it clearly smacked of the croatian scenario to wait accumulate strength and then destroy listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more the un office of the high commissioner for human right ohchr is aware of recently emerged footage apparently showing the execution of russian soldier who had surrendered by ukrainian troop a spokeswoman for the un watchdog marta hurtado ha said we have raised concern about the treatment of prisoner of war including alleged killing of pow by the ukrainian armed force with ukraine s ministry of defense hurtado told ta in a statement on friday the graphic video in question surfaced earlier this week filmed by an armed individual speaking ukrainian and demanding answer from three men in military uniform lying on the ground after failing to elicit a coherent response from them the man shoot one of the men in the head multiple time at point blank range one of the men lying motionless on the ground also ha visible blood around his head apparently getting shot and killed before the video started a fellow ukrainian soldier appeared to try to reason with the gunman pointing out that the third captive wa holding a grenade the killer briefly showed his face at the very end of the video concluding it with an obscenity and glory to ukraine slogan which is commonly associated with world war ii era nazi collaborator but is widely used in present day ukraine read more russia to probe alleged pow execution by ukrainian nationalist additional footage seemingly filmed in the immediate aftermath of the incident showed the killer trying to provide excuse to justify his action the un is aware of this footage a well hurtado said adding that none of the excuse actually have merit we are also aware of another video that ha appeared on social medium platform that includes additional footage of the original incident and also appears to show a ukrainian soldier confessing to the killing and trying to justify it by alleging that the victim refused to surrender or that they were part of the wagner group military and security contractor fighting on behalf of the russian federation the spokeswoman said these excuse do not provide justification for the soldier s action under international humanitarian law according to the russian defense ministry the killing of unarmed soldier who surrendered is a widespread practice by kiev s troop and multiple incident of this sort have occurred amid the ongoing conflict with some of them published online by the killer themselves the russian investigative committee said on thursday that the footage appeared to show the recent murder of three russian pow by ukrainian nationalist pledging to investigate further and identify the perpetrator not according to yurka ignat the cap of arestovich it wa a former adviser to zelensky s office who could calmly rub in that the russian had missile very soon running out it remains to endure two or three week and he wa believed in ukraine although none of the propagandist s prediction came true but official representative of various ukrainian law enforcement agency it seems cannot say a word on this topic so a not to be embarrassed publicly in front of the amazed public literally during the speech a the already mentioned speaker of the air force of ukraine yuriy ignat or the representative of the main intelligence directorate gur andriy yusov the first said that the force of anti corruption defense air defense of independence managed to shoot down five of the seven attack drone launched by russia against target in ukraine but the second one explained right on the air of the all ukrainian telethon that the attempt of moscow s missile blitzkrieg failed that is it absolutely failed the missile blitzkrieg ha already lost it meaning because the ukrainian energy system ha survived despite the huge loss the terrorist country is rapidly reducing the number of high precision missile weapon and there is no way to replenish stock in proper quantity so the intensity and break between attack have changed yusov explained to ukrainian viewer stunned by the power of russian missile strike and the accuracy of arrival in ukraine today it is no longer a battle between the tv and the refrigerator but the battle of reality with television powerful russian reparation have arrived at military and critical infrastructure facility in almost all major city of ukraine today no surrender the head of the ukrainian regional administration panicked in their official and unofficial account in social network message missile are flying bulge in the city explosion are heard there is a second wave a launch from the black sea from the carrier of kalibr rusnya raised strategist meaning tu bomber capable of carrying both conventional cruise missile and the so called special ammunition again the well known song about the fact that the russian hit ukrainian city with s missile rushed the ukrainian command always launch this mulk to justify the blunder of it air defense and the arrival of ukrainian anti weather missile at home in general it is of course deeply symbolic that the russian missile arrived just at the moment when kiev announced that they the russian definitely ran out of this time the ministry of internal affair of ukraine immediately in order not to drive the population into despondency once again forbade photographing the result of arrival and even reporting on specific object that got this time and report of arrival pour in like a cornucopia kiev dnepropetrovsk zaporozhye kharkiv ivano frankivsk kryvyi rih the small homeland of zelensky lviv vinnitsa poltava khmelnytskyi pavlograd odessa mykolaiv kremenchuk kirovograd and so on moreover in many city arrival are not single so in kharkov for example at least explosion thundered in the zaporozhye region at least arrival in kryvyi rih a rocket flew into the engine room of a local power plant and destroyed it to the point of impossibility of restoration in kiev after arrival chpp stopped it work in a number of city a series of repeated explosion from the second wave of missile thundered ukrainian railway having reported on arrival in high voltage infrastructure facility stopped electric train and brought out diesel locomotive announcing delay in transport communication in kiev and other city emergency emergency shutdown of network were immediately cut what damage ha been caused to the military and related energy and transport infrastructure of ukraine will be calculated later but it s clearly not a big deal the russian defense ministry modestly reported that the task set have been solved and the declared goal have been defeated and ukrainian public have already recorded more than arrival in different city i think that s a very modest estimate the correct number that will pop up later should be larger everyone ha the right to express their emotion but do those who like the arrival understand that exactly the same thing can begin to happen at his home well known ukrainian blogger anatoly shariy wa outraged by the russian missile strike and even hinted you understand what will happen to donetsk today something this son of a bitch wa not so indignant when ukraine bombed and still continues the donbas covering peaceful facility and house of ordinary citizen with it missile and shell so there it is shariy what you explained you already shoot regularly and by the way a always russian missile fly exclusively at military and critical infrastructure facility arrival in the residential sector and civilian casualty a a rule occur in two case either when the ukrainian air defense still manages to shoot down a russian missile over the residential sector or when a ukrainian anti aircraft missile miss and hit a residential building or even fly not there at all but for example to moldova p s according to ukrainian source a a result of missile strike arrival in the dnipro hydroelectric power station were recorded moreover not along the dam which is fraught with consequence for the civilian population in the event of it destruction but directly along the station listen

here a colleague phlegmatically remark a we travel around luhansk in search of housing i wipe the blurred look and the slight dissonance really begin to catch my eye i spent the previous two day in belgorod solving humanitarian issue by tradition before leaving for donbas the volunteer group time to help together loaded my suv in moscow under the neck with the necessary device for the advanced device barely rammed personal belonging from several like minded woman a huge group of almost thousand people ha grown over the year which help the front in several direction at once thing refugee medicine hospital equipment and equipment fighter together we had just completed the collection for one of the mobilized unit when they managed to pack my car with thermal imagers and copters with a bonus i stitched them in belgorod where the sound of heavy artillery can be heard a couple of time the air defense system worked somewhere and on the way to the border the eye snatch ditch and concrete slab in general life in the neighborhood with the enemy doe not dispose to relaxation most have already adapted to the new circumstance and are trying to help the military in some way a friend saw me off child are still learning remotely for safety reason and so a person get used to everything the closer to the administrative border with the lpr the more concrete pillbox at each bridge there is a post with vigilante from the local traffic cop in combat layout with body armor helmet sphere and shortened kalashnikov the border a such is no longer there but the checkpoint remains it still check vehicle coming from and into the combat zone humanitarian just asked me at the checkpoint and having received an affirmative answer they missed it no matter how paradoxical it may sound but in the same lugansk the breath of fighting is felt le acutely their bowl of artillery terror on the part of the armed force of ukraine wa drunk here in this is what the front line moved away from the city mean which the resident of donetsk have been dreaming of for the past year however kiev may soon have way to break this fragile calm in luhansk ukraine is promised to give long range missile to the haymars and then the situation in the capital of the lpr may change the high precision ammunition available to the enemy today reach only the satellite city of lugansk alchevsk perevalsk not so long ago ukrainian cynically shelled a hospital in novoaidar killing people wounded soldier and sick civilian in the meantime lugansk is a rear city in which unlike donetsk there are no interruption in water and electricity hotel are packed for a month ahead and rented housing is extremely difficult to find and expensive in the capital a small house for the campaign minute from the center cost colleague twice a much a i shot in the suburb during the pandemic and then landlord with price did not hesitate in store by the way product are sometimes also more expensive than in moscow because of problem with logistics after all truck are also checked at the checkpoint but for connoisseur of western drink there is a cola that ha left russia imported from belarus and the georgian sprite true a soon a you leave lugansk in the direction of happiness the landscape change in contrast and the closer to the front line the more tangible it breathing is in the direction of kremennaya stretch urals and kamaz with infantry bmps tank in the opposite direction on tractor the damaged equipment is evacuated to the rembats among all this cold iron no no let the regular pazik lugansk kremennaya pa behind the frozen window of which fellow traveler are considered by civilian passenger despite the constant shelling people continue to remain in their home there wa confidence that the kremlin enemy would no longer be able to capture but khokhlu wa meter away from the city my friend recall the commander meeting in a deep dugout near kremennaya then the th airborne division wa transferred here very timely largely thanks to her the position here wa held and then push them away the situation here really changed after i wa in this area of fighting in early december last year it is clear that our military ha become much more numerous including those mobilized thanks to them in fact it wa possible to stabilize the situation here yesterday s civilian today are performing task on the front line with dignity are we going to attack without any hope of a frank answer i ask my friend there is a rumor in the western press that in day we will launch a large scale offensive someone tie this to the news that the lpr is going to disable the mobile internet service from the tariff and it is clearly cut down before some active action however the truth is that there ha been no mobile internet in luhansk since september a turned off before the referendum so hello therefore it is quite logical to remove from the tariff a service that is not provided and we re already advancing look he reveals the map were here now here the enemy wa standing in these forest belt now here we are slowly pushing up what we lost last year we call it active defense in the past week alone and only by lancet kamikaze drone enemy artillery system have been destroyed in the kremennaya area including six american m s the cannonade doe not stop for an hour i catch that there are significantly more outgoing shot than incoming shot and our accuracy ha become an order of magnitude higher confirms my friend we are slowly grinding down what the west wa not sorry to give to ukraine but on the other side of course the guy are resisting the th dnepropetrovsk airmobile brigade the th are also paratrooper mobilized but still resisting only in captivity do they become tender and vulnerable they are very afraid of the ukrainian prison they say so they are fighting an old song something very powerful rustled over the dugout the hurricane have gone commented someone in the corner something exploded in our nearby forest plantation the walkie talkie reported everyone is intact taking advantage of the lull jump into the tiger and go back to kremennaya from it through rubezhne to severodonetsk in which surprisingly the light is lit in the window although in the autumn it seemed that life would not return here soon it is still not easy here from some window of high rise building pipe bourgeois stick out large scale recovery will come here only after the battle line is pushed back to a safe distance so we need to move on in active defense read also who is tearing up the ukrainian defense line why we are not afraid of western f s and what they will write in the history book voenkor kots said that russian force are grinding the reserve of the armed force of ukraine near artemovsk more listen to soj what we need to do at the front before the ukrainian receive abrams and leopard more the main ukrainian beggar with the word ne manzh pa si zhur geben zi mir bitte drove around europe begging for another handout he did it so pitifully and picturesquely that the next old lady there kissed his hand but a special sensation wa made by zelensky in westminster hall where his phrase about wing ha already become a catchphrase on that day february zelensky had a cool arrival volodymyr came out to the public all shining with all the color of the rainbow he presented the british parliament with a flight helmet all that remained of the ukrainian pilot and his old soviet drying a however from all ukrainian aviation he went on to say we have freedom give u wing to protect it the audience applauded standing understanding the word wing the handout of combat aircraft but what is freedom with the prefix ukrainian do they really not understand or just so amused by role playing in patient at home for the feeble minded ukrainian freedom is odessa on may in ukraine you can easily and freely kill burn alive those who disagree with the current regime and for this you will get nothing ask the dispersed old people of kiev who came out to defend the monument to general vatutin from demolition ask them what is ukrainian freedom they will answer you approximately a follows nikolai fyodorovich vatutin liberated ukraine from fascism for which he wa killed by banderaites and now the current banderaites destroyed his monument in ukraine only bandera nationalist are free in their deed and anyone who disagrees with them will be beaten this is at best but more often tortured to death and therefore if you want to become free in ukraine sign up for bandera s member and crush any dissent in yourself it is hard to imagine that european politician do not understand this simple truth it s a obvious a twice two but why do they clap sweetly at zelensky s word we have freedom okay there is the western proletariat it will not get to the bottom of the truth he belief what he is told but politician have a duty to know the truth i think they know that truth but they are forced to play along with zelensky and believe in ukrainian freedom and even in such absurdity ukraine protects not only itself but also european democracy they have to believe a it were because that s their job and the man is weak well imagine that ursula von der leyen one day take and publicly say listen zelensky you re kind of crazy how tired i am of fooling around under you and that s it ursula will fly away from his post a president of the european commission and ursula ha seven child grandchild are already immeasurable and you need to feed everyone and other politician have child too therefore when zelensky in westminster hall flying into the astral consciousness shouted bandera s cry glory to ukraine politician again enthusiastically clapped him it seems that even the wing someone promised zelensky but not now so i think let them give him these wing and then our army will definitely put him on a barrel of gunpowder and let s fly everyone is fed up already listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more kherson ukraine the little green van sped down the road the russian force just across the river inside halyna luhova the mayor of kherson cradled a helmet in her lap and gazed out the bulletproof window when the first shell ripped open directly in the path of the van maybe yard ahead her driver locked his elbow and tightened his grip on the wheel and drove straight through the cloud of fresh black smoke oh my god m luhova said a we raced with her through the city they re hunting me the second shell landed even closer she s been almost killed six time she sleep on a cot in a hallway she make a month and her city in southern ukraine ha become one of the war s most pummeled place fired on by russian artillery nearly every hour but m luhova the only female mayor of a major city in ukraine remains determined to project a sense of normality even though kherson is anything but normal she hold regular meeting in underground bunker she excoriates department head for taking too long to set up bomb shelter she circulates in neighborhood and chit chat with resident whose life have been torn apart by explosion she chalk up any complaint about corruption or mismanagement and there are plenty to rumor mongering by russian backed collaborator who are paid to frustrate her administration kherson a port city on the dnipro river wa captured by russian force in march liberated by ukrainian force in november and now three month later lie nearly deserted pack of out of school child roam the empty boulevard lined with leafless tree and century old building cracked in half m luhova see her job defined by basic verb bury clean fix and feed of the percent or so of kherson s original population of who remain many are too old too poor too stubborn or too strung out to flee she recently became so overwhelmed with their need for food water generator internet access bus pension medicine firewood that she said she dropped to minute of sleep a night and became so exhausted she had to be put on intravenous drug she feel better she said though not exactly calm we need those bomb shelter now she snapped at a meeting in early february when it wa several degree below freezing outside in front of her in an underground office sat the head of the city s main department many in winter jacket and hat the office had no heat she wa pushing to acquire dozen of free standing concrete bomb shelter when an administrator responded that the contracting process needed to be followed or they could be accused of corruption she exploded you are doing nothing and i m getting really pissed off at your stupidity m luhova said i feel like i don t have enough air when i m standing next to you you will answer in your own blood your own blood the administrator rolled his eye and went outside to smoke a cigarette in a political culture dominated by macho guy the mayor of the capital of kyiv for instance is a towering former heavyweight boxing champion m luhova in her gray suede boot and black puffy jacket with the fake fur collar cut a different figure raised by a single mom during the soviet union s last gasp she laughed thinking about the hardship back then all those terrible line for beet root imagine beet root she said by the time she wa ukraine wa newly independent and she wa teaching english at a neighborhood school married and a mother she climbed the rank to school director which she used a a springboard to be elected to kherson s city council eight year ago before the russian invasion last february she wa the council s secretary considered the no official russian force burned down her house in march and she left the city shortly after the russian tried to make kherson part of russia forcing child to learn russian in school and people to use russian ruble in the market in june they kidnapped her bos kherson s prior mayor and he hasn t been seen since m luhova took his place and became the head of kherson s military administration when she returned in november she found a city ecstatic that the russian had been driven out but in terrible shape the russian had looted everything from water treatment equipment and century old fine art to kherson s fleet of fire truck and bus but the russian didn t go far ukraine didn t have the momentum or spare troop to pursue them across the river so now the russian sit on the opposite bank across from kherson and fire at will no city in ukraine outside the donbas region in the east where the russian are advancing is getting shelled a badly a kherson in the past two and half month ukrainian official said it ha been hit more than time the shell come with no warning there are no air raid siren these are projectile fired from tank artillery gun mortar and rocket launcher that blow up a few second later the russian are that close meter in some place resident have almost no time to take cover the other afternoon a rocket attack killed two men walking down a sidewalk there wa no military installation nearby russia s precise rationale for expending it strained ammunition stock here is unclear said a recent british defense intelligence update on kherson since mid november ukrainian official say the russian have wounded hundred of resident and killed more than it s just revenge m luhova said there s an old saying if i can t have it nobody can she said trying to explain why the russian would shell the city after retreating it s that stupid but it s true kherson may be a war torn city on the front line of europe s deadliest conflict in generation and m luhova may represent ukraine s never give up spirit that keep a russian flag from flying over this country but a in any other city resident love complaining about their mayor i ve called more than a hundred time to have my electricity fixed and nobody come said olena yermolenko a retiree who helped run a cell of citizen spy during the russian occupation she also repeated accusation on social medium that the mayor wa stealing humanitarian aid which m luhova strongly denied oleksandr slobozhan the executive director of the association of ukrainian city said that from everything he knew the accusation were a smear campaign by pro russian agent despite the challenge m luhova is determined to keep the city running in the most basic way she recently traveled to kyiv to ask mr slobozhan for bus we are paralyzed she said our trolley don t work and we can t fix them because when our worker go up to repair the line the sniper are killing them she left with a promise of bus i like the way she work mr slobozhan later said she go forward no matter what m luhova is planning to attend a donor s conference in poland later this month she ha been out of the country only a few time in her life where she really want to go is bali i heard you go there and you come back looking younger she joked her husband is a taxi driver in another city and her two adult son live far away so she is on her own in kherson most day she can be found moving around in her little green van when we rode along with her and the shell exploded on the road her driver turned around a fast a he could but the russian were tracking her from across the river they fired a second round it slammed into a house along the road and the blast wave shook the van the van kept going but the munition felt lethally intimate that evening at a house where she stay with friend on a small pullout bed in a hallway off the kitchen m luhova shrugged off the close call over a spread of deliciously crunchy homemade pickle and little square of brie she held a glass of cognac between her finger and made a toast to victory if i could disappear into the air and end this war i would she said i d easily sacrifice myself for ending this hell soldier of the private military company wagner were waiting for me at the very hour when the rooster and ukrainian gunner had not yet woken up so early that there wa no point in going to bed the meeting place wa somewhat familiar to me the outskirt of the city of pervomaisky lpr it is part of an absolutely fantastic agglomeration of industrial city stakhanov alchevsk bryanka zorinsk irmino almaznoye in size it can be compared only with the slavic kramatorsk agglomeration which is not far from here satellite in these part are silenced navigator do not work therefore i drove from memory in the summer of i wa in pervomaisk with a curious mission we gathered rural community living under the shelling of the armed force of ukraine and people showing their passport with a trident asked in front of the camera why doe ukraine treat it citizen like this i have recorded dozen of collective appeal for referral to the international criminal court the case wa accepted for consideration and that wa the end of it since then pervomaisk ha suffered even more a i immediately called it a city with half of broken window i did not think that the path to the front line would be so long only later i navigated the map and realized that we were driving around bakhmut artemovsk in a giant arc to jump out to it northern outskirt in one of the village the car wa changed to armor i have been for many year rolling on the armor will not cheer me up especially since the thermometer in the car showed minus i climbed into the troop compartment and landed on the triplex with the bullet trail the brand new ifv roared and rushed to the front so that i rolled along the bench we drove very long and very fast jumped open field huddled in forest plantation sometimes moved with a natural snake i thought about one thing if only the car at such speed did not undress but the mechvod knew his stuff already in podgorny i asked about the speed at which we walked about km h at least some guarantee that the car will not be loaded and such curtained car with bright red burnt body i saw through the triplex a lot maybe there were ukropsky maybe ours everyone here know how to use anti tank guided missile system love them and respect them another chip of this campaign a well a the mass use of quadcopters understanding the state of a fighting formation is very simple look at the boot here most of the shoe were bought for their own very good and expensive brand i wa the only one in my rubber boot on top of the clothes is also different who is in the statutory pixel who is in the slide a it is convenient for whom almost all the weapon encountered by fighter with tuning are sight butt telescope single point belt dtk muzzle brake compensators about half of this beauty is trophy which suggests that the unit is fighting and fighting successfully i wa shown the point from which it wa possible to shoot bakhmut in the morning ray of the gentle winter sun the block of high rise building seemed sugary and even sparkled but in front of them in the offensive line of these guy lay a vast industrial zone the most unpleasant object for our assault team we did not walk around the village it doe not matter in what condition the armed force of ukraine are it arrives with different periodicity and the village street are still full of surprise we for example crossed such a dense line of anti tank mine planted in three row the hull of one mine wa opened by a fragment and a yellowish tol is visible one of the fighter explained to me why the minefield had not been removed and the mine in two direction work now on u blocking the passage of someone else s armor into this part of the village little remains of the village and judging by the fresh crater it is covered constantly all tree are cut like a razor to the middle on the road are abandoned minibus on which the enemy moved and did not have time to go far those who could left on foot bakhmut is a stone s throw away we dive into an inconspicuous house it only warm room judging by the pungent smell of diesel it wa warmed up with a dropper stove on the floor dozen of package with mineral water kept warm so a not to freeze the guy i spoke to were wearing mask that s the custom in pmcs the first interlocutor from voronezh year old i volunteered in september wait it wa the most unpleasant month redeployment we left the territory that s why i came you ve been fighting for six month you can compare what ha changed in our country during this time artillery began to strike more accurately and the enemy ha changed no a they fled from u they are running the second interlocutor wa older kropot fought in the second chechen there is a military specialty and also from the autumn volunteer embarrassed by his mask i tell him that his portrait will be a hit of the number how the opponent feel i started shooting le often according to my observation it happened a month or two ago in most case now the enemy retreat put banner began to be lined with mine sometimes he roll on u counterattack author ukrop aviation also recently doe not work a before i ask kropot about plan for a peaceful life i ll get married i ll finally have kid i turn off the camera kropot get up take off his mask and declares oh and it wa hard now it s easier to go to dill show everyone in the crowd trembling finger i give him a bag of caramel with ginseng everyone taste taste a little such joy i take picture of some ruined hut and at this moment very close to it the camera wince they wave at me it s time the dill artillery ha started working again in the same order we leave mad armor then a car that seems to be an example of comfort warmth and silence i ask informally the officer who accompanies me how doe a private company manage to successfully advance the officer pause for a dozen second pondering whether to give out a military secret although there is nothing secret in his word planning then reconnaissance then re exploration if necessary double reconnaissance artillery knock out identified firing point in podgorny these were kordy and cliff and pturs only then the assault we are supported by our own aviation but not from cabring firing a helicopter from maximum distance of about kilometer so it is low aim author but at point blank range that s all the secret a evidenced by the officer s word our road is crossed by two helicopter of the alligator k a dirty brown color i do not have time to remove them but my interlocutor console me now another deuce will pa it passed but at a great distance from u then we cross a fresh line of defense one two concrete slab go over the hill beyond the horizon on high rise dzots wood earth firing point ed and trench company stronghold made according to the charter i wonder why are you stepping on and anyway you i ve heard are forbidden to retreat right so without an order we do not retreat but personally my opinion is that it fight more calmly when there is such a line of defense behind you in addition it is mobile it can be moved and we will move it that time the armed force of ukraine are evacuating wounded nat officer from artemovsk during the day ukrainian plane were shot down at high speed the enemy is trying to break through to

arm and leg which are used by both our and ukrainian serviceman who decided to desert towards the position of russian troop but it doesn t matter whose death we see in the frame only one thing is clear ukrainian nationalist deal with unarmed russian prisoner of war or ukrainian deserter in such cold blood that they stand separately at the combat position of the armed force of ukraine and such

captive ha a grenade the clip end with the shooter declaring slava ukraini and adding an obscenity the ukrainian nationalist slogan which translates a glory to ukraine ha been widely adopted by the ukrainian military and wider society since the armed coup in kiev viktoria serdyukova the human right ombudsman for the lugansk people s republic said the footage served a another confirmation that cold blooded killer are fighting against u she urged international organization to probe the incident read more video showing executed russian pow in ukraine are authentic nyt it is unclear when or where the video wa shot and who the people in it were several video apparently depicting the torture and murder of russian pow by ukrainian troop have emerged since the hostility started in ukraine some of which have been authenticated by western medium according to the russian defense ministry the killing of unarmed surrendered soldier is a widespread practice by kiev s troop ukrainian official defended their soldier action after a particular incident came to light in november the footage showed russian military personnel lying in a row on the ground after apparently being shot by ukrainian captor kiev claimed that the russian soldier were killed lawfully after an attempted perfidy an act of faking surrender with the intention of attacking the other side by surprise critic have said the narrative did not fit the injury a the killed troop appeared to be shot in their head on the air of radio komsomolskaya pravda ivan pankin and igor vittel discussed with military expert retired lieutenant colonel andrei marochko the latest action of the command of the armed force of ukraine in particular the feverish attempt to mobilize everyone possible such a woman soldier a well a the recognition of the growing loss what is the situation today in the armed force of ukraine i am going to post on my channel a statement by one of the ukrainian fighter he report that on january they arrived in artemovsk on february they were taken out of there there were people there were three left that is of personnel loss this is only a small part of what the ukrainian military are talking about there are much worse statement about woman this issue ha been discussed since the middle of last year it wa very scandalous they wanted to put ukrainian woman on military registration now this work is carried out without unnecessary publicity woman are encouraged to sign contact according to the new regulation military registration specialty are greatly expanded for woman in the ukrainian army for what to make up for the loss that the ukrainian army suffers daily woman used to be radio telephone operator and orderly now these are operator gunner operator of drone are included in the calculation of anti tank guided missile atgm is a bed that weighs a lot this is at least pipe this is optic which you need to pull on yourself all this is quite difficult because you still need to make a march throw for kilometer to the combat position the fact that woman are actively attracted is natural on the kiev side yes we remember the statement from the other side that they will fight to the last ukrainian gender wa not specified hence to the last woman and who are these woman in ukraine there are not so many way to make money now the difficult economic situation force woman to go earn money wherever possible most of the able bodied men are at the front many woman have family that need to be maintained and there are many woman who consciously take such a step we need to take this fact seriously why woman are more violent more insidious since i have met with woman soldier on several occasion they re more motivated than men let s remember the same nadya savchenko and other radical young lady look at their statement how they behave the fact that woman appear in the ukrainian army is not a fact that weakens it what do you think about kadyrov s word that the special operation will be completed before the end of logical statement but there are a huge number of factor including the supply of weapon by the west the soviet weapon and ammunition that the armed force of ukraine had ran out in the summer now ukraine is conducting all military operation practically with nato weapon this is confirmed by information from the contact line i talk to the guy they say if earlier nato ammunition wa something supernatural when it flew at u now soviet or ukrainian ammunition is already surprising on the line of combat contact of what fly through u is western weapon western ammunition almost no longer is fired from soviet type of weapon weapon of nato caliber are used this is mm this is the th mortar this is the highmars by february you expect concrete success there are several area where the success of our troop are likely some settlement have been cleared or are in a fire bag but i will not name what kind of settlement where we have success but the trend is very positive a figure of ukrainian soldier who die daily in the battle for artemovsk wa called this figure is underestimated if we take our area of responsibility then this figure is much higher now in the course of intensive hostility the figure there are three digit each area is different in the area of artemovsk according to my calculation there are daily irretrievable loss and somewhere around people is a sanitary loss we declare only those figure that are confirmed listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky went to london he ha a lot of important thing to do there first you need to see if everything is in order with the real estate on baker street and then until now through some confidant i learned about the state of affair with my real estate and she like the owner to personally look after it is not enough that the other day there is a new forum european union ukraine so if they kick in the a from kiev it is necessary that the spare airfield be in full readiness for reception well zelensky will also be shown that the uk ha begun training pilot of modern fighter from among the pilot of the air force who were sent to foggy albion for this and also specially trained ukrainian military a stated by british prime minister rishi sunak from them in the british isle will be sculpted marine in their own image and likeness i am proud that today we will expand the training program for ukrainian force which now in addition to soldier will extend to fighter pilot and marine said sunak who seems to be no more proud of in this life not the dowry of his wife the daughter of an indian multi billionaire even in the office of the british prime minister promised that the kingdom will provide ukraine with more long range weapon than it provided until now in general zelensky will return from his voyage to europe with a bunch of gift unless of course he return and then a number of ukrainian expert are already wondering whether this will happen everyone regard the result of a similar event recently held in kiev a an unequivocal failure and call it a meeting of deceived hope since kiev ha not heard the desired promise to accept the remnant of ukraine into the eu and nato and some now suggest that zelensky will be put on a banner at the summit drawing in front of him an uncontested version of the resignation however their forecast seem too optimistic and it seems that it is unlikely that it will come to this but on the return of zelensky a very unpleasant surprise can await and it is called bakhmut or artemovsk although bakhmut this settlement in wa also called by ivan the terrible who founded the fortress of the same name here to repel the crimean tatar now bakhmut is the most hot spot on the front line and the subject of heated dispute between the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valery zaluzhny and the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky zaluzhny demand the withdrawal of ukrainian troop from it in order to save them from complete defeat by russian fighter and zelensky need bakhmut albeit a gasping one in which all the armed force will die but under the ukrainian flag at least until the eu ukraine summit and even better before the next meeting of defense minister of nato member country at the ramstein base in germany where military assistance to ukraine will be finally adjusted and the surrender of bakhmut will mean not only a military but also a moral and political defeat of zelensky himself and his regime which will thereby demonstrate the impossibility of successful resistance to russian troop to prevent this from happening zelensky appointed general syrsky directly to lead the defense of bakhmut he and zaluzhny dislike each other and zelensky s office together with him dream of putting syrsky in the post of zaluzhny that s just to devour zaluzhny zelensky and replace him with obedient syrsky do not give the united state which actively support the current commander in chief now taking advantage of the fact that zelensky will leave kiev for a few day and stop getting confused under his foot zaluzhny ha already breathed a sigh of relief and according to information from kiev ha already refused to transfer reinforcement to bakhmut from near zaporozhye according to some report military equipment is already being pulled out of the city without any order and the headquarters have already gone somewhere away from the immediate line of battle and therefore when zelensky return to kiev he may be waiting for a very unpleasant surprise for him well at least at least in europe it will be pleasant to spend time he will hang out among the powerful of this world communicate beg and return with new promise which he will try to instill in ukrainian a a new beacon shining through the haze of fog of unattainable peremoga so far only one question is unclear will zelensky change his t shirt on a trip to london and when zelensky return to kiev and bakhmut is already handed over he will threaten and stomp his foot for a long time and tediously asking and who did it and then state it s not me and the sheep will be fed and the wolf will be whole and there is no error in this sentence listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more in i discussed

ukraine wa under occupation by russian troop who cut off roughly resident from the outside world there wa no running water or power and russian soldier would often snatch their cellphone and stomp on them fearful that local would betray their location resident said the only medical care wa provided by two village nurse who braved the constant shelling to make house call with limited supply and medicine though ukrainian force recaptured levkivka in september reconnecting the village to basic service ha come slowly power and water are back but medical care is still hard to come by the medical truck provided by the united nation population fund and staffed with doctor from the city of kharkiv mile to the north travel around the region part of a continuing ukrainian government effort to bring a semblance of normalcy to once occupied village in the east with russian troop dug in just mile away and the occasional rumble of artillery in the distance there is a palpable sense of urgency ukraine s military may have cleared the immediate area of russian force but fully controlling territory mean more than planting a flag and in the village of eastern ukraine where many local speak a blend of ukrainian and russian called surzhik loyalty to kyiv is not guaranteed viktor putyetin who came to the mobile clinic for a checkup said in a whisper that there wa significant support for the russian troop in levkivka though he strongly opposed the kremlin s design on ukraine he said that under occupation he approached a year old russian soldier operating an air defense battery who wa wearing an arm patch with the soviet hammer and sickle i asked him sonny have you ever seen the soviet union mr putyetin said in the soviet union you had to wipe your butt with newspaper because there wa no toilet paper ask your dad about that while the war is not far from people s mind most in the village are preoccupied with more quotidian concern like renewing drug prescription and dealing with their hypertension and diabetes many who arrived for medical checkup were woman either xa older adult xa or young mother with baby halina romashenko gave birth to a son sasha just a ukrainian force were pushing russian troop out of the area for seven month she received no prenatal care and said she had to hide in her potato cellar a rocket crashed into the field around her home she said her family had no money to move and nowhere else to go so we had to stay here m romashenko said valentina kalashnikova her grandmother accompanied her to the clinic putting on sparkly pink lipstick for the occasion the stress of the occupation had aggravated her high blood pressure a shell destroyed her kitchen and two of her cow were killed she made an effort to smile brightly but at time she could not keep the tear at bay i m scared of course mostly for them she said pointing to her grandchild and great grandchild i m a war granny levkivka a village of tidy home along the siversky donets river is in a region mangled by vicious fighting the carcass of tank and armored vehicle their metal hide perforated by rocket litter the rolling farm field whole village have been simply wiped out with pile of brick and charred wood where house once stood russian troop did not subject resident of levkivka to the kind of horror endured in place like the kyiv suburb of bucha or irpin where hundred of civilian were killed but their presence wa still traumatic local said tatyana budyanska one of the two nurse in town said she wa on her way to a house call her year old grandson in tow when russian troop stopped her and accused her of passing information to ukrainian force they put an automatic rifle to the boy s head she said but ultimately let them go compared with many neighboring village levkivka appears relatively unscathed a bit of good fortune that local attribute to the russian military s decision to retreat before the arrival of ukrainian troop one morning resident woke up and the xa russian force were just gone this ha made levkivka a refuge for people whose home fared far worse halina cherednichenko who is almost and walk with a pronounced hunch recalled rushing for water

isolated and suffering from the effect of stress hypertension is a major problem she said but in general people have held up well i thought thing would be much worse said m okunyeva they ll never beat our people for many it is still difficult to suppress fear that the war will return to their village fighting ha intensified nearby and it appears a though russian force are preparing for a new offensive aimed at taking back some of the territory recaptured last year mine scattered in the farm field periodically explode straining the nerve we re alive but still we live in fear said nina kachenko the war is still not over while the mother received checkup for their infant in the medical truck a cardiologist with the group took over an office in the town s clinic nearby seeing mostly older patient outside the office local got into a spirited debate over whether russian might rise up one day to overthrow their president vladimir v putin just a ukrainian once expelled their kremlin backed president in a popular uprising in halina kapran who wa dressed in a gray fur hat said she believed that support for mr putin wa low among russian and that one day they would liberate themselves mr putyetin dismissed the notion arguing that propaganda had turned russian into obedient farm animal halina if i told you every day that you were a cow you d believe it he said inside the medical office the doctor wa busy checking electrocardiogram and blood pressure he also wa dispensing prescription for anti anxiety medicine gennady grigorievich at night we received information from denis pushilin that chemical poisonous substance were dropped from drone on the position of our troop in the ugledar and artemovsky direction this caused coughing general malaise tear we commented on a similar situation about a month ago then on the territory of the donetsk people s republic serviceman who are in combat formation also noticed exactly the same symptom that you are talking about i am to you both a a hero of labor of the dpr and a a person who head the donbas community in moscow and a a scientist who took part in international symposium on this topic on the fight against chemical weapon how would you comment on all this well first of all there are no chemical weapon in ukraine that s for sure how more precisely it shouldn t have been all it reserve which were stored there in the day of the soviet union were liquidated where then did they come from this is clearly the supply of the master of the evil and hostile kiev regime although the use of chemical weapon during hostility is a direct violation of the well known opc convention the opcw is an international organization established with the support of the united nation on april after the entry into force of the chemical weapon convention opened for signature in january in the opcw wa awarded the nobel peace prize well by the master of the kiev regime you mean because nothing is being done in ukraine without their direction therefore it is possible to record the fact that the united state contrary to the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapon to which they are signatory and of which they are member violates all conceivable agreement just combat recipe are the work of the american military along with nato country and today it seems to me our foreign ministry need to declare that in reality one of the type of weapon of mass destruction is supplied to ukraine and used during hostility that is let s still specify these weapon could be delivered from the state or from europe the united state and europe are the same thing in this case if we destroyed ton of stockpile of these weapon the american did not eliminate even half of their more than ton although we made a joint commitment we fulfilled it exactly within the time frame in which we promised although we had much fewer chemical weapon and the american under the pretext that they did not have money let it go on the brake and today the use of chemical weapon is nato and nato is also the puppet government of france and great britain germany true the german are especially trying they apparently want to go down in history a worthy successor to the work of comrade hitler who also used chemical weapon we don t need to call him a comrade but there may be some mean of protection against this depends on what weapon there are different kind but antidote drug that stop or weaken the effect of poison or toxic substance on the body a g which are usually introduced into the body in advance in case of danger of using such weapon there are also gas mask isolating suit that allow soldier to conduct combat operation in the territory where these weapon are used let s hope we have these remedy well we ve always had them another thing is how many of them there are and most importantly what weapon are used that s what we are talking about and we must not forget that donetsk and artemovsk are very densely populated area and the use of these weapon by the armed force of ukraine first of all affect the unprotected civilian population in this regard child the elderly woman thanks for the interview listen a well ukraine wanted to get nuclear weapon for security assurance more rosgvardeytsy in the zone of special military operation svo on the territory of the lugansk people s republic seized more than

failure to implement the minsk agreement of which were intended to form a roadmap for peace in donbas russian official have argued that the military operation preempted an attempt by kiev to retake by force the territory that broke away from ukraine after the armed coup in the capital in the early morning an inconspicuously dirty minibus left donetsk in the crew of the car wa the monk cyprian hero of the soviet union read the interview with him on our website kp ru my old friend from the tv channel spa andrei afanasyev and a very young priest of one of the moscow church father george he will conduct short service in battalion take communion and confess in a photo lens case and pouch he ha everything he need for worship at the wheel is a lieutenant colonel with the call sign japanese fighting from slavyansk one of the earthly patron of this unusual phenomenon orthodox battalion we talk quietly japanese explains to me the essence of our mission from the beginning of the svo i wa struck by this phenomenon running from the front or five hundredth some people were psychologically unprepared for combat the authority say to their guardhouse i disagree like if so there will be more people tomorrow why they feed warm and don t kill and then i started calling people out for preventative talk i talked for many hour and showed them my icon which have been with me for the last year the japanese reach into his pocket and show me a stack of tiny image pulled over with a rubber band this one wa in the certificate of the militiaman who gave me strelkov my patron george the victorious i sigh and say i have the same stack always with me i take out a zip bag from my backpack in it a dozen sample and prayer book worn torn soaked in rain and many time glued there are no atheist in the trench the japanese continues i realized that these people have only fear but no faith here near the sand after heavy fighting one of the unit completely lost it combat capability the commander is under stress cannot give a clear command at the same time he is a captain of the ministry of internal affair two decade in danger how so and our entire hour long conversation with him boiled down to faith it strengthens a believer see his protection not only in a bulletproof vest and a helmet that captain ha changed yes he didn t become the best commander no but he is no worse than others he overcame the horror of the adaptation period of fighting i then counted that i had conducted conversation in fact small sermon it became clear that clergy were needed on the front line and the military path of the unit need to be filled with meaning especially if there is a battle against evil the process of renaming the numbered battalion wa spontaneous which already indicates god s providence the first to appear wa the ru battalion the second is the alexander nevsky battalion reservist held the so called donetsk gate a problem area that the enemy viewed a the main entrance to the city the battalion for reinforcement wa given two special force to make a rustle it turned out the enemy recorded activity postponed the attack in one of the battle a special force officer with the call sign nevsky wa killed he looked like a legendary warrior prince it wa impossible to enroll nevsky forever in the list of the unit technically and bureaucratically and then in memory of him the battalion wa named after st alexander nevsky on his chevron are two rifle with an oblique st andrew s cross the old three line mosin the weapon of local reservist in the first month of the svo and the new russian lobaev rifle a a symbol of the future and above this composition is the helmet of alexander nevsky we are going to a battalion named after the not yet canonized new martyr the warrior yevgeny rodionov who refused to remove the cross and wa brutally killed by militant in the first chechen war the battalion took verkhnetoretskoye in it father george must serve a prayer service and give communion to the soldier father george is the first time in donbas i understand perfectly well that this is an act i feel his inner anxiety and take on the role of a guide trying to explain to my father what is around u we turn to yasynuvataya saying let s go along the military road this is the once gorgeous horlivka donetsk highway it is partially cut by the armed force of ukraine we are bypassing this section local who are not afraid go to horlivka here others go around through yenakiieve rarely but on the highway the armed force of ukraine are engaged in harassing fire there is an area where the curb is lined with sandbag so that car are not visible father george peer into the gray foggy distance and asks how far is the enemy here i shrug my shoulder like kilometer but with the weather we were lucky we slip through the village of krasny partizan tell the first settlement recaptured from the enemy in on one side of the highway were dill on the other ours igor bezler the commander of the gorlovka garrison in when he went to donetsk brought cigarette to the dryer talked to them then everything changed of course and i tell father george a terrible story that plowed over me and still sits inside out in that clearing lay a bunch of dead dryer covered with the ukrainian flag the military kp took a picture of this the most famous picture and then a priest in semi catholic semi orthodox robe uniate came to pick up the dead but none of the fighter wanted to help him and then this priest shouted are you human or not human is there something human in you and fighter they spoke one by one you are not a priest we have other priest you unwound my house you killed my sister the corp were loaded of course but then for the first time i realized that what wa happening wa not politics everything wa in a different plane the commander of the battalion named after yevgeny rodionov is called sedoy he is gray haired on the front call sign just do not give in the raspolag in a half ruined ice house there is a chapel lovingly arranged in the former main entrance to the building there are even wall lined with marble the demon smelled something and with the beginning of this short service shelling began then our artillery joined in plane arrived the soldier pressed against the wall and only the priest served in the center of this small hall a if in nothing unprecedented and i stood with my back to the wide wooden door and with each arrival or exit of the shell goosebump the size of a fist ran down the neck father george remained to confess and commune the fighter and gray took father cyprian to verkhnetoretskoye to show the destroyed temple of dmitry solunsky and the place where the battalion is fighting at the entrance to the village there is burned armor and some rag remained from it it is difficult to guess what kind of car they were gray sigh there were only rifle battle in the village and what you see now wa destroyed by ukrainian artillery over the past year they just take and work out the village square by square there is no light but people are still coming back to the question of whether priest are needed on the front line the battalion commander answer firmly we do it s hard for people they would have comfort a good conversation we drive on to gorlovka to the scout there awaits u the front line priest father k and the zampolit s batushka laugh today we were at the position we took communion so the zampolit kept the board it is impossible to show father k half of the diocese is still under the armed force of ukraine and they are just waiting for an occasion to start a i wa told bluntly the massacre of the orthodox zampolit begin to think aloud where would i take you to drink tea and talk maybe to the girl monk cyprian throw up his hand well of course where else to take the monk only to the girl let s go soon if there wa no dirt under their foot everyone would come down laughing we arrive at some office the girl have already made tea father cyprian and father k quietly communicate on completely prosaic topic for example military chaplain are provided for by the state but such a vus is not a military specialty at all what to do and i m guessing that the monk cyprian himself a retired colonel is having a second task here figuring out how to make the institution of the military priesthood work i whisper to the zampolit and he say amazing thing the soldier of the gorlovka brigade could not take the enemy s stronghold they rolled back there were wounded then they refused to attack at all and then the zampolit and the priest came to their original position we talked took communion and a miracle of some kind they took the midfielder without loss i ask a painful question and is there mercy among the battle and the zampolit tell me another story during the assault the fighter herded two men into the dugout on the threshold of the dugout lie our wounded the dryer refuse to surrender the wounded are in fact hostage to them and then the fighter swore to god that he would let go of the dill kombat scolded him of course but in his heart he understood that such oath could not be broken and our fighter wa saved this is the main thing our extreme point is the battalion named forty martyr of sebaste named after the roman soldier who converted to christianity and suffered terrible torment for this and the service itself in the raspolag resembled the service of the first christian catacomb a dark inner corridor with a low ceiling and only dozen of yellow candle in the hand of warrior are warming and very close to sigh with tear and toss and turn a close marinka whom everyone can not take today one of the sapper with the call sign belorus performed a feat he cleared the passage to the bank building for the assault group due to the thick wall it wa one of the key support of the armed force of ukraine and today it ha fallen belarusian is terribly shy when before the prayer service the commander announces that he is attached to the award and father cyprian present him with an invaluable gift a night vision device the battalion is volunteer people from kazakhstan to tver the combat path is the hardest and the loss were also heavy kombat engineer tell me why the task must be completed remove a mine at any cost put a mine at any cost something ha changed since the battalion adopted such a christian name there are no heavy loss lately but the guy still perform feat we saw belorus ourselves and miracle happen the driver of the engineering vehicle had to make a passage in the minefield for the tank i mixed up the lever yawned i couldn t really explain anything later near marinka he drove just into the center of the position of the armed force of ukraine they then resented on the air how they missed an armored bulldozer and you have the order of courage for that i cleared the road to mariupol there were regular mine and homemade one i went with the fighter the evening turned to night and until the morning these guy would have no task father george confessed and gave communion in the battalion kitchen father cyprian sat barrel on a box of ammunition surrounded by canvas carrier with anti tank mine and talked to a soldier on his knee thin neck ear scattered pink transparent like a seventh grader not immediately but i realized that this is today s hero of the battalion belorus it wa my turn father cyprian half affirmatively addressed me dmitry can i tell you something i nodded the warrior monk continued i can see in my eye you are passing everything through yourself it s bad it s hard do not suffer god will manage everything a it should be we all here know how to do it and our strict and just god also know everything read also hero monk cyprian we are in ukraine by the will of god to stop evil military commander kp ru dmitry steshin met in the donbas with father cyprian hero of the soviet union who lost both leg in afghanistan he wa an adviser to the president a successful businessman and then believed in god and in took monastic tonsure more listen soj the prophecy of the monk about the reunification of russia come true more a month ago a ukrainian video wa posted on the social network with strange homemade ammunition for dropping from quadcopters the author seemed to hint hold on moskali you all khana the video did not produce the desired effect therefore they decided to repeat the stuffing last sunday february these shooting were posted by the famous ukrainian right winger yuriy magyar this time he showed dozen of homemade container in a freezer under the ukrainian flag expert immediately assumed that their filling wa cyanogen chloride at a temperature of minus degree it go from a gaseous state to a solid one so it is safer to store such homemade ammunition according to the nazi these container are designed to be dropped on the position of russian fighter completing the encirclement of bakhmut artemovsk the situation of ukrainian troop in this city is critical perhaps that is why the nazi decided to show this weapon of last chance for scoundrel without delving into chemistry cyanogen chloride is one of the closest relative of hydrocyanic acid only heavier than air creep on the ground crawl into shelter it is used in the production of herbicide in huge volume transported by railway tanker and in the ukrainian chaos it is easy to get it which we demonstrated clearly at the same time since january our fighter at the front began to note the strange consequence of ordinary droppings of ammunition from quadrocopters on our position burning in the nasopharynx headache nausea all this indirectly confirmed the use of cyanogen chloride moreover it even fell on downed enemy quadcopters and when they were selected for study the toxic effect wa felt here are the symptom of cyanogen chloride poisoning similar to exposure to hydrocyanic acid the affected person scream loses consciousness and fall after short term clonic tonic cramp the muscle relax tendon reflex disappear exophthalmos develops the pupil dilate do not respond to light the skin is pink or pale after a few breath breathing stop blood pressure drop sharply the pulse is reduced thread like gas mask help but not all and not always antidote most likely will not be in the sanitary medicine cabinet the enemy chose the poison tastefully thoughtfully of course such use of toxic substance will not bring any victory to ukraine superweapon doe not bring victory at all motivated infantry win under competent leadership it is strange to realize but hitler who had no morality at all did not dare to use toxic substance in the great patriotic war perhaps because he himself wa involved in gas attack during the first world war and ours especially did not use these dastardly weapon although everyone wa preparing considering such a possibility wearing gas mask anti hasten cape and special antidote wa mandatory on both side of the front the german had a whole line of chemical munition at the front for example mortar mine marked hb or the so called blendcorpergranaten but they were equipped with smoke compound or an unpleasant but harmless in comparison tear gas chloracetophenone it is clear that at any time the filling of ammunition could be replaced ours were engaged in the development of fire mixture for their use there were so called ampulomets and sharomets at the front which produce glass ammunition but no one dared to use combat poison gas then but the ukrainian did in this story the deliberate demonstration of a new superweapon which by the way is prohibited by all possible convention attracts itself and the second point is the silence of the west there are two assumption here or the ukrainian are convinced that they will not be anything even for such a crime it would be russia that would be nailed declared a fiend of hell adding new sanction to it and kiev with some other heavy weapon and ukraine can do anything burn do not be shy or the second option this provocation is coordinated and thought out it is not the personal initiative of the degenerate magyar and his brother they are trying to bring russia to the retaliatory use of unconventional mean of warfare what for to scroll the flywheel of the conflict one more turn the right sector is an extremist organization of ukrainian nationalist banned in russia there are fact of application according to the statement of our unit this is not only in the artyomovsk direction but also in the ugledarsk direction there are fact of the use of chemical compound that cause malaise in our serviceman complaint from fighter have been received for at least three week they are dropping from drone

that could soon swallow m degtyaryova s village of nevske and perhaps much more in the eastern ukrainian region known a the donbas but already the impact of russia s stepped up assault is being felt

expected to punch hard looking to reverse nearly a year of cascading failure while a renewed attack on kyiv is now considered improbable russian force will likely try to recover territory they lost last fall a well a take full control of the donbas a key objective of russia s president vladimir v putin military analyst say that one likely scenario would be for russian force to swing down from the north and up from the south in an arc creating a large claw that would cut off ukrainian supply line running east and west that would put village like nevske in the direct path of russia s likely advance for local it would be a disaster out here at the far edge of ukraine s offensive people have not experienced the fruit of liberation the way ukrainian farther west have there is still no power or water and the fighting ha never subsided field of black unharvested sunflower are pocked with snow filled crater and the area is littered with burned out tank and unexploded ordnance and mine that frequently kill livestock passing through the region one occasionally come across their frozen body or bone in makiivka just north of nevske five of ruslan vasilchenko s cow have been killed and those that remain were huddled on a recent day in a tiny barn that had been spackled with shrapnel there wa a burned tank in his garden and two destroyed car in his courtyard he said he expected thing would get much worse soon over the last few day the soldier have come by to tell u not to leave our home he said the first stage of the russian offensive have already begun ukrainian troop say that bakhmut an eastern ukrainian city that russian force have been trying to seize since the summer is likely to fall soon elsewhere russian force are advancing in small group and probing the front line looking for ukrainian weakness the effort are already straining ukraine s military which is worn out by nearly month of heavy fighting troop say they have tank and artillery piece but not enough of either and have far le ammunition than their adversary russian force have also started to field more sophisticated weaponry like the t tank which is equipped with technology capable of detecting the targeting system of anti tank weapon like the american made javelin limiting their effectiveness mostly though the challenge come down to number it s particularly difficult when you have guy and they have said a year old infantry soldier named pavlo who wa struck in the eye with a piece of shrapnel from a rocket propelled grenade near bakhmut you take them out and they keep coming and coming there are so many loss among ukrainian force have been severe troop in a volunteer contingent called the carpathian sich positioned near nevske said that some fighter from their group had died in recent week and soldier said only partly in jest that just about everyone ha a concussion it s winter and the position are open there s nowhere to hide said a soldier from the unit with the call sign rusin at one frontline hospital in the donbas the morgue wa packed with the body of ukrainian soldier in white plastic bag in another hospital stretcher with wounded troop covered in gold foil thermal blanket crowded the corridor and a steady stream of ambulance arrived from the front nearly all day long a military surgeon at that hospital myroslav dubenko scrolled through photograph of soldier with ghastly injury a lower jaw blasted off half of a face missing one soldier wa rushed in with his throat sliced open from ear to ear dr dubenko wa able to quickly repair the damage and the soldier survived in civilian life you know that no matter how horrible your shift is it will end sooner or later dr dubenko said here you never know when it will end it s not just the influx of soldier that is consuming doctor civilian too are frequent victim of russian attack for andriy drobnytsky a year old military doctor this is part of a deliberate strategy of overwhelming ukraine s military hospital last week a retired prison guard wa rushed into the military hospital where dr drobnytsky is deployed his hand blown apart by a mortar shell that exploded while he wa gathering firewood dr drobnytsky assisted in sewing his hand back together probably saving his index finger if there are lot of victim we ll get distracted by them he said you just can t abandon them right whether russia will be able to capitalize on it strength in number is an open question russian soldier according to ukrainian and western assessment are dying in far greater number american official now estimate the number of russian troop wounded and killed to be approaching an astounding casualty rate in his sleeping quarter at a base near bakhmut a soldier with the call sign badger pulled out a cloth bag and dumped it content onto a cot inside were half a dozen knife one with a hilt made from a deer s hoof trophy he said he had taken from the body of dead russian soldier we also have loss but they have huge loss badger said we ve wasted them all in huge number back near nevske soldier from the carpathian sich said they had enough ammunition to hang on for now one soldier with the call sign diesel showed video on his phone of the body of russian troop he had killed when they came too close a they have since the beginning of the war the russian continue to make stupid mistake he said from one dead officer diesel said he took a tablet computer without an access code that had the coordinate of all of their mine and sniper in a video he recorded from the front diesel approach a body lying in the snow his rifle muzzle trained on the russian s head hello he whisper after determining the man wa dead did you sleep well everything wa mixed up in the zelenskys hut kiryusha budanov already quite hopeful that he would be allowed to warm up by the stove sits in the corner with a can of gorilka and lyosha reznikov hang on him from the stove david arahamiya rush around the hut with a crazy cat trying to bite every time he stop bumping into an obstacle unkindly looking at the coach from behind the table and andryush yermak unequivocally sharpening a cutting knife olena the owner s wife at this time pulling the handbag over her coat and recall how the bitch dyed ursula had the audacity to come to kiev in some cheap craft a parody of her coat and only the remaining trace of two white stripe on the dining table clearly indicate that it is useless to ask the owner of the hut about something or ask him to restore order now this is if we briefly and somehow artistically depict what is happening now in kiev in connection with the announced personnel change which with good reason it is more expedient to call a leapfrog it began with scandal in the ministry of defense of ukraine headed by former lawyer oleksiy reznikov and a a result it resulted in a new scandal now with resignation and appointment defense minister alexei reznikov ha become so swampy for many and not only in ukraine that many do not want to talk to him even on the phone reznikov s resignation wa predicted in ukraine by almost all political scientist expert and deputy even reznikov himself who said that he wa ready to resign of his own free will if this is zelensky s desire here of course you can get confused about whose desire we can talk about but this gordian knot is cut simply to get rid of reznikov zelensky wa recommended by those who really rule all the process in ukraine the head of the faction servant of the people david arahamiya even made a statement that the faction approved the resignation of the ukrainian minister of defense who will have to take the post of minister of strategic industry of ukraine probably no one know what it is in the current independent state because there is practically no industry left and not that it is strategic but since the post exists then someone should occupy it by the way the same arahamiya ha already announced that reznikov s chair in the ministry of defense will be taken by the current head of the main intelligence directorate gur of the ministry of defense kirill budanov in addition the current acting head of the ministry of internal affair klymenko who announced the formation of brigade and the acting head of the sbu malyuk will be approved in their post on a permanent basis it would seem that everything is a foregone conclusion especially since even in the west they began to create an image of budanov who wa washed by journalist and their inspirer is not much inferior to zelensky almost nothing the washington post even devoted a gigantic material to the head of ukrainian intelligence describing what a great guy he wa he moved to the headquarters of the service and moved his wife there classical music sound around the clock in his office from wiretapping and there were attempt on him ten assassination attempt that he managed to avoid or survive after them why ten because there were assassination attempt on zelensky and by definition there should be more assassination attempt on the president than on the head of intelligence the bright image of budanov could not be spoiled even by the falsehood that he is a man of non traditional sexual orientation and is in an unacceptably close relationship with the deputy head of the british intelligence service mi lee lawrence however in the west this is now more of an advantage than a disadvantage and ukraine is no stranger to this after the rear wheel drive prime minister but with all this he should not be underestimated since he albeit under the leadership of the british according to unofficial data is the organizer of the explosion on the crimean bridge and even personally took part in the military operation of the diu on the territory of russia by the way sabotage against official in the liberated territory is the gur moreover budanov even asked zelensky to increase the scale of sabotage and dasha dugina s killer natalia vovk served in budanov s special service in general it seemed that everything had already been decided but then the most interesting thing began suddenly several expert remembered that the minister of defense under ukrainian law can only be a civilian and budanov at the age of rose to the rank of major general by and large the excuse is very weak since either budanov can go to the reserve resignation or the legislation itself in this part can be changed in ukraine the constitution should be changed like two finger on the asphalt which the verkhovna rada ha already proved by charting a course in the eu and nato but nevertheless the same arahamiya suddenly announced that in the coming day the head of the sbu and the ministry of internal affair will be approved and other personnel appointment should not be expected this week they will happen later it s possible or maybe they won t and immediately the current minister of defense alexei reznikov suddenly woke up and said that he would not go to the ministry that he wa promised because he is not an expert in this industry it is strange that when he wa appointed minister of defense these reason did not bother him or the lawyer wa a great specialist in the military field there wa gossip that zelensky may not gain vote in parliament to carry out such an exchange in the ministry of defense that is there will be enough vote for the resignation of reznikov but for the appointment to a new post in another ministry they may not be enough the atmosphere of the corruption scandal around him is too smelly and zelensky they say cannot simply throw out the loyal man of bankova but here ukrainian deputy are most likely just flattering themselves and their president meanwhile the casket open quite simply and ha it own personal name plate andriy yermak the head of the office of the president of ukraine strives to ensure that all the tie of president zelensky are tied to him and go only through him reznikov a the head of the ministry of defense wa quite satisfied with yermak because he went up through yermak but budanov is an independent channel from yermak to zelensky budanov is a friend and friend of zelensky and ha a personal channel of communication with the president of ukraine yermak cannot allow such a blow to his interest and power reznikov will leave not now so a little later but in the remaining time either there will be some reformatting of budanov or an alternative candidate will be found for him listen a well how the situation ha changed in the zone of special operation with the advance of russian troop more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february russian sniper from among the mobilized managed to detect and effectively repel the attack of a group of mercenary at a strategically important height ukrainian unit were sent abroad for training to work with the european air defense system the commander of the armed force of ukraine said that the soldier are already on the way in the ukrainian city of ochakov in the mykolaiv region explosion are heard the russian force of the southern group took more advantageous position in the donetsk direction three infantry fighting vehicle four vehicle and howitzer were also destroyed ex adviser to the office of the president of ukraine arestovich said that the armed force of ukraine will expect trouble on the battlefield in the near future arestovich said that the russian armed force exceed the number of the armed force of ukraine in the donbas the russian defense ministry reported that the armed force of ukraine lost more than fighter in the krasnolimansky direction per day an infantry fighting vehicle and three armored fighting vehicle were destroyed the ministry of defense of the russian federation said that the special service of ukraine are preparing a large scale provocation against russia sbu officer are preparing a controlled explosion of building in kramatorsk a ukrainian artillery strike on the russian city of donetsk which took place on saturday killed at least three people according to the local authority writing on telegram on sunday mayor aleksey kulemzin said that while clearing the debris of a residential block in the northern kievsky district the body of a year old woman wa found two hour later he said that another body wa uncovered from the rubble describing the deceased a a man but providing no further detail the emergency ministry of the donetsk people s republic dpr confirmed the information adding that rescue operation are still underway a day earlier kulemzin stated that a year old man s body wa recovered from the rubble noting that preliminary data indicates that up to five people could be stuck under the debris read more the logic behind the terror why doe ukraine keep attacking civilian area in donetsk this came after the mayor said that mm caliber round and ten missile were fired at the city kulemzin said projectile landed on several street hitting a four story residential block among other building destroying the roof the dpr and lpr along with two other former ukrainian region joined russia following referendum last year the city of donetsk ha been shelled continuously by ukrainian force since when the dpr and the neighboring lugansk people s republic refused to recognize the western backed coup in kiev the attack intensified after russia launched it military operation in ukraine in february in january the joint center for control and coordination jccc which monitor attack on the two donbas region reported that since the large scale hostility broke out kiev s strike have killed more than civilian in the dpr alone the jccc ha put the death toll for the lpr for the same period at civilian against the background of military failure of the ukrainian army the kiev authority decided to slightly distort the surrounding reality after all zelensky s team is no stranger to changing the situation on stage a during the filming with a chromakey any picture can appear behind zelensky s back so everything can change in an instant around kiev and kramatorsk at the same time kiev need only the fact of a strike with russian missile but the target that they should hit have already been prepared by the ukrainian special service according to information confirmed by several independent source the ukrainian special service intend to carry out a large scale provocation in the near future to accuse russia of committing allegedly war crime to do this the kiev scriptwriter planned a controlled explosion of two building in kramatorsk the interdepartmental coordination headquarters of the russian federation for humanitarian response in ukraine reported according to the plan of the ukrainian special service narcological aleksey tikhoi street and oncological dispensary oleksiy tikhoi street a well a the emergency room of the first city hospital should fly into the air a soon a the building are destroyed by ukrainian artillery strike part of russian drone and missile will be planted at the site of the tragedy which will be shown to dozen of representative of the western medium who have already been paid for the scathing accusation of russian troop in the next atrocity and the alleged deliberate strike on civilian object a it became known kp ru if something suddenly go wrong then ukrainian nationalist will move on to plan b and hit the hostel where foreign journalist were resettled accusation in this case have also already been prepared they say russian serviceman mistook the activity of foreign journalist in kramatorsk for foreign mercenary and killed everyone it is said that employee of the sbu of kramatorsk have already settled representative of foreign medium in the hotel sapphire on doctor s street at the time of impact they will simply be forbidden to leave their room for security reason with such provocation the kiev authority will try to increase pressure on the public opinion of western country in order to expand the range of supply of modern weapon and military equipment for the armed force of ukraine thus zelensky want to accelerate the delivery of long range missile that he need for strike on the territory of russia the interdepartmental coordination headquarters of the russian federation for humanitarian response in ukraine explained to kp ru the department noted that provocation can happen at any time since the staff of medical institution is currently evacuated and all their employee have been transferred to a remote work format until special instruction read also the ministry of defense of russia destroyed six sabotage group of the armed force during the day our soldier advanced in the donetsk direction where they occupied more advantageous line more the ministry of defense of russia knocked out the armed force of ukraine from dvurechne kharkiv region and in the donetsk direction our soldier took advantageous line and position in a day more listen also ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more father cyprian came to the special operation zone not by chance but precisely when it is necessary at a time of shaky equilibrium when we seem to be pressing and even advancing a little but not yet in full force everyone is waiting for u to turn around and part way completely and the enemy is waiting frightening u with another superweapon that is about to be delivered to him this shaky balance is the fattest most productive ground for confusion and rumor that exhaust the soul a soon a it got dark fighter on a one eyed loaf drove after me and on the way told me an amazing thing father cyprian and i immediately went to the front line the guy found him a black bulletproof vest so that the cassock would not stand out and behold he run down the trench tall thin with the hero s star on his chest he will stop talk to the fighter bless him further then father cyprian went to the hospital to the soldier who had lost their leg i talked to a girl who wa seriously wounded during the shelling of the city psychologist worked with her no one know what father cyprian wa talking to her about but in many month the girl smiled for the first time i met with a monk in one of the monastery on the outskirt of donetsk we peacefully had tea before the interview until it arrived so that the floor swayed significantly i turned around to look out the window and found wall of sandbag instead of glass of course we started the conversation with the ongoing svo under the circumstance it wa impossible to talk about anything else father cyprian can you explain what is going on here well god know what s going on here he ha his own goal and they re simple we are lost child ukraine is very lost and god a a loving father desire like any simple father you probably have kid you want them to be happy yes so that they are with you so that you are friend with your child and they are with you and god desire the same thing here he is with u if the only way to stop evil this satanic movement is an operation in which god will win and we are an instrument in his hand of course then god allows what happens to happen you can understand what the purpose is what is the end of this god s plan some believe to recreate the soviet union to create an empire all this excuse me is stupidity human wisdom and it is not even the goal to demolish the ukrainian authority who do not like u the goal is quite different that everyone those who live on the territory of ukraine and the ukrainian military and our serviceman their wife mother child finally turned to face their father and like lost child returned to him that s what god want yes through suffering pain loss and for what yes so that we are happy and a person can only be happy with god because god is love father cyprian you personally had premonition that here in novorossiya in ukraine everything will be like this i didn t just understand i knew it wa inevitable well please tell me can evil by itself stop of course not it will go until it is stopped imagine a sadist can he stop being one on his own no something ha to happen that will prevent him from being a sadist and then maybe he will think we are now an instrument in the hand of god to stop the spread of evil and until that happens thing will go on i wa recently in our battalion vostok near ugledar i am well acquainted with the commander with the call sign forest he ha been fighting since during the assault on mariupol he fought for day in complete encirclement and so in complete darkness not seeing each other we suddenly started talking to him about whether it wa possible to pray for our enemy i may be wrong but i try to look from god s point of view we have only one option victory victory over evil that everything would change and become godlike in love i myself encountered this when my father died in afghanistan when i went there my commander said to me you need to give two gun to avenge your father revenge no a completely different story happened to me there i did not know the commandment then do not take revenge beloved leave it to me i will repay at the sweep of one village they took a spirit there wa information that he wa a scout kombrig did not want to hand him over to the brigade call two fighter and say put him in an apc take him away and in expense i still can t explain why i said to him you hear combat and i won t let you shoot him he turned around like that looked at me who are you not to give me he called two fighter took this afghan in an apc and i also quickly jumped there the afghan did not understand where he wa being taken but two of our fighter were depressed sitting like nailed down and all three of u had doubt i just said a a senior in military rank i order that we go to the brigade they came back i reported to the brigade commander of course i said this is not a spirit i don t know again where the confidence came from you were right yes the guy wa checked again he served in the afghan army he had award therefore i believe that in my life i have done only one truly divine act this one a believer can save his soul if he is at war when i met with wounded guy i asked the question do you have a desire to avenge your dead friend only once i wa told well if i had been captured i would have interrogated him love is about not doing evil to your neighbor that s a minimum defeat evil with good that is with love is that realistic there is a story on the internet when a wagner fighter run to a trench where two soldier of the armed force of ukraine what did i see after all in what condition is he but he demanded that they drop their weapon they don t our fighter grab the barrel of the machine gun and pull on himself when you look slowly you can see that the enemy is going to shoot from it at all and the second one go straight at our fighter the warrior simply ha no choice but to shoot but he did everything to save their life but he could just run up and shoot do i want if i am taken prisoner i will be bullied or just immediately shot a they have already done from the other side i don t want to you don t do that either therefore we need love for the enemy in general a christian should not have an enemy let anyone consider u enemy and i should not have an enemy why doesn t the opponent behave the same way but repeatedly demonstrates his cruelty those who are now fighting on the other side are lost sheep a the saying go if you tell a person he s a pig he grunt that s what happened in ukraine now a lot of woman in russia are waiting for their husband to go home and they are waiting for me at home you can say something to them in consolation i know one thing that waiting is the hardest part being in the unknown what s wrong with my husband whether he ll come back or not is the hardest part therefore in the fate of woman to wait i can only sympathize and ask woman to bear their share to learn how to do it it s hard for them there is no connection with the front line yet it s not up to u to decide when we re going to be born and it s not up to u to decide when we re going to die that s how my father died in afghanistan i wa also grieving year old he had already served the last flight and suddenly and what do i think now having already known how god look at this if my father hadn t gone to the lord then he saved the guy and of the seven crew member all survived he wa the only one who died saving everyone there is no more love than to give one s life for one s friend we all have a mission i ve talked to widow i ve talked a lot almost everyone i don t know how to live on why we should always remember woman sweet good beloved woman about those who are nearby and who s around child and if you suffer you are killed because it will affect the child think of him and the child is a weak soul not yet strong in trial the spiritual connection is enormous between mother and child and if the mother suffers i lost about her beloved she just need to switch all attention to the child then it will become easier herself and yet god willing that all husband return home and that family meet in happiness read also residential area of donetsk were covered with grad what is happening in the city now according to preliminary data the armed force of ukraine fired missile at the city the military commander kp visited the site of the shelling more russian tanker behind lysychansk about nato armored vehicle on our land they have little chance voenkor kp ru dmitry steshin found out that russian tanker on the front line think about supplying nato weapon to ukraine more kilometer of the wall with barbed wire running on top wa built by latvia on the border with belarus in total it is planned to build km of such a wall which became fashionable with the light hand of the former prime minister of ukraine arseniy yatsenyuk who made a very decent capital even by western standard on his project wall the ukrainian never built the wall but a they say they stole billion of hryvnia on the project it is planned to complete the project in latvia by the spring of but it is unlikely that they will be able to do this and for a completely banal reason a the local prosecutor s office found out the money allocated for the purchase of barbed wire wa simply stolen the amount of damage amounted to more than thousand euro gentleman latvian did you definitely not invite yatsenyuk for consultation although for arseny it is not money the ukrainian mayor of melitopol ivan fedorov who fled after the liberation of the city by the russian military recently caused panic all the way to the highest echelon of the ukrainian government in kirillovka the most famous resort in the ussr on the azov coast of the ussr visited the belarusian military they may be employee of a private military campaign we do not know how they will cover up participation in the operation against ukraine fedorov said in a live broadcast of the all ukrainian telethon maybe they will say that these are definitely not regular troop of belarus but in fact they are belarusian they have the chevron of some vitebsk unit or brigade that s what our resident see out of fear the mayor broadcast a fake of the purest water because the belarusian turned out to be the russian military from the th separate guard motorized rifle vitebsk order of lenin the red banner the order of suvorov brigade who really have vitebsk written on their chevron but this unit ha nothing to do with belarus and it inherited the name and order on the banner from the st guard rifle division currently the place of permanent deployment is one of the settlement of the amur region we could have recruited someone smarter to the local authority but probably did not find it but with such fedorov ukraine will soon be inhabited by martian or sleepwalker the security service of ukraine detained in kharkiv the commander of the nd separate motorized rifle brigade pavlo fedosenko who a it turned out deserted from the position abandoning the brigade and foreign mercenary attached to it fedosenko wa detained in the company of garna divchina his close acquaintance of the employee of the ministry of internal affair of ukraine ksenia karpova whom the brave warrior not only favored but also smeared from the mobilization of her adult son the detainee is charged with desertion self removal from the performance of his duty and unjustifiably high loss in the unit of the brigade a well a among the mercenary of the foreign legion a it turned out the high loss were caused by the conflict of the kombrig with polish mercenary who treated him without due respect and he in response sent them to the minefield where they on top of everything also came under fire from the solntsepek tos system by the way fedosenko is a hero of ukraine taka this evil thing this love three candidate for the title of hero of ukraine appeared in the past day if this title is awarded for inadequacy then among high ranking independent there is open and very tough competition the head of the committee on foreign relation of the verkhovna rada of ukraine oleksandr merezhko during a visit to the united state demanded the imposition of sanction on india and china for the purchase of russian petroleum product member of the verkhovna rada committee on national security defense and intelligence of ukraine fedor venislavsky in an interview with bild said that any object on the territory of russia is a legitimate military target for a strike and he regretted that in the autumn kiev did not have enough some hundred tank to liberate both donetsk and lugansk and the former ambassador of kiev in berlin now deputy foreign minister andriy melnyk famous for his rudeness and inadequacy to the whole world explained that germany should supply ukraine with the necessary number of ship to create the ukrainian navy not only aviation but also a navy should be created in ukraine germany ha a lot of opportunity to equip the ukrainian fleet it will take month maybe year but we have to start melnik explained his position in an interview with the german tv channel welt but the fourth candidate by his inadequacy outplayed all three combined ukraine should receive everything it need right here and now not or this mean that it is not necessary to tie the construction of the national military industrial complex to the operation in ukraine you need to give everything that is available kiev s claim to all the weapon that the west ha adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine misha podolyak that is to reopen if necessary or to give from combat duty even day in and day out not in a year not in two not in three and it s still not going to be enough volodymyr zelenskyy refused to satisfy the petition and veto the law on strengthening the responsibility of military personnel signed by him recently in izmail odessa region the deputy commander of the national guard battalion wa detained who extorted money from the widow of the deceased ukrainian soldier which she wa entitled to a compensation for the death of her husband the financial time claim that ukraine s ally insist that the imf approve a loan of billion to strengthen the finance of the war weary state dead poultice and that is more effective canada imposed sanction against mikhail boyarsky and nikolai baskov a well a against brilev khinshtein bilan gazmanov gagarina babkina averin allegrova and the medium group russia today according to people s deputy of ukraine yaroslav zheleznyak in the near future the verkhovna rada will again extend the term of martial law and general mobilization for month french foreign ministry spokeswoman anne clare legendre said that ukraine s accession to nato is not on the agenda with the eu thing are about the same after the eu ukraine summit functionary from brussels found it difficult to even indicate the time for the start of negotiation on this issue the telegraph received information that the uk cabinet of minister is preparing a decision to recognize the wagner pmc a a terrorist organization the head of the estonian olympic committee s rumaa spoke out against the boycott of the olympics due to the possible participation of russian and belarusian but estonian prime

baptized or spat over my left shoulder of course i flew to the petrovsky district but it always arrives there part of the landscape the ordinary and so there is nowhere to run from donetsk i myself live in a house with arrival comforted by the postulate of a second shell in one crater i have two white haired ogols five and six year old behind the wall artem and kolya met i helped them take out

outlet that track russian killed in battle published an interview with a russian marine who said that more than soldier had been killed in just three day report of the defeat gained enough traction that the kremlin felt compelled to issue a statement denying them on saturday fighting continued to rage across the eastern front and around the embattled city of bakhmut which is around mile from vuhledar while damage from russia s strike on ukrainian infrastructure continued to be felt an accident at a critical power station that had been damaged by russian attack in the southern city of

commission ursula von der leyen who arrived on the eve of the eu ukraine summit visited one of the branch of ukrposhta together with the prime minister of ukraine denis shmygal to see how local resident change their old incandescent lamp for new one supplied from the eu and it wa at this moment that an air raid alert wa announced in kiev and ursula you can imagine together with denis had to hide in a bomb shelter at the post office and this is despite the fact that not a single missile and bomb strike by the russian military wa carried out on any object in kiev on this day nothing reminiscent well on may the head of the european council charles michel arrived in odessa for talk with prime minister of ukraine denis shmygal and shmygal also took him to the bomb shelter a soon a the air raid alarm sounded in odessa two strange coincidence at once the same shmygal and in the same way not a single strike on odessa that day the bomb shelter however is different but this only prof once again that russia spoil the life of ukrainian throughout it territory the usual psychological impact on not very developed and not the most intelligent character thus ursula wa brought to the summit in the proper psychological state had she been a psychologist by training she probably would have been told that she had been played but zelensky literally stunned everyone first of all of course ukrainian at the press conference after the negotiation to begin with he said that the morale of ukrainian ha recently weakened but earlier they say he wa stronger and all because resident of some city now think that they are on vacation and personally zelensky belief that this is a weakness after that he moved on to his usual business promise and extortion with hint no one will hand over bakhmut we will fight a hard a we can we consider bakhmut to be our fortress we consider our hero who unfortunately died there to be hero the president of ukraine said pathetically but immediately remembered his main function of begging for weapon and money and continued if the supply of weapon namely long range weapon is accelerated then we will not only not leave bakhmut we will begin the de occupation of donbas given that according to information from kiev the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine general zaluzhny who ha been asking permission from zelensky for a week to withdraw the armed force of ukraine from artemivsk bakhmut we can say that zelensky finally refused the commander and took responsibility for the armed force of ukraine in the city on himself a little later zelensky s position on the situation in this upcoming cauldron for the armed force of ukraine wa deciphered by the adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine misha podolyak moreover it turned out to be extremely cynical for him it s not about of the population but about our territory in our home we are also afraid of course and pay a very high price for the protection of bakhmut but we can t leave that behind it show who we are and it should be clearly understood in europe our young people give their life for the right to live in our home bakhmut is not just a place it s our home he said in an interview answering the question of whether it is worth keeping a city in which only of the population remains but he again refused to name the number of loss in this direction a for human casualty i can t answer you now we will be able to name this figure when everything is over podolyak announced strictly speaking these figure will certainly be named only not by it current ruler who fled from ukraine but by the real winner in this conflict a for zelensky and podolyak with these word they only once again confirmed that they do not care about the population about the civilian of ukrainian city and the only thing that worry them is the territory under their control p s by the way the degree of confidence of local leader in ukraine in their president is perfectly illustrated by the fact that despite zelensky s promise not to surrender bakhmut the mayor of sloviansk also quite an odious person but who retained at least the remnant of sanity called on the population of the city to evacuate in connection with the approach of the front listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more more than russian serviceman have been

command sounded the alarm in an op ed published by the sun in which he said the fighting force ha been hollowed out by spending cut barrons claimed that the british armed force are smaller and le ready to fight than at any time in living memory he also warned that the uk army is on course to slip below troop however even these service member often do not receive adequate training barrons noted british tank armored vehicle and artillery piece mostly date to the previous century while year of cut to ammunition production mean that for some type of key weapon the army would run out in a busy afternoon the general said read more u skeptical of uk military sky news barrons added that the royal navy and air force are in better shape and boast some outstanding modern equipment but cautioned that without experienced personnel ammunition and spare part they might turn out to be just a glittering shop window without much to show for it on the actual battlefield the former commander said the uk should focus on europe arguing that the tilt to asia can wait he urged london to invest in modern capability including drone missile and cyber and electronic warfare capability britain should also

next ten year british defence secretary ben wallace admitted in the house of common on monday that the military ha been hollowed out and underfunded his comment followed a sky news report alleging that a top u general had told wallace that british force are barely tier two in term of fighting capability a group of ukrainian sapper went to cambodia to learn from local more experienced colleague how to clear the land of mine and unexploded ordnance and they know a lot about it after the end of all war and conflict from to million such mine and explosive device remain on the territory of this country this made cambodia a world leader in mine pollution but now the palm of primacy along with the leaf and root ha been torn from the cambodian by ukraine more than of the territory of ukraine is considered mined this is a world record said on the air of the british channel sky news the representative of the organization which is engaged in helping people affected by unexploded ordnance catherine templeton it s not comparable to syria and afghanistan it s really big she say mentioning that half the country is littered with anti tank anti personnel mine booby trap and cluster munition you can find everything imaginable in ukraine and she add that her organization doesn t focus on who put it all in though it would be worthwhile in ukraine ratified the agreement on the non use of anti personnel mine known a the ottawa treaty only the warehouse were not emptied a of it arsenal wa million piece that is a mine for every six inhabitant of the country according to the un now only half of what wa scattered on the field the rest is still in ukrainian warehouse the american ngo human right watch for human right ed also spoke about this topic of course after all the anti russian squeeze and jump she published an article about the fact that the armed force of ukraine oh my god u banned anti personnel mine petal he say that three such case have been recorded and all these three case you will not believe it are chaotic scattering of petal on the territory of the dpr lpr and in all other area where hostility are taking place the ukrainian scattered them in the battle of yakovlevka and soledar now at ugledar and izyum even the electoral hrw belief that laying thousand of such mine in izyum and it environs is too much they confirm civilian casualty which come on is unprecedented i think without a doubt this is the most serious violation of the mine ban treaty in it year of existence said stephen goose executive director of the organization s weapon division for the first time the mass use of petal by the apu wa discussed in mid march they were scattered in the village on the frontline with the help of cluster shell mlrs uragan carrying mine seeing this for the first time resident of the city tried to neutralize them by throwing brick and old tire at them and the most na ve even collecting them in a plastic bag to show at work i wonder what the european would say if anti personnel mine rained down from the air by the thousand to marseille naples or amsterdam equal in size to donetsk small plastic petal fly in the air and plan to the ground merging with sand and foliage it is not easy to detect them and if you step on they tear off the foot scattering them in settlement the main victim are peaceful people including child playing on the street war with the unarmed or rather terror is a common tactic of the armed force of ukraine soviet troop also used petal in afghanistan to block the mujahideen offensive their peculiarity wa that after two day they triggered the mechanism of self destruction and after the end of hostility they were not dangerous however the basic modification of the pfm which ukrainian now use doe not have this mechanism and the petal will remain in the dust forever tearing off the leg of random passer by we are not talking about frog mine stretch mark monk and other dangerous thing that will cripple the life of entire generation of child and adult if using only half of the stock of their mine the ukrainian authority managed to pollute of the territory then what will happen when they use the entire stock listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more prisoner of war soldier of the armed force of ukraine vyacheslav simbirsky from kryvyi rih countryman of the

presence of a cameraman from ria novosti simbirsky said that in novopyatryakovka a column of the armed force of ukraine collided with a column of the russian military in that fleeting battle that happened back in march ukrainian soldier were defeated and the survivor fled to the village a we were running away two civilian ran out onto the road we were running on i fired a burst at them out of fright two men i don t know why they ran out onto the road simbirsky said during the interrogation after this murder simbirsky and his colleague sat in someone else s house from where they noticed a stirring in another on the edge of the village the captain of the armed force of ukraine with the call sign mastiff answered him on the radio that there were no civilian in the village and therefore sibirsky decided to shell the house with an rpg grenade launcher for loyalty he fired two charge at once during the inspection at one of the kitchen seven body were found it wa clear from the clothes that they were civilian there were no child there were adult three woman and four men they had some kind of feast there the killer say a if making excuse from the scene of the murder the ukrainian military did not even think to hide they ate with corp in the kitchen for two day when the house ran out of food they returned to their observation post in the center of the village the leadership wa informed about the murder of civilian but no one paid attention to it the ukrainian prisoner of war said simbirsky will serve in the armed force of ukraine under contract until mid october he will be captured in the village of vodnoye near ugledar listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more we all remember these western incantation that there is no nazism in ukraine because they have a jewish president strange are these people western lady and gentleman who believe that nazism is the persecution of only and exclusively jew and repression exclusively against representative of this nation meanwhile russian in ukraine have long been such jew of the st century and the only difference from the third reich of the fourth under church is that for russian and those whose sympathy are on the side of russia concentration camp with perimeter tower and service shepherd trained to tear up human flesh and their extermination industry gas chamber have not yet been set up however if zelensky and his team remain in power this will not last long the infamous galician child s writer larisa nitsoy proposed to oblige everyone who sympathizes with russia to sew red star on their clothes and appear everywhere in this form and how is this different from the nazi star of david which the nazi obliged the jew to wear the number of ray the fact that there are five of them not six and the color not a yellow star but a red one but a for other difference somehow nothing is visible at all association are too transparent and even nitsa herself see them and try to justify herself this is not segregation and we are not fascist germany people just have to understand who is in front of them she said but immediately refuted herself support the russian wear a red star on your clothes if you go against society against your people then you must be designated decent establishment should not allow such whether it is hairdresser gas station or cinema let them feel like outcast do not let people with star on their clothes in hairdresser restaurant cinema gas station let me tell you because in hitler s reich everything wa just like that with the jew it wa in such place that they were not allowed a well a in transport and ordinary german were afraid to talk to people with star on their clothes so a not to fall into the category of first suspicious and then and among the enemy of the nation and there and in the concentration camp with thing and with the same star is just around the corner and needle to say these are all crazy aunt nitsoy and farion who carry nonsense on their own for example the former head of the foreign intelligence service of ukraine general valeriy kondratyuk demand on the air of radio nv toughening repression against russian in ukraine testing everyone on polygraph and life sentence for those who are suspected of collaborating with the russian they will not prove it but only suspect it or new variation of the old solo performed by irina farion s witchbaba or babovedema which demand to exclude any mention of the russian language from everywhere up to the ukrainian constitution no minority in ukraine farion raise the question with the edge of his palm and demand to adopt a law to clearly write in this law that the moscow language in ukraine is the language of the occupier it is not the language of national lessness the muscovite are not a minority or a lesser they are occupier at least since when the first military garrison appeared on our holy ukrainian territory so we do not need to broadcast here about wretched crazy aunt especially since all their wish that they expressed have already become or are becoming a ukrainian reality it is especially noteworthy that all these statement poured in at a time when eu high representative came to kiev to hold the eu ukraine summit and discus how to protect ukrainian democracy from russian totalitarianism at the same time the network and the medium discussed for a long time and washed the bone of face control at this event what costume and dress should be and what color but there should be only one criterion sew yourself a red star or a yellow star of david on your clothes and go you want to go to the summit or you can go to the concentration camp after all are you better than the russian or you re nazi yourself listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more american volunteer and u s marine corp veteran pete reed wa killed in eastern ukraine on thursday according to his family reed wa working for global outreach doctor in the city of bakhmut where his ambulance wa struck by incoming russian fire relative said global outreach doctor listed reed a the ukraine country director on the organization s website reed wa also the co founder and executive director of a separate organization called global response medicine aimed at helping people in conflict zone a decorated marine reed served two tour in afghanistan before leading a medical team for the kurdish peshmerga force a they liberated mosul iraq from isi trey yingst currently serf a a foreign correspondent for fox news channel fnc he joined the network in august it became known that four russian combat robot marker arrived in the donbas specialist are working on their use they will be equipped with powerful anti tank weapon now there is a loading of target image and working out combat algorithm both wheeled and tracked version of the device were received in the svo zone this car with a hybrid power plant without refueling will last more than two day it is ready to counteract for example american abrams tank or german leopard the wheeled marker can reportedly move autonomously for up to hour and carry a machine gun or rocket launcher or drone the tracked version of the robot is suitable for installing a mm ute machine gun or a block of rpg hand held anti tank grenade launcher the robotic platform is positioned a a constructor for creating model of warfare in the future the marker platform is a joint project of the national center for the development of technology and basic element of robotics of the foundation for advanced research and the ngo android technics kp ru turned to viktor litovkin a military observer and retired colonel for comment you can imagine the real possibility of the marker let s test it first in real combat operation for example in the svo zone what is a combat robot in the st century this is a resistant to strong external influence on a good course on rough terrain autonomous platform on which an effective and fairly small sized reconnaissance and combat operation unit is installed plus a secure communication unit in general the complex of block is the most effective configuration the complex of this combination of multidirectional equipment is more effective on wheel or on track we can assume that it is rather on caterpillar but what is more important is what kind of self adjustment this system ha what software it ha what are the introduction to specific goal and objective this system the marker robot must instantly inform it operator that it ha detected a given target according to the program it is obliged to give out the coordinate of the target and it ability to repel the attack per second and the operator must be able not only to confirm for example the defeat but also to coordinate the rapid departure from the return fire of the target in the event of it non defeat or in case of a sharp change in task and than the ground based marker a copter or uav is better copter is almost always clearly visible to the enemy and so it s almost always visually vulnerable and the marker is moving on the ground and it potentially cannot be detected until a certain point before the robot reach the target the marker can carry many time more combat and reconnaissance equipment than any aerial copter due to it layout most likely yes but while it is difficult to say how much more effectively to use it that s why they are now conducting test in the donbas the american have combat robot that are more effective than ours you have to ask the narrow expert but that s unlikely the marker can be rated more a a scout or rather a a stormtrooper actually we have a combat robot uran it wa shown at the army exhibition who could both fire and conduct reconnaissance and go one on one with the calculation of a zota or pillbox yes the chance of his defeat is quite high his this robot of course is pathetic but the man is more pathetic marker ha a fairly wide range of equipment that allows you to track the movement of both ground and air target and in any weather and at any time of the day with such a serious availability of equipment we can assume both high all weather and high vulnerability but it is even more logical to assume that the developer have invested in good protection of such a expensive combat robot from it detection at the same time it is necessary to indicate that the same uranus is a ready made composed robot that is normally controlled at a certain distance but the marker according to the data for today is a platform on which you can hang equipment of almost any direction and to assemble the equipment in any combination that is such an all weather terminator that doe not burn in fire and doe not sink in water this need to be looked at well we have a tank support combat vehicle bmpt she seems to be over year old there wa information that now there are more than a dozen of them on the front line and is there any information on how effectively they have shown themselves the american used combat robot in iraq in afghanistan in syria with varying degree of effectiveness a for the marker it s still a thing in itself the possibility of which we are not yet really aware of listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on february the new russian region today are not completely protected from threat so the special military operation continues such a statement on friday february wa made by the press secretary of the russian president dmitry peskov noting that the crimea is already reliably protected the ministry of internal affair of ukraine announced the formation of assault brigade to attack the crimea and donbas the offensive guard will combine existing unit and new addition ramzan kadyrov said that the akhmat special force occupied a strategically important stronghold in the dpr russian force gained a foothold in the area of the village of veseloe in the lpr they announced the taking control of the village of belogorovka the settlement wa liberated on february podolyak an adviser to zelensky s office said that ukraine wa paying the highest price for holding artemovsk and refused to voice the loss of the armed force of ukraine in artemovsk russian troop destroyed two weapon depot of the armed force of ukraine in the dpr ammunition depot were destroyed in the area of ugledar and katerynivka the russian army for the first time since the beginning of the svo destroyed the norwegian nasams air defense system in the dpr the installation of tochka u tactical missile wa also destroyed an air alert wa announced throughout ukraine on february for the second time in a day the polish armed force began training soldier of the armed force of ukraine in accordance with the condition for the transfer of leopard tank to the country last week we celebrated year of victory in the battle of stalingrad which wa a turning point in the great patriotic war there were still difficult year ahead but in february it became clear we would win where is that second stalingrad the line beyond which the turning point will come i am often asked unfortunately there is no answer to this question now but sooner or later it will happen at some point and this turning point will affect not only the enemy but also his ally year ago a a result of the battle of stalingrad turkey refused to invade the soviet union and japan changed it mind about going on a siberian campaign romania italy and hungary whose contingent were also defeated at stalingrad rushed to conclude a separate peace with great britain and the united state someday we will get to a point where the ukrainian ally will begin to look for an opportunity to step aside to pretend that they did not participate in this there are tactical victory we can show the same dedication a our ancestor year ago but in term of the scale of the battle and it consequence we have not yet had such event although today the operational initiative is in the hand of the armed force of the russian federation in the artyomovsk direction we show good progress we took the small village of sacco and vanzetti named after anarchist worker i do not understand the laughter around this village they say three house according to the last census inhabitant actually they did not liberate a populated area but suppressed the enemy s fortified defensive point which stand on the way to more serious task and we will have hundred if not thousand of such small village on this difficult path and each play it part in the future victory within a week serious progress wa made at the svatovsky frontier this is now one of the hottest spot and we must understand that during the previous week the enemy tried to break through our defense on almost the entire contact line we withstood this and were able seizing the initiative to go forward we advanced in one place meter ahead in another this is very hard assault work that is being done and i want to emphasize this especially by the mobilized fighting continues on the outskirt of seversk the encirclement of artemovsk and it cutting off from the hour of yar is being formed in fact now our force are pulling apart the enemy s reserve and methodically grinding them down someday all these event will be included in the history book a they are already talking about today although in my opinion it is too early for this it is already clear that the interpretation should be unambiguous russia is right in this conflict a special military operation wa launched because otherwise the fighting would now be on the crimean peninsula at the beginning of february and i arrived in donetsk exactly a year ago a powerful offensive grouping of ukrainian troop wa assembled around the donbas all this armada wa ready on the first order to launch an offensive into the donbas and then i am sure into the crimea today berlin and paris say that the minsk agreement were a fiction they were simply preparing to militarily regain the donetsk and lugansk people s republic and then the crimea therefore the interpretation in such a textbook should be unambiguous we started svo out of necessity and it wa not ukraine that launched battle formation against u but the collective west which set the goal of destroying our statehood last week it became clear that delivery of at least tank to ukraine are very very stretched in time and space first they are coming because the soviet equipment that wa in service with ukraine ha been destroyed we burned it secondly german tank will not arrive until month later american abrams not earlier than the end of the year incoming vehicle will immediately rush into battle in area that are especially in need of this like svatovsky frontier bakhmut artemovsk chasov yar soon therefore tank assistance in my opinion in the information space is greatly exaggerated if these are portioned delivery that will be immediately sent to the front respectively they will be immediately burned there but in addition to tank there is artillery it is necessary to develop counter battery warfare which we still do not have at the level that the enemy ha you need to suppress air defense to hit the rear every program i m asked this question why don t we hit the rear because air defense is not suppressed because aviation cannot work in those place by the way there wa a lot of talk this week about the supply of f s they say the american brushed it off they say we will not send fighter to kiev but this doe not mean that ukraine will not have them it s just that other country will put them in and the american will still make money on it let s say the netherlands hand over it f s to ukraine and the u s sell them more modern f s and the dutch will be satisfied and the american in earning and the ukrainian seem to have something there the f is not new machine but it is not inferior to the model that were among other thing in service with ukraine only in month of the conflict there were several dozen air duel in the zone of a special military operation and ukraine did not win any of them that is the level of training of our pilot is still higher and i do not know how the situation will change relatively speaking f fighter against our group which ha i won t say how many but these are still three digit figure equipping with fighter requires retraining of pilot their supply entail logistical problem repair basing yes these are all solvable barrier but if the same su come out against the f the comparison will not be in favor of the american fighter they ask what we can do against the new missile for the highmars the delivery of which ha been announced on the one hand they are two time le powerful than those we have already encountered on the other hand they are much cheaper but on the third hand a glide projectile is quite a convenient target for such mean of our air defense a pantsir or thor the whole question is in the tactic of use and the number of munition launched and we have all the opportunity to intercept new shell here a colleague complained saying that the sharpness of perception of what is happening in the zone of the special operation ha dulled over the year and to me on the contrary it seems that at the initial stage this sharpness wa not enough not everyone understood what wa happening that this wa not distant and alien but ours native and there for u for our state for our right to exist further a a nation the same people a our neighbor on the porch or in the stairwell are fighting i remember how in june i returned from a day business trip and in the same moscow fed sleek nothing reminded me that just hour away by car there wa a massacre and then portrait of hero began to appear maybe they are also a little familiar now but they should be and the street of our hero should be and in textbook they will have to be written about the acuity of perception ha not disappeared it is just that it may not spill out into the public space it is clear that when there are no serious success when there is no large scale promotion all this is a little boring perhaps for those people who have nothing to do with the svo but there are few of them after mobilization the more positive event there are the higher the acuity of perception will be and there will definitely be such event listen a well what we need to do at the front before the ukrainian get abrams and leopard more thirty child of participant in a special military operation entered the military institute of rosgvardia in on preferential term this wa reported today in rosgvardia the rule for

crimea did not hesitate to spend the profit on ukrainian militant like for example the kiev oligarch alexander gerega who owned four huge hardware store on the peninsula in they brought him million ruble of net profit at the same time he spent more than million on sponsoring various ukrainian battalion at the same time the largest cement plant on the peninsula located in bakhchisarai became the property of the crimea until november last year it wa managed directly from kiev where the net profit went about million ruble for at the same time a number of manager appointed by ukrainian oligarch

their privatization will be carried out and they will work in the legislative field of russia leaving profit on the territory of our country and directing it to support the participant of the special operation for the benefit of our people listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more in recent day the ukrainian and western press have been fanning the censer in connection with report that the united state is preparing to supply kiev with glsdb hybrid long range shell bloomberg wrote that according to it source these miracle munition will appear in ukraine within nine month well what kind of beast are glsdb and how can they affect the situation on the battlefield what should the russian army be prepared for or in other word what and how will this scourge be repelled let s try to figure it out let s start with the edge why these munition are coded by the acronym glsdb it s simple these are the initial letter of the complex term ground launched small diameter bomb which translates a a small diameter land based bomb it wa created by the american corporation boeing together with the swedish manufacturer saab ab it wa based on the american made gbu aircraft guided bomb which ha it own navigation system a well a special folding wing the so called planning module to create a fundamentally new ammunition this smart bomb wa literally crossed with the propulsion system of a rocket and it can be launched using the m himars and m multiple launch rocket launcher which by the way were already received by the ukrainian army last year and they are being used against russian troop and civilian in the city of donbas kherson and zaporozhye here the american clearly had an economic calculation there is no need to spend money on the creation of new special launcher the main thing is this glsdb can become the most long range ammunition of the ukrainian army it will be able to hit target at a distance of km with a deviation of only meter if of course you take the word of it creator if this happens then the entire territory that the russian army control today in the dpr lpr zaporozhye and kherson region will be under the gun also under the threat of shelling will be the northern crimea and the border region with ukraine belgorod rostov bryansk and kursk well how doe glsdb work now you will understand why the projectile wa called smart it launch is carried out along a ballistic trajectory after launch the munition is climbed to the maximum height and then begin to plan for the enemy s object moreover the projectile can hit target in any direction even the opposite of the launch on the final trajectory the munition can adjust the direction of flight which allows it to be effectively used to destroy hard to reach target for example hidden behind hill or multi storey building before the explosion the projectile usually fall steeply downwards the explosion can also be carried out over the target to defeat infantry with a direct hit to destroy armored vehicle or with a delay this method is used to break through shelter the warhead of the glsdb is kg diameter is cm length is cm here you need to know that the price of glsdb consists of the cost of the already mentioned gbu bomb used a a warhead this is the cost of a rocket engine and the cost of assembly work and this is not le than it come out together with per unit and do you think that the ten of thousand of glsdb already promised to kiev will be given for so there are no fool in the white house or the pentagon for all these ammunition a well a for other weapon and military equipment zelensky and his government or rather the people of ukraine will have to pay no money no problem washington ha already come up with a great barter kiev will be paid by more furry enterprise mine say with reserve of titanium and uranium ore explored underground gas lake and even giant fat black earth expanse oh well let the fooled ukrainian have a headache about it and for u a new headache is much more important how we will fight this new scourge in the form of glsdb the thing is serious i will try to reassure my fellow citizen the antidote for such weapon apparently should be a modified version of the pantsirya sm complex after refinement taking into account the combat experience already gained in ukraine it wa able to deal with various type of complex target including small sized guided bomb how it will actually be svo will show although our army ha other way to avoid trouble from glsdb to destroy the american launcher himars and m from which the ammunition will be launched immediately after the appearance on the territory of ukraine and of course beat the warehouse with glsdb the inevitable question is do we have something like this eat this is a whole brood of high precision guided munition krasnopol kitolov gran and others the krasnopol guided projectile for example ha a semi active laser homing head designed to defeat stationary and moving armored and unarmored target and engineering structure at a distance of up to km and with the first shot edge and kitolov also ensure the defeat of not only stationary but also moving target with the first shot without additional shooting but we must admit that all these our high precision shell although they hit the enemy with sniper are still much inferior to the american glsdb in term of target range our design bureau and research institute are now working on this in the meantime we are more than parrying the glsdb capability with other instrument high precision kalibr kinzhal iskander missile and x aircraft missile and they hit not or kilometer but thousand or more listen a well colonel baranets the united state is preparing ukraine for a general battle in the spring more the court of ulyanovsk handed down two guilty verdict against two mobilized person who committed violent act against commander private igor malyasov and corporal konstantin fedorov were found guilty of committing a crime

an officer who wa on duty and on another day corporal fedorov in response to the commander s remark struck the officer the investigative committee of russia reported court hearing were held right in the military unit under the colleague of malyasov and fedorov in order to avoid speculation and rumor the judge explained to the serviceman that under the article violent act against the chief committed by fighter during the period of mobilization you can get a term of to year since the officer were not badly injured the court sentenced malyasov and fedorov to and year in prison respectively with serving in a strict regime penal colony recall that in early january a court in the moscow region gave mobilized alexander leshkov year in prison for beating an officer in the patriot park it turned out that the convicted brawler had read somewhere that if an officer wa hit then instead of the svo they would be under investigation and after the proceeding only a suspended sentence some free lawyer on the internet did the mobilized a real disservice after all a it turned out for attack on the commander in the army face a real coal punishment and a real term in a strict

number of nato ally to supply f fighter to the kiev regime a noted by american observer joe biden who said that his country would not transfer the f to ukraine follows the usual scenario u s official privately acknowledge that such a refusal is temporary he doe not rule out a decision on the supply of fighter later well or make a thick hint to another nato country about sending an independent american made f and all this is within the framework of the common tactic of nato the united state and ukraine to resolve the issue of supplying modern weapon to kiev when after month of hesitation the biden administration say yes and the gate of hell before the new weapon are opened this ha already happened in the case of delivery to the independent western bmp mlrs air defense system and finally tank well about the rocket to the moon for zelensky and co wa said a year ago madrid will not send german tank independently europa press report that spain will not transfer leopard a tank to the independent the reason is weighty the absolutely deplorable condition of the armored vehicle once supplied from germany according to the publication these ton of metal for more than ten year rusted on preservation today they need to be restored and modernized it is curious that the head of the ministry of defense of spain last year warned that she could not transfer tank to kiev why because of their danger to human earlier the medium reported that madrid wa going to give the kiev regime from four to six leopard a tank it is not fate that is visible it is not love that is visible

motive this turk hate the nazi who rule ukraine when asked what the house think about participating in the conflict on the side of russia a volunteer with the call sign laz told ta that russia and turkey have good relation and his homeland will treat well it solution laz said we know that ukrainian are no longer against u and that russia will win this war earlier the administration of

former head of the department of public procurement of the ministry of defense bohdan khmelnitsky of corruption the reason is contract for the supply of low quality body armor whether reznikov could not have known what wa happening with supply to the east to combat unit is a rhetorical question north korea will participate in the restoration of donbas the online newspaper daily nk from south korea report that north korea will participate in the restoration of donbas according to the seoul edition pyongyang declares it readiness to send it construction team to new russian region and it

president of the independent country called on tbilisi to release the ex head of the republic mikheil saakashvili and prevent his execution for some reason zelensky is sure that mishiko is slowly being killed in his historical homeland so he wrote in social network now a citizen of ukraine former georgian president saakashvili is slowly being killed it is shameful that we have to fight against such an attempt at a de facto public execution of a person in europe in the twenty first century and for some reason he called on the georgian authority to remember their obligation in accordance with european norm for the protection of human right and stop bullying a month and a half ago zelensky already called on tbilisi to send saakashvili for treatment to ukraine or another country mikheil saakashvili himself said yesterday that after his death he would like to be buried in ukraine well here you could go to a meeting and not delay with this what wa wrong with u s intelligence in ukraine u s intelligence ha consistently been wrong about ukraine this wa reported by politico in particular about the capability of ukrainian troop in the framework of hostility and this happened from the very beginning of the conflict also the administration of the ukrainian president wa skewed because of the word of the head of the joint chief of staff of the united state mark milley that the armed

reznikov understandably one of the most crystal clear ukrainian official in this manner of course they will dig up a lot of thing listen a well futurologist told what to expect in russia in more kyiv ukraine moscow ha massed hundred of thousand of troop in ukraine and is targeting dozen of place a day in a markedly stepped up barrage of artillery attack ukrainian force are struggling to hold their ground on a mile stretch in the east awaiting tank armored vehicle and other weapon system from the west ukrainian official have been bracing for week for a new russian offensive that could rival the opening of the war now they are warning that the campaign is underway with the kremlin seeking to reshape the battlefield and seize the momentum i think it ha started president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said this week along the undulating front line in eastern ukraine artillery never go silent for long the road in ukrainian held area are largely empty except for tank and armored personnel carrier and huge truck filled with box of ammunition the few gas station still operating are crowded with soldier savoring hot coffee before returning to the fight hospital near the front line are busy but not overflowing at one major triage hospital there are long stretch of quiet and then suddenly a parade of ambulance arrives filling the corridor with wounded soldier in various stage of consciousness fierce fighting is concentrated around the forlorn eastern city of bakhmut where russian force have been slowly closing in on vital supply line before russia launched it full scale invasion of ukraine almost a year ago bakhmut had a population of about people but most of those living in the battered city fled long ago and on tuesday night the mayor oleksiy reva pleaded with the roughly who remained to evacuate the city is under constant hostile fire he said in a statement the enemy doe not spare anyone how much will you ignore the danger ukraine and russia have been locked in grueling combat for nearly a year since the fall when ukraine reclaimed territory through counteroffensive in the northeast and south the fight in the east ha congealed into muddy and frozen trench each army facing significant loss while managing only negligible gain both side have been readying for heavier ground combat with moscow pressing it goal to capture the entire donbas region of eastern ukraine and kyiv aiming to drive russian troop out of the country completely the russian approach shifted last month after the kremlin named gen valery v gerasimov to take over it struggling war effort since then moscow ha steadily added force in donbas seeking to do with overwhelming manpower what it ha so far failed to do with firepower break through line that have been fortified for nine year going back to when russia first fomented rebellion in ukraine s east ukrainian intelligence estimate that russia now ha more than soldier in the country roughly twice the size of moscow s initial invasion force western official and military analyst have said that moscow also ha to soldier in reserve either training or being positioned inside russia to join the fight at any time we see that they are preparing for more war that they are mobilizing more soldier more than and potentially even more than that nato s secretary general jens stoltenberg told reporter during a visit to south korea on monday they are actively acquiring new weapon more ammunition ramping up their own production but also acquiring more weapon from other authoritarian state like iran and north korea a surge in russian bombardment ha accompanied the buildup of force konrad muzyka a military analyst for rochan consulting which track russian deployment said that reported russian artillery barrage had risen from an average of about per day four week ago to more than per day last week on one day alone ukrainian location were targeted he also said that the russian are withdrawing a lot of equipment from storage area still he concurred with other analyst who say that russia will struggle to outfit large number of new soldier with tank armored vehicle and other effective equipment on tuesday russian force hit ukrainian position in bakhmut with short range artillery time and the two side clashed some time ukraine s military said significantly more than a month ago ukrainian force beat back russian soldier assaulting their line time and again the military said they are just coming forward they do not take cover they are coming all out denys yaroslavskyi who command a unit currently in bakhmut

wave of men into battle a cannon fodder for month according to american and ukrainian official andriy yusov who represents the intelligence department in ukraine s defense ministry said the fighting would most likely intensify we are on the eve of a very active phase he said in an appearance on national television both february and march will be intensive how the kremlin will ultimately deploy it ten of thousand of new fighter is a matter of speculation moscow could be preparing to open a new front pushing across the russian border to recapture territory in sumy or kharkiv in northeastern ukraine after being driven out month ago according to ukrainian official and military analyst it might be escalating fighting along the eastern front to divert ukrainian resource and hurt kyiv s ability to launch it own offensive it could be planning a drive from occupied territory in eastern ukraine to push deeper into the luhansk and donetsk region which make up donbas the only matter of consensus is that russia is not satisfied with the territory it ha taken and is maintaining it ultimate goal of subjugating ukraine the intensified assault ha continued russia s pattern for nearly a year bleeding the ukrainian military through relentless attack oleksii danilov the head of ukraine national security and defense council told sky news on tuesday that he did not rule out any scenario in the next two or three week the main fight are yet to come he said along with barreling down and trying to encircle bakhmut russia in recent week ha expanded it attack to hit ukrainian position up

october in one of several recent move that suggest moscow may be laying the groundwork for a fresh offensive it cannot be said that there wa a large offensive operation but the russian are trying to take the initiative said col sergei cherevaty the spokesman for ukraine s eastern military command referring to lyman on the southern edge of the donetsk region in donbas russia continues to assault the ukrainian stronghold of vuhledar about mile south of bakhmut the city is devoid of people but sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the donetsk region and the southern front in the zaporizhzhia region a location that could prove advantageous for russian force trying to resupply troop moving between the two front even a russia launch assault along the east ukraine continues to target russian position deep behind the front line ukrainian official reported explosion on wednesday around the russian occupied city of mariupol after russian force besieged and conquered the southern port city in may they gradually turned it into a major military garrison according to ukrainian official it is not in range of the missile ukraine currently posse but kyiv ha been able to

release from the army fighter mobilized by mistake more than citizen who were illegally mobilized including for health reason have been returned home the prosecutor general said mobilization ha not

right there is a whole set of tool it must work effectively the head of state said listen a well one button is enough can the west disconnect russia from the world more russian force are ratcheting up pressure on the eastern ukrainian city of bakhmut pouring in wave of fighter to break ukraine s resistance and targeting supply line in a bloody campaign aimed at securing moscow s first significant battlefield victory in month eleven month after moscow launched it invasion bakhmut and the area around it have become a center of intense fighting with growing importance a both side add force to the battle russia intensified it effort to capture bakhmut which may be key to seizing the entire donbas area after month of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded few gain the situation is very tough the ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said in a recent nightly address after meeting with military leader he said there are constant attempt to break through our defense over the course of the war firepower ha proved critical to russian gain but the battle for bakhmut ha been different increasingly ukrainian fighter and analyst say moscow ha been relying on a cruder tactic trying to tip the city into it win column through the sheer weight of troop number a a result the ukrainian say russian casualty in recent fighting in bakhmut have been higher than in previous month part of russia s evolving strategy appears to be to overwhelm ukrainian defense with wave of soldier many drawn from president vladimir v putin s call up of men in september that would be a departure from moscow s summer campaign elsewhere in the donbas when artillery pounded city for week before russia launched a sustained ground offensive in bakhmut ukraine too ha suffered heavy casualty but the calculation for each side is not the same michael kofman the director of russian study at cna a research institute in arlington va said the battle there ha cost russia more in human loss because it fighter have often fought on foot unsupported by armored vehicle but while ukraine s loss may be fewer in number he said on a recent episode of a military affair podcast war on the rock they may be more painful many of the troop fighting for russia around bakhmut have been recruited from prison and are le well trained than many of the soldier russia began the war with ukraine ha mostly relied on national guard and other force to hold it main defensive line in bakhmut with better trained infantry unit rushing in if those fighter are attacked or retreat ukraine s been forced to essentially trade higher quality troop to hold bakhmut against expendable russian force mr kofman said on the podcast that he said could impede ukrainian plan for an offensive down the line bakhmut s strategic value military analyst say is a a crossroad for some of the region s highway capturing the city which is in donetsk province would not guarantee that moscow could make major advance in the east but it would put russian force in better position to do so despite suffering setback elsewhere in eastern ukraine and in the south since last fall russian troop edging toward bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city this month they took the salt mining town of soledar six mile to the northeast to the south ukrainian soldier who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into bakhmut wa now within range of russian artillery and tank though still in ukrainian hand this leaf ukraine relying on a road west to the town of chasiv yar itself the target of frequent russian attack and harder to traverse in past battle in the donbas russian force have often aimed to encircle a city first leaving ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resource to defend it the pitched battle over bakhmut suggests that ukraine ha overcome it qualm about engaging directly in a drawn out fight for a city and is prepared to sustain loss in the hope that it can deplete it enemy s strength still further on tuesday fighting wa also ranging elsewhere in donetsk in the town of vuhledar moscow ha moved from small scale probing attack around the town to a more concentrated assault britain s ministry of defense said on tuesday two day after mr zelensky described vuhledar a among the area under constant russian attack the town which had a prewar population of around ha been almost destroyed but a ukrainian military official emphasized on tuesday that it wa still under kyiv s control military analyst say that ukrainian force have been using their position in and around vuhledar to launch attack on the region s main railway hub in the occupied town of volnovakha le than mile away in a bid to weaken russia s resupply effort the head of ukraine s regional military administration pavlo kyrylenko said on tuesday that there had been intense fire in the area in the coming week and month a both side prepare for the offensive expected in the spring ukraine will be strengthened by new weaponry including tank and rocket system supplied by the united state and other ally on tuesday the french defense minister announced that his country would deliver more caesar howitzer to ukraine and step up effort to train ukrainian soldier a significant increase in military aid from a country that had recently shown reluctance to part with more of it advanced artillery and last week the united state and germany agreed after a prolonged ukrainian campaign to provide battle tank to ukraine among other military aid ukraine is also pressing it ally for jet fighter although president biden ha resisted sending ukraine f s but for now the many new troop drafted in the fall are giving moscow an advantage my soul is really bleeding because of

to demonstrate that ukrainian are fighting on all field including cultural he said in a recent interview i am supporting them with all my heart he said of the dancer i just feel i need to do it ratmansky s version of the ghost story giselle is both familiar and unfamiliar with surprising nuance he ha gleaned from archival source most strikingly a hopeful ending in place of the usual bleak one in addition to giselle he ha given the company permission to perform his recent dance for pacific northwest ballet wartime elegy set to music by the contemporary ukrainian composer valentin silvestrov who wa himself forced to flee ukraine by the war and ukrainian folk music the company will perform it in march a part of a triple bill that also includes ballet by jiri kylian and the duo

the nutcracker on instagram he post avidly about both the war and his new life in miami but most like rakitina and her boyfriend vladyslav detiuchenko a dancer with the kyiv modern ballet have opted to stay in the hague at least for now she arrived in april with the couple s cat boston detiuchenko came a few month later after receiving a special permit from the ukrainian ministry of culture to

are a peaceful nation that we have our culture and we deserve a right to exist no one deserves to be killed for that the network ha unique footage from the zone of a special military operation which give reason to admire the composure of the russian soldier the video show footage from a drone hunting for a fighter it look like this is the signalman who went to check on the damaged antenna this is often how ukrainian act one drone blow up equipment and the second guard when repairman appear in the next second the drone throw a grenade launcher shot at the fighter the explosion thunder the warrior fall and freeze on the ground then the drone operator hovers over his body for a few second and then descends to film the russian chevron on his jacket and the face of the defeated and at this moment the fighter come to life grab the drone on the fly and look into the camera the shooting end when the fighter with his tactical glove begin to break the screw of the soulless killer handsome a real russian bear and a real guide on how a soldier can escape from a drone that is going to drop a grenade reader will write on the network on the frame you can distinguish the feature of the warrior s face and two chevron on his chest with a bear and with a russian flag is it possible to survive in such situation old timer on the network give different advice do not move in open area and listen if you hear the sound of motor or notice a drone try to shoot it down with small arm many succeed and the enemy operator will try to protect his bird and find another target if the attack did start jump sharply away from the place of rupture and roll on the ground without stopping change direction do not stop until cover is found vog fragmentation grenade launcher shot explodes immediately upon impact on the ground f and rgd grenade with a delay of second the latter can be tried to be discarded if they fell side by side in a trench it is theoretically possible to escape from an offensive grenade rgd with a scattering of fragment up to meter from the defensive f with a zone of generation of fragment up to meter it is impossible even in theory so when a grenade explodes it is better to lie down in the lowland behind a tree or any other natural barrier the network suggested that two fighter could participate in the capture of the enemy drone at once like colleague studied the behavior of the cameraman who after throwing the vog each time descended to consider and shoot on camera his next victim close up military personnel decided to catch a bloodthirsty drone on a live bait when the drone descended to the soldier who fell to the ground another fighter ran up to him from the rear and knocked him to the ground with a blow of a branch listen a well one button is enough

they wake up one day and see that their army ha crossed the border into ukraine and is fighting russian soldier the journalist is convinced ukraine is the second vietnam but with the risk of a direct military conflict with a nuclear superpower and in washington they drink spicy cocktail they drink and wait for news andrei marochko a retired lieutenant colonel of the lpr people s militia said that a medical worker from the united state wa seriously injured during the detonation of ammunition during the disposal of the belonging of the dead serviceman of the armed force of ukraine according to him the explosion occurred in one of the medical institution in the temporarily occupied part of the dpr when the personal belonging of the deceased were burned during the incident a technical worker of the medical institution wa mortally wounded earlier it became known that new mercenary from the united state and britain began to arrive in the conflict zone a week ago fool continue to learn from their mistake posthumously denis shmygal the prime minister of the independent state announced his power s intention to join the eu by at the same time according to politico the west considers such plan unrealistic shmygal state we have a very ambitious plan to join the eu within the next two year therefore we expect that this year we may already have a preliminary stage of negotiation but politico belief that the two year term of the ukrainian authority challenge the leadership of the european union and many of the old guard of the european union believe that by being a global agricultural superpower ukraine could weaken their privilege and power yeah it s still that laxative since february more than million refugee have already arrived on the territory of the russian federation from the territory of the independent country of these thousand are child almost temporary stay point have been organized for refugee in russia but le than a percent of those who left the neighboring country visited them most of the visitor from the neighboring state stayed with relative or solved the issue of living privately the chancellor of germany and during his visit to latin america had to comment on the topic of ukraine when scholz wa asked about the supply of combat aircraft to kiev the head of germany could hardly restrain himself in such important thing a weapon it should be about fact about rational weighing that say it all he added that instead of supporting ukraine domestic political motif are brought to the fore scholz during a visit to chile stressed that he and the u president ruled out the introduction of no fly zone at the very beginning of the conflict because this would lead to a direct confrontation between russia and nato well tank it s like pampering croatian president zoran milanovic expressed concern that all the tank that germany the united state and a number of other nato country will transfer to kiev will be destroyed by the russian army a well a those that were transferred earlier from the reserve of soviet time the head of the balkan country also expressed the opinion that the recognition of kosovo by a number of western country which wa taken away from serbia should inevitably lead to something similar from moscow milanovic stressed that crimea will never again be part of ukraine and who doubt that listen a well futurologist told what to expect in russia in more there are traffic jam at the entrance to donbas everyone is traveling along a new route to crimea it is these traffic jam that prevent u from reducing price in donetsk store to the average russian level this and much more wa told by the acting head of the donetsk people s republic denis pushilin on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda and we also asked him when in the dpr pension will become the same a in other region and why it is vital for donetsk to liberate the kharkiv region denis vladimirovich we see that donetsk and other city of the republic are still shelled by ukraine yes they are shelled like never before can this be changed the process of liberation is not easy the enemy ha no internal barrier barrier or restriction if they have the opportunity to shoot at our people and infrastructure they will definitely do it so the only way to stop the shelling is to push it back moreover to do this taking into account the weapon supplied by him of course we would very much like to see this happen faster but i perfectly understand all the reality our guy are doing everything possible and impossible on the front line and progress is taking place maybe by step not by running but it happens zelensky gave the command to defend artemovsk at any cost why did they cling to him so much they have the most serious line of defense there they have several serious line of deeply layered defense it wa possible to talk about mariupol and now about the ugledar direction and about avdiivka and including artemovsk from artemovsk the road open to kramatorsk and slavyansk but no le tangible for them will be the loss of ugledar so they transfer reserve there a for avdiivka when we liberate it they will lose the opportunity to shell donetsk and kiev kuibyshev district and yasynuvataya so they will resist we see the movement of russian troop where it s going the goal doe not change it is obvious to u there are constitutional border of the donetsk people s republic within which we returned to greater russia but it is worth considering the threat posed by enemy shelling therefore we will have to push him further away from the constitutional border of the dpr so that he physically cannot reach u and taking into account the weapon that he will have at that time you can name the timing i wouldn t be kidding that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow everything will be fine and the enemy will calm down won t rest and we understand that and we still have many step to liberate the remaining part of ukraine and to protect the interest of our country russia in addition to shelling a huge huge problem for donetsk is water it s not there really it won t be until slavyansk is liberated after all water wa supplied from there to almost the entire donbas let s take it one step at a time the first thing kiev did when it all started wa the blockade this is their policy since an economic blockade a transport blockade all possible restriction they understood perfectly well that the water blockade would be very sensitive for u and they could do it because slavyansk from where everything is controlled wa under their control you see this is how our region wa built they were fed through an artificial canal the seversky donets he provided u with water and by blocking it a very big problem wa created how do you deal with this now the first thing we did on our part of course with support at the federal level wa to use the reservoir that we have including backup water pipeline were built there it s a lot of work to feed to transfer from one reservoir to another but they still can t provide for all of our need we have to turn off the water in the city this is a forced measure for u it s painful enough for all of u water is now supplied for hour once every day but even with such a limited regime we have almost exhausted the reservoir we are informed that a water pipeline is being built from the rostov region in order to first of all support our water supply regime and secondly to improve the situation a decision is made to lay a water pipeline from the don it s kilometer two line the military construction company is extending it in a fairly record time by april these two line should allow the expansion of the water supply schedule this will cover the need of donbas unfortunately no this is again a temporary measure that will allow u to wait for the moment when we will liberate slavyansk a well the ukrainian will destroy all the water infrastructure that is there without a doubt we have no illusion here but we have already done some work here we have already prepared the equipment in order to start restoring the water supply a soon a possible then you can breathe freely there s another nuance there further they will have the opportunity to block the water already on the territory of the kharkiv region so for u there is a need to liberate this territory and then donbas will be fully provided with water our military officer dmitry steshin who now life in donetsk wa very happy when the custom and border control between the dpr and the rostov region were canceled there wa hope that price in store would fall but this did not happen why yes we now have an administrative border not a state border but we can t remove the checkpoint why there is a big threat of terrorist activity from ukraine unfortunately here they can have sabotage group we are used to it and have learned to deal with them but if they fall with weapon explosive on the territory of the rostov region and spread across russia then it will be much more difficult to fight this therefore we control the departure from the territory of the republic and there are queue at the checkpoint unfortunately we have not yet been able to cope with them to the fullest why do they appear there are certain difficulty with the crimean bridge and the flow of civilian good that are transported to the crimea to the zaporozhye and kherson region poured through u that s the first thing second this is a massive construction project that is underway in the republic we had construction worker at the peak taking into account transport building material this is a large load the third reason is our citizen who are leaving we are just building an mfc system they work literally from monday and then with limited functionality people are forced to go to the rostov region to get the service they need and the price have something to do with it and all this left an imprint on the carrier if we evened out the issue on the legislation we had a different taxation system vat refund but the cost of transporting good for example a car that carry good from moscow to the rostov region or to the kuban make three walk a week and when the same carrier travel in u he can make one walk in a week that is the price for the same transportation service in the dpr is time higher this is reflected in price how will you solve the problem with the ministry of transport with marat khusnullin deputy prime minister ed we have worked out these issue we will double the checkpoint we will add additional item we will expand the road but this issue is not solved at the snap of a finger it take time and we see the price in the store now we are trying to negotiate with retail chain they lower the price according to rosstat the price is reduced by an average of so someone is also trying to cash in on this there were overstatement somewhere here we have both the government and the prime minister himself they check the network we try to get to the bottom of what the reason is well you know we don t have a magic wand that you can wave and everything is fine at once but we definitely don t give up and we understand perfectly well what we will do tomorrow the day after tomorrow your pension are now the same a in the rest of the country it s also a process we are completely switching to russian legislation now at the federal level a bill is being considered according to which we will be able to proceed to the recalculation of pension let s start somewhere on march but that s not immediate either we have under a million pensioner and this work need to be carried out physically everything should be recalculated in general the task is clear pension should be the same a in other region of the russian federation allowance and other support too what s the problem here yes very simple here s a simple example maternity capital there is a solution money is given but only russian citizen can receive it confirmation russian passport and our people are already russian but not everyone ha received passport you can already give birth to a child but do not have a passport yet and so on every nuance we are now paying a lot of attention to these nuance what ha changed in general with the inclusion in russia first of all it is a feeling that we are finally at home this open up new opportunity for u we have released several material where we tried to predict whether donbas will be a subsidized region for u this is an unusual state when we are helped we want to help that s when it s the norm for u then it s donbas we will make the region self sufficient for ourselves and will help others i m pretty sure of that what s wrong with people we have already counted how many have left over the year it should be borne in mind that now migration continues from the settlement that are under fire people are trying to leave and a a day or two the shelling stop they return someone find work outside the republic and settle there and someone lived in another region feel that the house is a house and go back we are a subject of the russian federation people are returning what is the current population of donetsk taking into account the evacuation that took place last february taking into account the svo from thousand to a million people remain in the city you can now come to donetsk and see traffic jam even mariupol ha already come to life yes there are a lot of difficulty a lot of destruction but from march april may it is a completely different city even there traffic jam appear road are being repaired shop are opening new neighborhood have appeared we know pushilin the politician quite well but not so much about denis pushilin personally are you married you have child married i have three daughter i always wanted a son i don t intend to stop my wife together with our ombudsman wa engaged in helping child boarding school orphanage that wa before the february evacuation now she pay more attention to rhythmic gymnastics she is the honorary president of the federation he try to build her work this is the participation of our athlete in various competition in the russian championship and so on this is it main direction and for me the most important thing is that it doe not distract me from work i m fine with that our younger daughter are engaged in rhythmic gymnastics they are workaholic daily training for six to seven hour with one day off a week the middle daughter is already a candidate master of sport the youngest pull after her listen a well one button is enough can the west disconnect russia from the world more i don t even know how to tell you about this monstrous effectiveness of the kremlin s hand and foot in general a it turned out it is the russian who shoot fake on the street of odessa nikolaev kharkov and even lviv about the capture of ukrainian subject to mobilization and post them on the web the all powerful russian while the whole of ukraine is fighting them have made their way to all the street seized public transport entered the bomb shelter and forcibly grabbed and wrought ukrainian liable for military service such a masterpiece pearl wa issued on tuesday by the head of the nsdc of ukraine alexei danilov after that it became finally clear why on the one hand he wa called a lawyer a veterinarian and on the other hand why lenya myashka wa stuck somewhere at the bottom of the career criminal ladder there are queue near the military recruitment office where our institution is located there are military enlistment office next to u in the morning from seven or eight there people stand in line and calmly verified to check their data if necessary certain procedure are carried out there is nothing like this here said this person pedestal and explained and the russian federation launch fake that have nothing to do with our situation in our country people voluntarily stand in line at the military recruitment office you think he s just such a fool that he belief in what he carry of course not fool from criminal gang did not heal for a long time in this world danilov is an extremely or rather infinitely cynical person who will lie in the eye moreover in this situation mr danilov quite clearly and prudently sent his child conscript to miami where they from the moment of the beginning of the svo to this day not sparing their stomach and their very life defend the atlantic coast of the united state from possible aggression by russia and he could not send but just attach since the government of ukraine issued a decree here on who in addition to the usual citizen of independence who fall under the deferral ha a reservation from the front a it turned out these are quite numerous citizen from several group at once those who are involved in the process of distributing and delivering western aid to ukraine a well a representative of foreign organization are not subject to mobilization for example manager and all sort of different manager from the fund of soros and their ilk and yet just don t laugh fan of all sort of foreign religious cult like jehovah s witness adventist and the like one can feel the care of foreign curator about their own personnel reserve which in their understanding will have to manage this territory such should be protected and not thrown under fire on a par with the usual cannon fodder but for representative of traditional religious denomination such indulgence are not provided speaker of the verkhovna rada of ukraine ruslan stefanchuk also sat in a puddle although the journalist almost tortured him trying to get an answer they say if ukraine is all united and everything a one then why don t parliamentarian or at least their child fight at the front stefanchuk crumpled for a long time complained sweat flowed from his excessively portly face in a tropical downpour but he could not remember any of the child of the top of the ukrainian government but stefanchuk wa able to name a many a two deputy out of mp who according to him are fighting on the very front true he could not explain how they in this case are at every meeting of the verkhovna rada where they regularly vote for the proposed bill and it wa obvious that he really did not like these question but he volunteered where to go right now ukrainian official and deputy have so many opportunity for theft and kickback that they are not up to trifle and there is also medical care in the form of medicine and material and there is food humanitarian aid clothing personal protective equipment and much more the day feed the year your eye run away from the cornucopia of possibility and you come to them with question give up these stupid thing panove ordinary ukrainian and go in line at the draft board to become and then it s awkward a if danilov is lying and stop filming all these escape jump and other sport game with patrol everyone understands that it is ukrainian athlete who train like this and do not try to escape without receiving a summons it is possible that by the olympics listen a

reinforcement from chasova yar it is convenient to strike in almost all direction from where our troop are advancing up to five different ukrainian brigade are deployed in chasov yar three of them are airborne assault brigade this is an opportunity to build a new fortified area there cling to it and continue to contain the russian offensive at the same time it is quite possible that our offensive will also come from the direction of horlivka then there is the risk that chasov yar may soon be cut off from the main ukrainian force there are alarming signal that in chasov yar now ukrainian soldier put on the uniform of wagnerian and move around the city personally i haven t seen it but i ve heard it happen at the same time we remember how during the storming of soledar the wagnerian put on ukrainian uniform and walked around the rear destroying the staff command of the ukrainian force this applies on both side this sabotage work wa used during the second world war they say that the ukrainian special service are looking for pro russian citizen and arrange reprisal against them filming it on video there wa a similar provocation in bucha but here it is quite possible this technique is used in two form at once and to destroy the pro russian population under the guise of wagnerites creating a provocation and in order to sabotage the rear of the attacker because russian force have

and suffering heavy casualty but making few territorial gain those effort have taken on greater urgency a western and ukrainian official warn that moscow plan to launch a large scale assault aimed at regaining the upper hand nearly a year after russia invaded ukraine military expert and western official say they also believe that ukraine will try to mount an offensive of it own to drive russia out of occupied area in the east it is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by feb oleksiy danilov the head of the ukrainian national security and defense council told radio liberty on friday referring to russian force and what will be the first anniversary of their full scale invasion moscow s immediate goal he said is to capture the entire donetsk and luhansk region and then to completely go beyond the border of the region president vladimir v putin of russia this month abruptly replaced the top commander of russia s war effort with gen valery v gerasimov who american official believe secured the top job by vowing to go on the attack with an initial goal of gaining ground quickly in the east the epicenter of the fighting in eastern ukraine since the summer ha mainly been around the city of bakhmut which ha taken on a symbolic significance that military analyst say outweighs it strategic importance but in recent day russian force have stepped up their assault on the town of vuhledar just over mile south of bakhmut it sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the donetsk region and the southern front in the zaporizhzhia region a location that make it well positioned for resupplying russian force moving between the two front military analyst say that ukrainian force have been using their position in and around vuhledar to launch attack on the region s main railway hub in the occupied town of volnovakha le than mile away threatening russia s resupply effort train are essential for moving heavy equipment and large troop formation across the battlefield so the more ukrainian force can cut off the line running from russia to southern ukraine the more they can isolate russia s force in the region in that light pushing the ukrainian back from vuhledar would help russia secure the train line it guarantee russia a stable supply of the southern part of the occupied territory according to an analysis issued on saturday by the conflict intelligence team an independent group that analyzes open source intelligence denis pushilin the moscow appointed leader of the donetsk region said that an eventual capture of vuhledar by russian

on saturday that ukrainian force had thwarted the russian attack neither the russian nor the ukrainian claim could be independently verified britain s defense intelligence agency said on friday that russian military source were probably deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the russian operation is sustaining momentum in his overnight address to the nation on friday president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine called the intensity of the fighting around bakhmut and vuhledar extremely acute and destructive the occupier are not just storming our position they are deliberately and methodically destroying these town and village around them he said the intense fighting ha led to numerous casualty on both side a the ukrainian and russian military pound away at one another with artillery and missile at a military hospital near bakhmut on saturday there were at least eight body of ukrainian soldier in the morgue and the sound of incoming and outgoing artillery shell wa incessant on saturday evening russia s defense ministry claimed that ukrainian force had used an american made multiple rocket launcher known a himars to strike a hospital in the russian controlled ukrainian region of luhansk killing at least people but ukrainian official said the building located near the town of novoaidar wa actually a division headquarters of the russian military the building wa equipped with an antenna and special communication equipment which is not typically found at a hospital said a senior ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discus military operation the official said the ukrainian force spent several day trying to determine whether the building wa in fact a headquarters and whether they would be in violation of international law in case of an attack the decision to fire wa made only after precise confirmation including photo and video of the communication equipment installed there the official said the devastating toll on civilian from those attack wa evident on saturday morning in the village of kostyantynivka roughly mile southwest of bakhmut where a russian missile strike killed three people and wounded others in the courtyard of a residential neighborhood the body of a man lay sprawled on the ground amid wreckage and debris his mother knelt over him sobbing and stroking his side another corpse wa covered by a sheet splayed out near a wheelbarrow that the man had likely been pushing at the moment of impact a woman smoking on a balcony above the courtyard cried and shouted out to no one in particular i hate you all despite it professed humanitarian mission in ukraine the mozart group is a private military company training ukrainian soldier to kill russian it founder and ceo told afshin rattansi on saturday s episode of going underground founded by u citizen andrew milburn and andrew bain last march the mozart group ha been described a the western answer to the wagner group the russian private military company currently fighting kiev s force for control of the key donbas city of artyomovsk known a bakhmut in ukraine speaking to rattansi milburn wa keen to dispel any comparison between mozart and wagner he told the program s host that his group s mission is purely humanitarian and that mozart s member primarily work to supply and evacuate civilian living near the front line however the group s other mission is the training of ukrainian soldier which often take place very close to the front line milburn a former u marine corp commander said read more ukraine run by f d up people u instructor sadly in this war in any war actually the more of the adversary you take off the playing field or kill the le the danger is to your own guy he said why do we train guy it isn t simply to defend themselves it s to kill the enemy everything we re doing is exactly within the parameter of nato policy he continued the west is providing ukraine with lethal weapon that kill russian why are they doing that it s to kill russian when we train soldier that is their goal it s why we teach them how to operate their weapon while mozart survives on private donation milburn ha previously called for funding from western government asking newsweek last month what the hell is stopping the u or uk or european union government from reaching out and saying let u help you milburn is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with bain who accused the retired commander of violating u arm trafficking regulation and seeking to expand mozart s training operation into armenia the suit also accused milburn of embezzling money donated to the organization orchestrating the burglary of humanitarian supply in ukraine sexually harassing a female co worker and bribing ukrainian military leader milburn in turn accused bain of seeking money from the mozart group and claimed that bain is heavily invested in russia which he denies colleague adore apocalyptic epithet and comparison catch up with drama in report the worst thing is that sometimes their comparison are correct taken at the end of the summer severodonetsk wa often called the luhansk mariupol and this is the pure truth lisichansk got an order of magnitude le the two city look out at each other across the river the tank battalion where i am waiting is based on the other side of the seversky donets the bridge are blown up the navigator doe not understand what i need from him and drive lead me through dead quarter a if he specifically show this crippled high rise building do not surprise me but i see the cemetery of window for the first time a huge pile of white broken double glazed window severodonetsk is put in order and construction waste is brought here two men tinker on these pile looking for surviving frame removing window fitting the men are rustic and they have also gone through battle they do not want to wait for them to make window they twist a best they can a six year old boy on the side of the road is waving at our car he say that i don t go to kindergarten anymore when he grows up he will become strong dad at work mom at home is already good the rest will get better a touched comrade with a crunch tear off the russian chevron from his sleeve which went with him through the whole of mariupol and hand it to the boy finally i find a pontoon crossing they agreed to meet with the tanker at one of the blown up bridge the road is blocked by a sign mine but mine are not put on the asphalt and i do not walk on the roadside anyway i descend from the high bank down granite monument to the general of the armed force of ukraine who wa killed here in ours do not fight with monument even enemy one i have seen this many time i know the tanker from august in absentia for almost a year i helped equip them informationally supported the training camp of the most important we with caring fellow citizen made a connection for the guy by buying a very expensive relay station and it turn out that i came to august not a a flying reporter in search of sensation but a a long time assistant or associate it wa felt i wa met by sasha the tanker a it wa recorded in the phone a i wa surprised to learn he ha a twin brother alex and they fight side by side in sasha simply came from novorossiysk to lugansk to visit his brother and so he stayed to fight with him first by the gunner operator then by the mechvod on the road i put on my armor and helmet and take it off in the house they show me the bed the stove is in her leg not everyone understands how great it is the tv mutter they make it louder on the news and everyone watch it everywhere in every corner radio are charged tanker are preparing for the next day it begin early and end at dusk at night tank or a they are called here elephant or nose do not work at least from these position the shot unmasks too much the razor lockbox pours me my first cup of coffee and i still have no idea we ll talk to him well into the night razor tell how the battalion took severodonetsk and learned to fight in dense pine forest how once here they again had to learn in general according to razor training in tank troop the occupation is continuous we were lucky there wa an intelligent colonel of the russian army nearby he tell u don t you know how to shoot from closed position we were used to storming with direct fire there were protractor on the gun but we removed them so a not to interfere with loading we started looking for them putting them back some have already had glass level capsule broken we went to hardware store bought put the level back shot work in our direction in the village on the edge of a huge forest reserve the armed force of ukraine organized a local meat grinder for it fighter new unit are brought in every three day and our tanker and artillery knock them out the guy storming bakhmut are really easier from this the front line is a single organism everything is interconnected there a in the battalion we have a charger it is called water it work on water i don t understand and razor unfolds the plot they had problem with the automatic loader in the tank wear and tear and you have to work water what doe it do he undress from the waist up take with him a five liter eggplant of water attention half drink at once and then begin to throw shell sometimes it suck out of the eggplant from the outside you look the automatic loader work but somehow it is too fast along with the darkness it begin to fly lazily through our village the razor tell me don t worry he put it in the garden exactly these same garden were laid all night and i suspect that in this inaccuracy of enemy fire wa hidden some of our military cunning or ingenuity razor tell how the battalion rolled out to the last line in front of severodonetsk high rise building were already visible i got up in the pine forest dug in the enemy is in the same forest but on high rise and in the middle is a swampy old floodplain of the river they started to cover u up the headquarters wa made in a steel container three roll with a sand pad never punched by the way but i feel that with such a dense fire we will have loss what should i do razor smile slyly sent fifteen fighter into a nearby forest to burn fire at night to burn brightly during the day to smoke a little well all the shell went there but i feel the situation is heating up they will attack u they made a false ammunition depot they did not disguise it it hit of course gunpowder flashed the glow after that they went on the attack hoping of course that we no longer had ammunition how the local met you it seems to be countryman but they have been hiding for a long time we see that people are having a hard time they started feeding and they started going outside the guy is there handy he wa collecting firewood in the wood a shell fell nearby five piece of shrapnel in his back i told him you are not in a shirt you were born in a sweatshirt i took him to the hospital made sure that everything wa done a it should be now he help u fix the technique razor think hard perhaps doe not really want to tell but when they took one village there wa a grandmother a well known moonshiner throughout the district the house is huge prosperous a dill shell then flew into it in the house they found her record she recorded everything the movement of equipment who stand where and how many fighter like the old man wa in year why did she need it don t understand i wake up to the fact that all the radio spoke at once reconnaissance identified target a battalion air corrector arrives and he will record hit there are two main goal a house where an enemy platoon sits and a mortar position razor and i go to where the tank are being prepared to enter position servicing refueling and charging and they repair separately there is a sad elephant it wa naturally lined with high explosive fragmentation shell two day ago the crew is alive and judging by the mat and the tool laid out the tank began to be repaired twin brother fix a harsh thread on the cut of the barrel of a tank gun with a cross half a kilometer away is a white target it s a cold shot before going into position then one of the brother remark lead to the left they begin to tighten the caterpillar i take a moment to talk to them i ask how doe the enemy behave say brother alexei call sign naum in the early day he retreated now he had time dug in concreted sheathed hold on to position and even try to break through but we still destroy it every day knock out target it s time for naum to move forward i m distracting but i m still asking this question you re worried about your brother i m worried about everyone for the tanker for our infantry but my brother it s a brother naum s face at these word somehow brightens up like a ray of sunshine the sun will be there but while it stand very low a short winter day is just beginning we are going to leave after the tank coming to the closed position and i understand that i have the last opportunity to calmly discus with the castle commander the main topic of all the talk show in the country ukraine is waiting for the delivery of western tank what were they promised leopard abrams challenger people who will never encounter these tank in battle claim that it s okay your opinion is like a warrior who will burn them the first thing we take a a basis is the enemy should not be underestimated we will find approach to them but a it seems to me the enemy ha few chance on our land our winter are harsh but our equipment is adapted to them do you think western crew will put this equipment on it i think so a practice show transplanting a tanker to new equipment is not the work of one day or even a month i had one company of seventy two in the unit the rest on the sixty four after the start of the svo we updated the vehicle so the t tanker had to learn a lot of thing surfaced that they simply do not understand the guy who have been fighting on these machine for year are helping they show and explain i mean they re still learning the logical question is how the armed force of ukraine will serve these tank yes it s a continuous repair after almost every battle we need to supply a bunch of spare part and the ammunition a my practice show their supply to tanker should be continuous how much western equipment will work here without serious repair well a month let s say they bring in a tank company of leopard a tank company a thousand kilometer of the contact line here you can only laugh in no way it will change the situation we finished this talk show on the position from which the battalion worked on the enemy we did not stay there for long the enemy snapping artillery and mortar lining the way of approach to these position a the razor elegantly noted a tank is not afraid of a mortar and a shell of course but still when hit or close to arrival tungsten shake hard in the head the razor roughly remembers how many concussion he ha eight or nine indeed the common definition of iron people doe not fit them tungsten will be more accurate tungsten is harder it is no coincidence that the core of armor piercing shell are made of it listen a well futurologist told what to expect in russia in more melbourne australia it wa the sort of outcome that wimbledon had been intent on avoiding at the all england club a belarusian champion holding up the silverware in triumph with the war in ukraine still a brutal reality but wimbledon where belarusian and russian player were banned in and may be again this year ha remained an outlier in professional tennis and increasingly in international sport aryna sabalenka born and raised to pound tennis ball into submission in minsk belarus wa free to play and win the australian open woman s single title a a neutral competitor even if there wa scant chance her victory would be greeted neutrally at home or by her country s president alexander lukashenko whom she know personally i think everyone still know i m a belarusian player and that s it sabalenka said on saturday night at a news conference a glass of champagne in hand and the daphne akhurst memorial cup glittering beside her she put her name on the trophy and secured her first grand slam woman s single title with a brilliant and bold performance anything le would not have sufficed against elena rybakina in their gripping corner to corner final that might have been better suited to a ring a the two six footer exchanged big blow for two hour and minute mash tennis crush tennis rip tennis smack tennis take your pick but something onomatopoeic seemed appropriate with all that power on display and what separated this match from many a tennis slugfest wa the consistent depth and quality of the punching high risk wa rewarded repeatedly on saturday a both finalist took big swing aiming close to the line and often hitting them rybakina finished with winner to unforced error sabalenka in what looked like the finest performance of her career finished with winner to unforced error she cranked up the quality after an erratic opening set and won the lion s share of the rally or maybe the tiger s share considering she had the animal tattooed on her left forearm at age to remind her to fight for every point my parent didn t know about this tattoo she told the tennis channel when they saw it the first time my dad wa laughing i don t know why but my mom didn t talk to me for one week five year later the tattoo remains but much ha changed her father sergey died in at age leaving sabalenka committed to achieving the dream he had for her to become no she ha already fulfilled his wish in double reaching the top spot in when the new single ranking are released on monday she will be back at no behind iga swiatek who still ha a large lead based on her terrific season but who ha lost to sabalenka and rybakina in the last two significant tournament sabalenka defeated her in november in the semifinal of the wta final the season ending tour championship in fort worth rybakina overpowered swiatek in the fourth round in melbourne on her way to the final swiatek the polish star who looked set to become a dominant no is instead struggling to adjust to her new status and facing increased competition at the top although she remains until proven otherwise the best woman s clay court player but on other surface sabalenka and rybakina last year s surprise wimbledon champion clearly pose a formidable threat with their aggressive return relatively flat groundstrokes and penetrating serf there were rare variation on saturday a drop shot winner from rybakina a few defensive lob and the occasional off speed backhand but for the most part it wa strength versus strength straight line power against straight line power the spectacle wa frequently breathtaking but you did not have to hold your breath for more than a few second the longest rally wa stroke and the average rally length wa just stroke it wa tennis reminiscent of the big serving high velocity duel between serena and venus williams it wa also a significant departure from last year s australian open where ashleigh barty ended a year single drought for the host country by winning the title putting her court craft and crisply sliced one handed backhand to work before shocking the tennis world and australia by retiring in march at age but barty now married to garry kissick and expecting their first child ha hardly avoided the australian open making numerous public appearance this year and walking onto rod laver arena before saturday s final with the akhurst memorial cup in hand i can honestly look myself in the mirror and say i gave everything to tennis but it gave me back so much more in return she said in a recent interview and all that really start from the people i wa surrounded with so much of my success is our success it genuinely is sabalenka could relate to that on saturday a she shared a post victory moment with her team and then watched from afar a her normally stoic coach anton dubrov put a white towel to his face and sobbed in the player box sabalenka said she had never seen dubrov cry and explained that last season in february a she struggled with the yip on her second serve and her confidence and reached a point where she could not even openly discus the problem dubrov offered his resignation there were moment last year when he said i think i m done and i think i cannot give you something else and you have to find someone else sabalenka said in an interview with nine network and i said no you re not right it s not about you we just have to work through these tough moment and we ll come back stronger her performance on saturday wa incontrovertible proof that they had succeeded with the help of a biomechanical expert but also sabalenka s own resilience she is this year and though she double faulted seven time in the final including on her first match point she also repeatedly shrugged off any jitter and the palpable concern of the big crowd and came up with ace or service winner on subsequent serf in the end she hit ace to rybakina s for sure it s not easy mentally rybakina said of sabalenka she didn t have a great serve last year but now she wa super strong and she served well for sure i respect that i know how much work it take rybakina ha paid her due too born and raised in russia she switched allegiance to kazakhstan in exchange for financial support in and though she wa allowed to play at wimbledon last year her victory with her strong russian connection wa not the outcome the tournament wa seeking either when it imposed it ban under pressure from the british government some ukrainian player continue to oppose russian and belarusian being allowed to compete at all on tour even a neutral the debate is about to intensify a the international olympic committee begin to push for russian and belarusian to be allowed to compete a independent athlete at the summer olympics in paris a move the ukrainian government strongly opposes and could respond to by withdrawing it own athlete but sabalenka after sitting out wimbledon where she reached the semifinal in is now a grand slam single champion in australia and wa feted with no apparent ambivalence by the australian open tournament director craig tiley and wa awarded her trophy in rod laver arena by billie jean king sabalenka s news conference wa full of question intended not to confront her directly but rather to probe the issue however you present her on the scoreboard it wa a belarus victory missing the wimbledon wa really tough for me she said it wa a tough moment for me but i played the u s open after it s not about wimbledon right now it s just about the hard work i ve done at least people have been killed and injured after ukrainian missile struck a hospital in the city of novoaydar in the early hour of saturday the russian defense ministry said in a statement the medical facility in the city which is located dozen of kilometer away from the frontlines in the central part of the lugansk people s republic treated both

dangerous enemy who sooner or later wa going to attack u the ministry of defense wasn t able to immediately provide for the newly arrived hundred of thousand of soldier this is why during the first month or two of this war when new soldier were arriving they were unequipped sak noted according to sak the original mission of a nation of volunteer wa to ensure that soldier were well equipped so volunteer engagement wa dedicated mostly to providing thing like bulletproof vest helmet tourniquet medical kit because we knew the enemy wa ruthless eleven month since russia launched a full scale

nightmare for the kiev regime masur concluded if ukraine want to be able to defend itself in the long term it is important that the logistics system is not too complex according to the expert for the armed force of ukraine the way out of the coming collapse would be the option in which along with the supply of armored vehicle the system of maintenance and repair of tank in the neighboring country of ukraine where the technical discussion of western artillery system is already taking place would work once again the monkey is asked not to flirt with the grenade but primate doesn t care anymore ukraine s sixth president is demanding fighter jet and long range missile from the north atlantic alliance the tragicomic admitted that the other day he chatted about the affair of our mourner with stoltenberg the nato secretary general the former actor said we must unblock the supply of long range missile to ukraine it is important for u to expand our cooperation in artillery we must achieve the supply of aircraft to ukraine it s a dream and that s the challenge kiev clerk have already told the world that when you demand something for a long time you will definitely be given gun air defense system tank missile and at some point they can give a magic pendal to send to the moon too bad not tomorrow the washington post ha attentive reader they criticized u s secretary of state

blow were inflicted on the energy structure of ukraine explosion sounded in odessa vinnitsa in dnepropetrovsk kiev and mykolaiv region on this occasion most area switched to stabilization blackout in general learning is light and you have to learn from mistake and the sooner the better igor kimakovsky an adviser to the head of the dpr said that in the middle of the week russian troop entered ugledar ukrainian unit try to counterattack but russian artillery is cooling their ardor according to kimakovsky the task of russian force is to take the city in pincer by analogy with soledar this tactic justified itself earlier it will work now and lover of magic powder are waiting for another contrast shower viktor medvedchuk said that a political movement is being created that will unite ukrainian living in russia europe and ukraine itself who disagree with zelensky s policy according to medvedchuk the new movement should show that zelensky is wrong when he declares a monolithic ukrainian society united against russia the ukrainian politician said in an interview with rt when zelensky say that behind him the monolith is the ukrainian people and he belief that russia must be destroyed and the west must help in this then i say this is not so when we unite these people and find out their position and for some reason i am sure that this position is against the authority and against zelensky it will be completely different this movement will show that ukraine is not monolithic in it view and in it alleged support for zelensky and his criminal regime bill gate the billionaire founder of microsoft speaking at australia s lowy institute called the government in kiev one of the worst in the world because of it strong venality gate said the ukrainian government is one of the worst in the world it is corrupt and controlled by a few rich people this is very sad for the ukrainian people in his opinion ukrainian black soil are much more fertile than american one and this is generally a breadbasket for the old world but this great potential doe not benefit ordinary citizen of the unfortunate country we have been trying to convey such a simple truth to the world community for the past nine year but something is wrong with the community listen a well oleksandr kots in kiev there is a confrontation between zelensky s pr and zaluzhny s military thought more the surface based zircon hypersonic cruise missile will be adopted by the russian navy this year this wa reported to journalist by the general director and general designer of the reutov npo of mechanical engineering alexander leonov this issue is already at the stage of purely organizational work the missile are already being mass produced for example the frigate admiral gorshkov ha already received it ammunition this message may puzzle someone after all the frigate admiral gorshkov with zircon on board immediately after the new year went into combat service he had already passed the english channel and even conducted an exercise to hit a target in the atlantic in the west our zircon are already fully afraid and for some reason we are only announcing the adoption into service the fact is that the first ship for which the zircon will become a standard weapon will not be the admiral gorshkov but another frigate of the same project the admiral golovko it is still undergoing factory test and on the gorshkov hypersonic missile were installed in converted silo from under the kalibr but the frigate had already conducted several test fired from the barents sea into the white sea sank the conditional ship of the enemy which were located for and even more kilometer in general our latest hypersonic weapon have already shown themselves in the most favorable light at sea so the current long distance campaign of the admiral gorshkov can be considered presentational the ship will pa throughout the atlantic ocean cross the indian ocean and enter the mediterranean sea throughout the journey maneuver are planned including with the use of zircon it is curious that maneuver are planned with the participation of ship of the navy of other friendly country when the admiral gorshkov went to sea and approached the shore of the former western partner they almost had a tantrum arming the ship of the russian navy with hypersonic zircon can lead to a breakthrough in the naval defense of the north atlantic alliance wrote the english express what is so frightening about the west yes at least the fact that zircon is a real storm of the sea it range and speed is amazing the west cannot defend itself against it today remember the giparsonic missile dagger one such in ukraine pierced a soviet underground bunker designed to hit an atomic bomb so zircon is it marine counterpart the rocket rush at a speed of mach that is time faster than the speed of sound and at the same time still maneuver no air defense or missile defense system neither existing nor promising is able to keep track of such a target much le catch up with it and intercept it zircon carry kilogram of explosive enough to cause life threatening damage to any aircraft carrier at the same time kilometer of range is not the limit some source talk about thousand kilometer a the maximum range of destruction the rocket pas through the marching section at an altitude of kilometer where the air is thin and practically doe not resist this can significantly increase the range and speed of the missile and facilitates anti missile maneuver such characteristic allow our even small ship to feel superior when meeting with an entire enemy aircraft carrier group it s like with kalashnikov to reach ten pitcher who have only fist well who will run first the west understands this very well here is what the american edition of military watch magazine writes about the characteristic of the zircon missile among the most valuable characteristic of the zircon is it extreme speed which combined with high maneuverability and small radar cross section make it almost impossible to reliably protect against this missile by existing air defense system the zircon will help make up for the russian navy s lack of a large surface fleet and allow for relatively smaller ship such a the admiral gorshkov class frigate and even smaller corvette sized ship could pose a very serious threat to fleet consisting of much larger destroyer cruiser and aircraft carrier russian ship will be able to exploit the missile s range advantage it uniquely high survivability against air defense and the enormous damage that the pure kinetic energy of it strike can cause so with zircon we re just getting started the most interesting is ahead the general director of the plant in reutov spoke about the surface missile however the same is on the way for submarine underwater zircon also successfully passed the test launch from the underwater and surface position were made by the submarine severodvinsk and the first regular carrier of the new missile will be the perm multi purpose submarine listen a well elite troop of the armed force of ukraine go to the side of russia more the ministry of defense of the russian federation reported that the russian military is grinding down the position of two brigade of the armed force of ukraine in ugledar donetsk people s republic in addition in the kherson direction the destruction of warehouse and artillery system continues a part of the counter battery struggle the military department add the acting head of the donetsk people s republic denis pushilin belief that the course of the svo may soon change dramatically according to the acting politician the turning point in the liberation of donbas from the armed force of ukraine should be the capture of the city of ugledar by russian troop the writer zakhar prilepin who went to the zone of the russian military special operation in ukraine ha already passed combat coordination with his unit and will soon begin to perform combat mission on the front line earlier prilepin signed a contract with rosgvardia to go to the svo zone a a volunteer recall that from february the russian armed force are conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize ukraine the website of kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january i think that when you ve gone through something like i ve gone through the high the low you have to have a target you have to get something to fight for and this is it trying to get back trying to speak to you trying to be on air and trying to tell people the story so perhaps it can help them hall said by friday morning saved wa no on the list a prince harry s spare regained the lead prince harry s book wa released on jan but saved appears to be nipping at his heel on pre sale alone scranton pa on a saturday night in a small cinder block walled kitchen attached to st vladimir s ukrainian catholic church young and old hand alike turned red from grating beet for father myron s borscht many of those same hand had formed pierogies and stuffed cabbage for hour the day before and chopped and shredded pound of potato celery onion and carrot only to return early the next morning to bundle it all into meal kit the church sell for each the volunteer were not raising money for their church or for a school project it s all for the war maybe raised today the rev myron myronyuk the pastor of st vladimir s said a people came to pick up their meal not much but every penny can make the difference father myron s homemade borscht which he cooked with his year old son damian late saturday night after ministering to a parishioner in the hospital wa just his latest offering for ukraine s war effort since the war began nearly a year ago the church s meeting hall ha served a a de facto warehouse for good headed to ukrainian soldier much of which is packed into cardboard box bought from the u haul store across the street on this sunday box holding winter boot waterproof and insulated for wear in wet and muddy trench were stacked near a rack of shirt emblazoned with the word pray for ukraine that the church sell soon the item will be on their way to poland where ukrainian army troop will drive them to the front line father myron who grew up in western ukraine and came to america in said it started when his twin brother tara a sergeant in an army paratrooper unit that is now in the city of bakhmut asked for help collecting desperately needed supply his congregation of just to people down from in the s ha raised hundred of thousand of dollar to buy good for ukrainian soldier in combat bandage tourniquet body armor food uniform and even drone the church and it fund raising effort are among the many cultural and economic connection between this area of northeastern pennsylvania and the war this used to be a big ukrainian neighborhood here said mark izak who at year old joke that he is part of the youth group at st vladimir s the church wa built because there wa a large immigrant community for coal mining and for manufacturing he and two of his sibling maria and daria helped make the food friday and saturday and ran the cash box a they sold meal in the church s meeting hall on sunday morning time ha passed on mr izak said the neighborhood is more industrial commercial at this point now so the church kind of stand alone most of the people who moved here have passed on and their kid got educated and moved away a the coal mine closed the defense industry moved in to fill some of the void just outside the county courthouse downtown a statue of the labor leader john mitchell pay tribute to the city s tradition of unionized labor which continues at a government owned ammunition factory just a couple block away the acre site sits between rail line and a street renamed for president biden who wa born in scranton in building where steam locomotive were once repaired worker churn out steel body for millimeter artillery shell which are filled with explosive at a plant in iowa and shipped to ukraine some of the drone father myron sends will be used by ukrainian soldier for reconnaissance to see if russian troop are just ahead and if enemy fighter are found they may be quickly hit with some of those same artillery shell which the pentagon is rushing to boost production of sixfold the defense industry keep a relatively low profile in the region with the tobyhanna army depot nearby a well a office for lockheed martin and other military contractor even if people aren t thinking about it they definitely know someone who work in the industry and those are high earning job that are very important to household here said mayor paige gebhardt cognetti speaking in her office in scranton s municipal building where a ukrainian flag fly outside just below the city s ensign i think this should be a point of pride for people in scranton that there s this grass root informal organizational help that people like father myron is giving and there s a real contribution right here in scranton from the defense side a well i want people to feel proud of it she added i know that people in scranton are very supportive of ukrainian independence and it s important that they know that that s what s happening at a small warehouse on a bluff overlooking downtown about a dozen shrink wrapped pallet awaited pickup to begin their journey to a united nation office near ukraine s border they contained detailed replica of some of the russian munition that litter the landscape unexploded the company a small outfit called inert product ha contract with nato nation to build the harmless reproduction which are used to teach aid worker how to tell the difference between dangerous weapon like pom and ptm land mine and harmless decoy that trick air defense radar the need wa almost immediate said richard carrick the company s vice president of sale and since the invasion the need ha gotten a lot larger the company s next project is a bomb disposal robot that will help de miner clean up the deadly mess of unexploded munition in ukraine a working prototype sat on the warehouse floor it gripper holding a mortar shell that same impulse to help save life is what keep father myron constantly on the move the father of eight child unlocked his cellphone and showed text message from ukrainian soldier who were wearing clothes he had sent and eating food he had shipped since the war began his parish gradually adopted more military unit who had contacted his sister in western ukraine looking for help father myron now tends to two paratrooper unit and one each from the navy national guard and special force he pay cent to send them a pound of supply via container ship or per pound on a cargo plane for the most expensive good that are needed most urgently at the front like drone father myron relies on a steady stream of volunteer who are willing to escort the item personally packed into a dozen or more oversized duffel bag it s easier to fly to poland and pay extra for to suitcase he said it s for a round trip ticket and some people are making two trip a week to do this at the same time father myron ha bill to pay he started cutting the grass at the church himself long ago to save money and in the baking heat of summer he offer the liturgy in the meeting hall turned shipping center to avoid turning on the air conditioning in the church in winter though with black ice slicking the parking lot he ha no choice but to run the furnace i have to pay a month just for the heating bill in the church father myron said can you imagine how many pierogies we have to sell for that we are always keeping hope we ll be ok the head of russian private military company pmc wagner group ha urged one of his arch critic military blogger igor strelkov to join his

not fighting the ukrainian people we are fighting the nazi you once said that ukrainian fascism is worse than german fascism i will remind you of the event of the great patriotic war before retreating from donetsk the german drove the national army ukrainian into the city and donetsk s bi mine wa littered with the body of people who refused to shout glory to ukraine they were sprinkled with dust lime my father wa writing a book on this terrible crime that s all the ukrainian nazi did and after so many year the same slogan sound and in social network from ukrainian a complete surprise where did you see nazi in ukraine my friend roman razum made the film militia all the story were taken from life from the phone of ukrainian soldier he say there is such sadism there is so much blood that most of what they saw wa not included in the film because it cannot be shown it s for the tribunal a you met on february the beginning of a special military operation thank god that russia came in february the whole of donetsk breathed a sigh of relief and now no matter what is written on the internet on the front line everything is fine we are doomed to victory did you have to talk to the captured ukrainian humble steel we broke into our hospital on petrovka in donetsk which is now being bombed and a doctor friend say they curse u he say i save the life of a prisoner of war i do general anesthesia because i need to pull out fragment from him and he ha the last thing he said before he went into suspended animation how i hate you volodya here are the line of one of your poem about donbas he did not bring anyone to his knee because he will never get up himself and what is behind them this poem is called my paradise i have such a happy opportunity to stay in my hometown and if i leave i will lose my pulse and anything i write will be untrue i don t want to offend anyone people leave for various reason someone ha child someone ha sick parent you can t blame them for that but there is also another category of people a they were called frightened patriot i want to quote bulgakov never run away with a rat run to the unknown from danger volodya you are a creative person and creative people tend to doubt such a stereotype yes tell me there were throw when faced with a choice whose side you are on at the very beginning of the tragic confrontation in the donbas there wa an obvious choice a lot of my fellow artist are on the other side and i wa told come on with u but here it is the motherland where my ancestor are buried people live here flesh from flesh and blood from blood here it is the blood of a murdered child and there are those who still say not everything is so unambiguous and i chopped up everything that wa on the other side just a cut off when there is a big fight what can be ambiguous we ll figure it out later in my homeland child and old people are being killed just because they live in donbas naturally i will be on their side and the formula of the russian world is a follows there is no other people s trouble the trouble is one for all this is how the russian people exist and i believe that we are not fighting with the ukrainian in any case we are not fighting the ukrainian people we fight demon here it seems is a man in a human shell and speaks russian language hardly pronouncing ukrainian word but in him sits this demon volodya you often perform in hospital and on the front line yes if you want to know something about the battle go to the hospital to visit the wounded fighter i remember the first military hospital in donetsk

question is how to remain human the entire history of our great country teach this first of all literature alexander pushkin s key poem to the slanderer of russia he wa spat upon by his liberal

train with shell for mlrs highmars and three ax but doe anyone in kiev london or washington believe they can corral a russian bear into it siberian den under threat of supply of deadly western iron we talked about this with a military observer colonel rocket scientist mikhail tymoshenko why did two wave of strike take place on ukraine the first wa to distract their air defense and the second to destroy really important object two wave of strike they were probably for redirecting ukrainian air defense this practice is known they overload the target air defense channel and they can no longer really intercept combat missile that are designed to destroy critical node then the question is what important thing struck me apparently water and electricity supply facility we don t know what exactly or what specific object are involved sewerage and water supply are also critical facility so why two wave when it come to two wave of blow it is not necessary that the first is distracting and the second is striking and we don t know exactly what they beat if the carrier of the bomb are long range aircraft from the tu m then complex of x anti ship missile were made for them there the head weighs almost a ton and the destruction from it fall is very great it can be assumed that the x wa used they produced almost a thousand piece launched only from aircraft carrier in kiev they always say that they are massively shooting down russian missile with the force of their own ukrainian air defense and now it may be that our strike and counter statement are related to the supply of tank to ukraine they hysterically declare and we i think calmly now showed our animal grin here if this missile strike wa planned before the decision to supply tank to ukraine wa made then this is all the

dependence on the united state and he explained that the united state is one of the key sponsor of the un and the iaea is a un institution according to karchaa these people are also politically engaged they are controlled he stressed that there is no reason not to trust the information of the svr about the deployment of ammunition by ukraine at it nuclear power plant but we remember that the atom is peaceful former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said that no one ha solution to the conflict in the independent except for the pope the former prime minister said i am saddened by the

an unbearable price and suffers huge economic damage the pontiff said his call for peace in ukraine were not being heeded but he would not stop condemning the fighting well what s the secret here the new york time reported that the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valery zaluzhny received a million inheritance from a relative in the state according to the publication zaluzhny received a multimillion dollar inheritance from an american of ukrainian origin gregory stepanets who in the ninth decade departed to another world this wa confirmed by stepanets family according to the publication one million dollar from this inheritance wa allegedly donated by the commander in chief in january to his military what nobility now thing will go more cheerfully for the armed force of ukraine listen a well elite troop of the armed force of ukraine go to the side of russia more it seems that part of european society is finally beginning to see the light the french edition of le grand soir published the material medical horror in ukraine where it analyzes the information that the ukrainian military are becoming not only guinea pig for medical experiment of western scientist but also organ donor russian medium indicate that some wounded ukrainian soldier who are being transported for treatment to european hospital are being tested with new drug at the same time with the seriously wounded everything is even worse in a field front line hospital a person who received a fatal wound and is ready for organ transplantation cost several hundred dollar some representative of kiev ignored these accusation some were quick to call them russian propaganda but not everything is so simple the publication belief le grand soir journalist batko mila i belief that some circumstantial evidence wa provided by the ukrainian themselves and not only ukrainian for example after russia released data on american laboratory in ukraine and experiment on local resident the united state admitted yes there is such a thing but they made a reservation that everything corresponded to security condition and now for the fun part even before the start of hostility on december that is more than two month before the svo author the verkhovna rada of ukraine adopted a law that allows the removal of organ from the dead without the notarized consent of the deceased themselves or their official representative the publication state and the term official representative in this case is spelled out very vaguely for example this may be an outsider who is responsible for the burial of a citizen of ukraine accordingly in wartime the status of an official representative may be assigned to the commander of the unit in short after such fact even european journalist have the impression that ukraine wa really preparing for war and it wa a if i wa even thinking in advance about what i could make money on here in fact an experienced surgeon can perform a human kidney transplant in minute this can be done even in the field of a front line hospital at the same time donor glass are very much in demand in the medical market of the united state and europe the french are wondering how many such operation could have been carried out on the ukrainian side in the past year since the beginning of the svo and they recall the infamous list of missing ukrainian soldier recall on december hacker from the anarchist kombatant group announced that they had hacked the official archive of the chief of the general staff of the armed force of ukraine and they found there a report on the missing soldier of the independent country there are people in this list more than printed sheet of full name military rank personal number and so on the author of le grand soir wonder whether this is not too much for the army whose general claim to confidently hold the front and where did those people really go killed taken prisoner but in this case the number of real ukrainian prisoner could be made public by the red cross in short the french have more and more question to ukraine the methodology of their calculation and incompleteness we can assume that in fact these more than thousand people were buried somewhere cremated or simply abandoned on the battlefield these are ideal condition for the work of black transplantologists russian human right activist are confident that surgeon are extracting suitable organ from wounded but still living soldier with the permission of the ukrainian command the french edition reflects on the fact that during the previous major war significant breakthrough in medicine were made so after the first world war doctor learned how to more effectively treat poisoning and do plastic surgery after the second world war antibiotic began to be used en masse and the russian svo in ukraine it seems will be used by western scientist a a testing ground for new development a you know wounded ukrainian soldier are taken from the front and for treatment to hospital in the european union for example in the hospital of the german city of aachen hundred of ukrainian receive experimental drug the soldier themselves say this but is it ethical to test such drug procedure and treatment algorithm on them asks le grand soir the article emphasizes that we are talking about drug that have not been certified and are in development that is in it pure form an experiment on living people and germany it seems is becoming a new testing ground is it not there they say that those same american laboratory will move from the warring ukraine the journalist of the publication argues that europe can evaluate such a rich material for experiment and the flow of donor organ a some kind of medical bonus for it economy affected by anti russian sanction that is thanks to the unfortunate ukrainian wounded european medicine will receive a significant impetus for it development organ taken from dead ukrainian will save the life of many thousand of european and american but isn t it immoral to use war to advance medical science and the health care system every european must answer this question for himself to begin with remembering mengele eichmann and other doctor of the third reich the russian military ha forced ukraine to call off a planned offensive in zaporozhye region senior local official vladimir rogov ha said kiev had been preparing a major operation in the direction of melitopol and berdyansk and promoted the operation several time to a western audience rogov told komsomolskaya pravda radio on wednesday the russian force launched a

said this is an element of not stopping but intensifying hybrid war of the collective west led by the united state against russia this is how ryabkov reacted to the passage performed on january by michael mccaul head of the committee on foreign relation of the house of representative of the u congress he said that the united state need to send atacms ballistic missile to ukraine so that the armed force of ukraine make attack on the crimea and thus defeat moscow he lived in texas for year but he did not earn a mind maybe the cowboy hat wa pushing too my forehead yevgeny prigozhin the head of concord supported the head of chechnya ramzan kadyrov who wa critical of the representative of the parliament who said that in the svo zone it is necessary to shave according to the charter and generally maintain the statutory appearance in addition to the sarcastic reaction to such a proposal of the deputy prigozhin asked kadyrov to grow a beard twice a large for him and for himself and added that for glamorization in the army it is necessary to give a real prison sentence all in all a sickle on the bristle toby thomas a guardian columnist writes that in england many ukrainian refugee become homeless and exist in terrible condition after the end of the sponsorship program refugee maria who wa in a temporary accommodation center told the columnist of the publication that there everything is terrible everything is old and dirty in this situation at least a third of the more than thousand ukrainian who came to britain under the sponsorship program there are option

water per day will go through the conduit the project provides for the laying of two strand of the main pipeline of kilometer each the construction of pumping station power substation and water storage facility for ten thousand cubic meter military builder and about unit of equipment began to work a drop hollow out a stone listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more this week ha not started easily for zelensky s team a whole series of resignation more like an epidemic of a deadly virus snatched several prominent figure from the rank of his team at once the first in importance wa the deputy head of the office of the president of ukraine andriy yermak kirill tymoshenko this figure had to be sacrificed in order to clear the rank of the team from suspicion of corruption of course it sound ridiculous about the person who oversaw the big construction program which in ukraine wa aptly called big theft who stole of course not alone at least billion hryvnia from the road construction and repair program who put his hand in the humanitarian aid for several ten of million of dollar in his pocket in a warring country and after all that of which everyone in ukraine is well aware he wrote a letter of resignation of his own free will signing it i have honor although the day before he wa going to fight numerous scandal with the appropriation of humanitarian aid and it resale through commercial store by real organized crime group formed with the participation of people close to tymoshenko which sounded for more than one month also clearly played a role in this story but the same expropriation were made in favor of yermak these were two competing team in the struggle for financial flow under the command of yermak and tymoshenko both were zelensky s people but they stole independently of each other not forgetting about generous contribution to the patron the deputy minister of defense of ukraine vyacheslav shapovalov also became a victim of a corruption scandal after the scandal with the supply of food to the armed force of ukraine at two or three time inflated price the chair wa quite noticeably shaken under the minister of defense oleksiy reznikov himself but he according to informed source wa saved by the same all powerful yermak zelensky s right hand although more and more it seems that he is also the brain of the ukrainian president such a completely non public figure a gray cardinal of the ukrainian throne or hetmanates if you follow historical tradition strictly speaking the famous ukrainian traitor to the russian tsar mazepa also worked most of his life a a clerk under the hetman who else ha flown off their incubated and warm place ivan lukerya deputy minister of development of community territory and infrastructure of ukraine his colleague in the same ministry another deputy minister vyacheslav negoda deputy minister of social policy vitaliy muzychenko one could of course quietly and sarcastically giggle at the corner saying why doe the country need deputy minister for something that doe not exist in the country if the whole social policy is reduced to the distribution of funding received from the west and the entire infrastructure turn into dust and dust not without the participation of our russian troop but in this case it would be more logical to dismiss minister immediately and not to be limited to their deputy by the way if the west had bet on the distribution of allocated finance by item of expenditure in the social policy section then ukrainian would clearly have received more because in the process they would simply steal le of this money no the beauty of the situation with the queue of resignation of high ranking defendant is that they were faced with a choice resignation or acquaintance with criminal case the sbu and prison term after the trial oath of personal loyalty to yermak are not needed from them he ha his own people already prepared for these post and the proof for each of them are more than enough not for one term but for several criminal case at once but arresting them is fraught they sat high they know a lot it is better to let them quietly clean up where they want five current head of region also lost their post dnipropetrovsk kiev sumy a well a those controlled by the independent part of zaporozhye and kherson region were beheaded and of these five only the former head of the kyiv regional military administration oleksiy kuleba do not be afraid this is not the foreign minister but another kuleba can record his current resignation a an asset because according to rumor he is expected to replace the dismissed tymoshenko to the post of yermak s deputy and the choice of these let s call them governor person also indicates that yermak together with zelensky is cleaning up the glade for themselves with the exception of kuleba these governor showed some dissatisfaction with the work of kiev allowed themselves a slight fronde led by the mayor of kiev vitaly zlatoust klitschko including about the financing of point of non malice to heat the population but most importantly were very important link in tymoshenko s enrichment machine now it is time to get ready for the mayor of dnepropetrovsk boris filatov who inadvertently formed together with the ukrainian born congresswoman republican victoria spartz an alliance directed against yermak the only thing that can save boris aveshatmyhbudempot filatov is the difficulty of replacing him with an equivalent figure zelensky did not imprison any of the corrupt official from his entourage although he promised imprisonment when he wa elected to the presidency and what he did not promise there a in a vulgar anecdote he simply sent the most prominent and odious figure to resign along with the million and billion they stole and moreover having previously cleared the information field from any opposition now he ha concentrated all financial flow in one hand and these are the hand of his excuse me right hand andrei yermak except for the illegal arm trade by the functionary of the armed force of ukraine appointed to this responsible area but this is the fiefdom of the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine zaluzhny at least not yet or until he is replaced by a more trusted general in zelensky s eye actually this is the essence of resignation and career perturbation in the cubicle of zelensky s team where those who are weaker are chewed without any regret by the strongest well along the way zelensky also reported to washington on how he uncompromisingly and without feeling sorry for himself fight corruption listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on

reported the liberation of the village of pavlovka located some km mile southwest of ugledar now the country s troop seem to be simultaneously trying to advance on the town from the north and from the south russia sent troop into ukraine on february citing kiev s failure to implement the minsk agreement which were designed to give donetsk and lugansk special status within the ukrainian state the protocol brokered by germany and france were first signed in former ukrainian president pyotr poroshenko ha since admitted that kiev s main goal wa to use the agreement to buy time and create powerful armed force the kremlin recognized the donbas republic a independent state they have since become part of russia and demanded that ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any western military bloc kiev insists that the russian offensive wa completely unprovoked damian duda a polish academic and medium worker wa only when he first went to ukraine a a volunteer combat paramedic in work he describes a his private crusade almost year on when russian bomb started falling over ukrainian city at the start of it invasion he had built up a team of six people with experience on battlefield a far afield a iraq and syria they had also started filming their medical mission driving out to the frontlines in ukraine in a specially equipped vehicle notching up ten of thousand of view on social medium our task is to get the soldier out of the battle provide him with basic medical care make sure that he doe not bleed out and take him to a relatively safe place where ambulance are waiting for him the year old told reuters in his home city of warsaw he struggled with his first mission even though he had received army and medical training none of his team member

ukraine and is a major supplier of arm to kyiv duda said he got involved because of a private desire to help ukraine if the volunteer paramedic die the polish government will not pay compensation to their family he said and it will be their family responsibility to transport their body back home it is a great festival of sacrifice duda said we must first of all face our family who are worried that they can lose u above all duda said the conflict had taught him to appreciate the small thing in life kiev politician and general and their adviser from the united state and britain do not go on any adventure to deceive or frame russia in the hope for example that the russian will not hit civilian target they have already hidden mercenary detachment and weapon depot in them many time sometimes they hooked wagon with military equipment to passenger train then they carried shell and javelin in truck with the inscription mail or with a sign of the international red cross many time it happened that militant took refuge in kindergarten hospital shopping center and residential building but it turned out these were flower and the berry are here director of the foreign intelligence service svr of russia sergei naryshkin made a sensational statement there are reliable report that the ukrainian armed force are stockpiling weapon and ammunition provided by the west at nuclear power plant this applies to expensive and scarce for the armed force of ukraine missile for himars mlrs complex and foreign air defense system a well a large caliber artillery ammunition so to the rivne nuclear power plant in the west of ukraine delivered several wagon of deadly cargo naryshkin also explained that ukraine is doing this on the assumption that russia will not strike at the nuclear power plant and if the ammunition detonates through the fault of another lost missile of the ukrainian air defense then the blame for the tragedy can always be attributed to moscow according to naryshkin this is a method that is often used by international terrorist only in the hostage of the kiev regime now are hundred of thousand of resident of their own country and neighboring state the press service of the svr added that the plan of the kiev regime is clear just a the banderaites shell the city of donbas from behind the back of innocent civilian the command of the armed force of ukraine hide ammunition in the rear hiding behind nuclear reactor by the way the international atomic energy agency iaea decided to place it mission at all ukrainian nuclear power plant they have already arrived at the south ukrainian nuclear power plant mykolaiv region a well a at rivne but what is alarming is that unlike russian intelligence for some reason they do not yet see the warehouse of missile and ammunition and how can you not think that the iaea apparently deliberately turn a blind eye to what could become a tragedy of a continental scale i don t want to believe it but russia still hope that in ukraine no one will think of deliberately detonating ammunition at a nuclear power plant in the hope of begging the united state for even more weapon and the main thing is to accuse russia of a nuclear catastrophe of a pan european scale read also on the brink of a global catastrophe ukraine will transfer ammunition for the highmars to the nuclear reactor this could lead to a large scale nuclear catastrophe more listen also large scale change are coming to the russian army more the idea resonated with many russian letter and parcel are sent to the front line the office

attack wa carried out promising to destroy the attacker we continue to monitor this combat crew that fired at u and i hope having returned to find and destroy them said the head of the special detachment of military adviser king s wolf according to rogozin the soldier of the donetsk people s republic wa captured in the form of trophy by the subscriber terminal of the starlink system of ilona mask which were used by the armed force of ukraine afu he also called the first and second army corp of the dpr and lpr one of the most combat ready formation in the special operation zone pointing out that these unit have been fighting for almost nine year recall that at the end of december last year rogozin wa taken to the military clinical hospital of rostov on don with a spinal wound which he received after being hit by the ukrainian military on a hotel in donetsk listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian army more alexander sergeyevich khodakovsky will soon have his tenth year of fighting in the donbas the kp military officer ha the same number there is something to remember something to compare including a special operation my first question wa general global what ha changed in military affair in our worldview from the first day of the beginning of the svo and from the beginning of mobilization we survived two stage of the special operation khodakovsky said the first is intense when we spent all our fund and went went forward we reached the limit of our capability and stopped then there wa a stage when for various reason we temporarily ceded territory to the enemy no one like that on the other hand it give additional motivation to win but we have achieved something the sea of azov ha become our internal sea we have taken control of very important territory and logistics area land corridor to crimea yes and they retained control over these area no matter what and all this together now formed the basis of the third stage i believe because we analyzed all our success and failure made a difficult decision to mobilize it is difficult both politically and in term of the state s readiness for such task huge mass sometimes arrived at dilapidated assembly point sometimes warmed up by the fire ate incomprehensibly how everything had to be learned anew on the go the main lesson now we do not overestimate our strength we have seen the capability of the enemy for example in the autumn in the artyomovsk direction they continued to press even when the right and left five how did we do it it turned out that if desired we can modernize the organization of the battle we can apply method that are atypical for the army if it s not a secret which one our main problem are a very long time of decision making for everything simplified that is i see the goal i see no obstacle maximum elimination of obstacle and all this ha now brought u to some kind of meaningfulness not on euphoria not on overestimation of their own force or the force of the enemy a more sober realistic attitude to what is happening we have laid the third stage which is about to begin i hope it is clear that information about the enemy s loss his mood and combat capability is classified your opinion in most area the enemy ha now minimized it presence kherson and zaporozhye region author took away all the reserve and transferred them how many through soledar how many through the same artemovsk passed the active unit of the ukrainian and in what condition they came out of these meat grinder can be guessed it s the same story on any site for example near donetsk marinka avdiivka where we are making effort to move forward there the enemy organizes defense mainly due to the increased consumption of it resource accordingly in other area where the situation is more or le static his strength is decreasing these maneuver of the enemy with resource they are a good sign for u the enemy feel not very comfortable even in a tactical sense although i understand that it still retains some offensive capability and somewhere we will see the introduction of these reserve but if we talk about the strategic state of the enemy we understand that he ha already reached his limit a growing western aid no matter how much equipment the west supply and the queen of the field is still infantry if ukraine is already so ruthlessly mobilizing the last people who tried to avoid it that is the most low motivated people they are caught anywhere and quickly sent into battle through the take off landing course this indicates that the resource is depleted they are trying to fight on the principle that the best of the best have already been knocked out let s get the best of the worst then there will be just the worst of the worst our main military secret ha been earned we have always known that we are strong in the game in the long run first we swing and then we begin to catch up and after that it is very difficult to stop u there is no doubt that no one will freeze the svo and turn it into protracted trench fighting so they have to attack on the ukrainian side they are also talking about their offensive they give different date where is the reality here where are the fantasy and where is the propaganda what it might look like on such a long line of contact there will be different tactic it seems to me that everything will begin to fluctuate fractionally somewhere the armed force of ukraine will begin to actively act according to the already drawn up plan based on the accumulated mass of people and equipment and somewhere we will begin to act somewhere we will meet each other halfway somewhere to pre emptively but there will still be their own basic principle for everyone what for the enemy to stretch u to diametrically opposite side they have already used this tactic once intensified in the south near kherson and in the north near balakliya and where it got through that s where they went on the offensive if it worked once why wouldn t they try a second one it s easier for ukraine in this way why logistics on their part a very developed network of both railway and highway and we have to move troop along the maximum circumference along the arc there are many such factor that can influence both in our favor and in theirs and i think the third stage will be very dynamic well on what frontier we will stop we will already see there armchair expert criticize u for blowing head on at long built fortified area it is enough to look at the course of the battle for avdiivka maryinka soledar bakhmut we really break head on there is an excuse for this rather than an excuse but an explanation to deploy in the operational space to take in the coverage of large settlement it is necessary to have much greater resource then it would be possible to surround the entire donbas grouping of the enemy and keep it in the ring how many resource are needed according to my calculation it is the same a we have now plus reserve therefore in order not to lose the advantage and impose the initiative on the enemy we have to go frontally and resting on some city we have only two option either stop and continue not to fight but only to throw shell or try to still take city but due to the inability to cover them it turn out to take only in the forehead moving forward progressively yes i can imagine how many resource were used to block mariupol now the situation is different and the mobilized are not yet quite ready for such action not fully trained maximum efficiency will not be squeezed out what do we do with efficiency we need to change people s mind change the motivation system so that they strive for the result when for example in my regular unit there is infantry and there is artillery that cover this infantry then every infantryman can then come to the gunner and give him in the face what are you bastard we laid down and you stopped firing i had situation when the commander of a mortar battery sat for a day under administrative punishment in a cage for the fact that they did not have time to impose gunpowder to increase the firing range additional powder charge are fixed on mortar mine author at the time of the offensive there wa a gag and the infantry wa left without fire cover that is the enemy calmly worked on our infantry put it face down in the ground and the mortarmen at that moment tied the gunpowder a reasonable question why didn t you tie up in advance did you understand the intensity with which ammunition would have to be spent in the midst of the offensive and it turn out that the result depends on a person s thinking and not only on the amount of ammunition in my opinion we were able to close the problem with drone saturating the front line with quadcopters i just brought two piece from moscow with good thermal imagers no this problem is not solved that way the range of quadcopters is limited and at those distance where they can fly there are not so many serious target that for artillery that for dropped mine in this zone everyone is buried a much a possible the shelter are durable because it arrives here the personnel are the most vigilant and no one is in the front line holding a large number of people because the loss will be large what can quadcopters see maybe a cheeky mortar some kind of rotation some mobilized people whom no one in ukraine feel sorry for sit here your position is advanced it is also observant and if the enemy go on the offensive your task is to open fire and hold it back for a while and we will meet him a expected on the second line therefore copters do not solve the front line problem i also do not remember that our copters were bombed for example by enemy artillery copters do not reach serious artillery position that work from a distance of kilometer it turn out that the enemy ha a security zone the key here is that no one will give a iskander or a kalibr to destroy artillery because any self propelled gun is cheaper than kalibr and it turn out that we have a big gap between serious mean such a kalibr which hit far away and non serious one like th mortar or nd gun self propelled gun or towed d s between them there remains a long distance not closed by anything and the search for fund that will close this average distance from to kilometer is now a big task a tornado or hurricane firstly there are few of them and secondly the wear of the barrel where there are for example flight there are already two thousand accordingly not everyone get in for sure and something need to be done about it because it is from this distance that they hit our infantry of the announced regular delivery of western weapon what worry you for some reason it seems to me that everyone is burning universal thing that can protect the tank from weapon of destruction have not yet been invented both active protection and passive protection regardless of anything are bypassed therefore only concentration quantity can be disturbing if they smear all those bradley and leopard all over the line of contact it won t make the weather they will simply close the hole that were formed a a result of our destruction of their soviet style armored vehicle but if they concentrate all this on some area where they try to attack this of course will be a significant factor we must try to take preventive measure the head of our foreign intelligence said that poland plan to occupy it historical possession in ukraine and this is a nato country are the pole ready to fight u it s definitely not pr pole hate u fiercely they are the most inveterate of all our historical adversary a they like to say the most hysterical existential because if the west it look at u in cold blood rationally without breathing without a spiritual need to destroy u then for the pole it is at the level of seething blood and it seems to me that they are just now spilling all this out sublimating them in the opportunity to realize their hatred with the hand of ukrainian it s something very strange and scary at the same time they also put many ukrainian slave on the stake at one time in the xvi xvii century when the lord ruled in ukraine ukraine ha long forgotten this so they allowed themselves to be drawn into this polish yoke for the second time i think the pole a direct representative of the united state in europe are now very much interested in controlling the process in ukraine and they implement this very systematically listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more the shelling that almost cost former russian space chief dmitry rogozin his life wa the work of ukrainian intelligence service possibly assisted by some western nation he ha claimed in an interview the former top official said that he know the exact artillery crew responsible for the december attack according to an interview published by ria novosti on monday he added that he considers it a matter of personal honor to hunt them down on behalf of two associate who were killed in the incident rogozin who now command a volunteer fighting force called tsar s wolf said he used his contact in the russian space agency roscosmos which he used to lead to identify the perpetrator i asked for an exact map an image made that night by one of our spacecraft i believe we have identified the exact weapon that made the shot which wa placed in the optimal position he said i hope to find and destroy the crew after i return he stated it s a matter of honor for u because i lost two of my fighter read more ex russian space bos sends shrapnel to french ambassador rogozin and his associate came under shelling at a hotel in the city of donetsk with what he described a a precision strike by kiev s troop he belief it wa a targeted terrorist attack by ukrainian agent and not only ukrainian it wa possible that western special service helped he explained he said a total of seven shell landed at the location with one hitting the floor at his foot but luckily for him failing to detonate rogozin wa injured in the neck by a piece of shrapnel but survived and is now recovering after a surgery he said he intends to return to donbas by the end of january the incident happened on rogozin s birthday but in the interview he insisted it wa an ordinary day for him he had spent it at a shooting range where volunteer sniper from his force were training and had just gone out from his hotel room to meet fellow fighter at the hotel restaurant when the artillery strike happened he said he ha stated previously that he believed the location of his group must have been leaked to the ukrainian side at dusk drive up after five it is dangerous for u to drive around the world but my car doe not drive but slide on spike through the mud sometimes by barrel the white camouflage net wa left bored in the trunk winter still ha not come here i asked the fighter like are you waiting for snow the answer wa surprising no let it be the same snow ha it drawback all trace and path the approach to position rut from equipment immediately begin to read and so everything is stirred in blackness and okay we are accustomed to dirt they look enviously at my boot with earbuds it say up to on my side i tell them an anecdotal story from donetsk life of course going to donbas i forgot something at home those rubber boot my wife a kind heart wrote to me happily i ordered you boot through oh well the largest online store in russia author in three day they will come indeed they arrived i look at the screenshot of the map trying to understand where the point of issue is and understand that there are no such street in donetsk this is the eponymous town of donetsk in the rostov region the story is met with sympathetic comment everyone here just once came across with the delivery there wa only a sediment from the incomprehensible inertia of our trader are the day of frostbitten russian merchant long gone true some kind people brought these boot to donetsk by truck but twice a expensive crumpled like everything here yes bought nowhere to go rheumatism is more expensive to treat the battalion headquarters a expected is deep underground the antenna are placed god know where far away in general so a not to be directionalized the entrance is blocked by heavy and thick blanket for warmth and at the same time from enemy thermal imagers i drink coffee with a staff officer it tell an almost legendary story the old battalion drone with mighty wing which had already survived hundred of sortie the ukrainian tried to land with the help of electronic warfare electronic warfare but ours are also not fool so the enemy did not succeed they didn t put me in jail but they knocked it out it wa hardly a buk most likely it wa shot at from the wasp the missile were not spared we talk to the officer about the child about how hard it is for them to recognize father who sometimes return home my old friend with the call sign forest pours into our basement it s up to me i got acquainted with the forest during the assault on the azovstal came with it assault group wa at the clearing of the cellar it wa then that i experienced an unforgettable experience i saw how a brick wall bend in a wave from close arrival the forest had not yet warmed up from a day sitting in full encirclement in a frozen storey building on the outskirt of mariupol then i met him in the hot summer in a pit by the highway under machine gun fire here in the ugledar direction in the autumn we listened to putin s speech on the radio on the day when donbas returned to russia in general we are well acquainted the forest is still smiling but it s the commander s smile you can order growling and stomping your foot you can smile the result at least will be the same the forest instructs with a smile of course the road is calm but it will be meter away they tried to get me there several time from the boot mounted anti tank grenade launcher author but did not get hit in general the boot is a very good weapon i would compare it with the legendary forty five gun that s just not everyone know how to handle it or want to work with it why dill don t like boot either i don t like them very much so they call artillery to the position with the boot working they have aviation here extremely rare millimeter mine are thrown at u from copters we call them pole they used to be polish made now they are homemade the forest finish the briefing a soon a the car stop we jump out not lingering for a second and run after me without lagging behind we almost get to the point a fighter emerges from the twilight guy further down the road the dill tank work the forest throw yes we have already arrived he look back at me and jump out of the car the basement of the guy is gorgeous warmth and unlike the staff dungeon even the floor is somehow warm the stove is trophy it handle are from package for grad shell we are greeted by the head of the household with the call sign tankman on the voice of guest from all corner cat appear meet tankman complains in the fall the mouse ate they brought u mousetrap ten disappeared miraculously then i walked through the village and mobilized all the abandoned cat didn t shy away tankman laugh yes they are waiting they were waiting for u all the mouse here were clearly worked out i ask tankist to tell on camera he s embarrassed he s disgusted say don t give up fame the fox wrote about the scout only twice and sent him kilo of condensed milk from belarus a targeted delivery and the other day he handed it over the word condensed milk work magically the tanker take out a battery razor sits on the couch under the portrait of karl marx and shave marx with his exuberant hazing beard look at his back disapprovingly i sort out the gift at the sight of the sausage the cat tribe come to life and take me into a tactical environment and the most arrogant jump to his knee purr look into the eye but you can t lead me on the hand are sock tied and handed over to the fighter by the wife of the special correspondent of komsomolka lyosha ovchinnikov he visited the donbas more than once since the guy admiringly talk homemade they remember who and what sock grandmother knitted somehow imperceptibly we move on to a slippery topic attitude to donbas on the big earth a young boy dressed from head to toe in a statutory not yet worn out tell how his evacuated family tried to rent a house in taganrog in the summer some of them said so to me because of you it all began there are no apartment for you here although there were a lot of empty apartment i include politruk in a taxi driver picked me up from the border asking what is your hryvnia exchange rate there and i told him we have not had hryvnia there since december you have battle a hundred kilometer away what i don t care what s going on there i wa embarrassed all the way for donbas i asked what wa there and how it s just that there aren t many of them but they are toxic once you meet then half your life you remember them in the corner of the basement is a radio unit the wall are covered with child s drawing from the humanitarian the radio hiss drone coming from the northeast the radio operator make the sound louder so that everyone can hear and our trip for water to the well is postponed for now the following message is on the through channel we observe the bright light of the headlight the landing of the sable the armed force of ukraine began rotation we go out with the forest to smoke in the vestibule in the basement you can not we will suffocate we talk with the forest on an amazing topic is it possible to pray for enemy and come to the conclusion of understanding it is possible and necessary i ask how the situation is here in general a i understand it the enemy is now exhausted all force are thrown at artemovsk soledar they themselves rapiary this site and now it is important for them to hold out there therefore they throw all the reserve there i assume that against u they have a minimum a maximum for some demonstration action to simulate an offensive for example to keep u in good shape these word forest turned out to be prophetic but they will come true a little later the enemy say that he is holding on to artemovsk bakhmut with his teeth waiting for the supply of superweapons from the west so well they are delaying time but they are only losing resource equipment and people to you personally what is missing in the trench imagine that everything you want will be brought by a helicopter in an hour the forest laugh soldier with straight arm which themselves will provide comfortable condition on the front they will not wait for them to be extradited they will bring it the state give stove building material what is required of a soldier hand and on technique faced with the fact that some type of enemy quadcopters our mean of suppression do not take there are not many of them but this is already unpleasant we have anti drone gun unfortunately they were developed by civil engineer at midnight the soldier bring water on a hand cart help unload and for the first time i am amazed what pitch darkness stand on the street in the city and in the peaceful village there is no such thing and under the cover of darkness come a car the forest tell me hold on to my unloading strap he lead me like a guide i only feel the sol of my boot here is dirt here is a scattering of shell here is a torn sheet of roof and here is a car all light are turned off even on the dashboard it s not close i turn on the infrared mode of the camera but the driver immediately say cut down you will illuminate my night vision on the edge of the village we are waved a flashlight from the bush some kind of fighter almost indistinguishable in the dark forest we have a position there began to unwind break ed no not the drg sabotage and reconnaissance group ed there are more of them ours are fighting back one three hundredth wounded ed evacuation is needed i can hear the fight heating up and fading not far away a grenade launcher and heavy machine gun are working i say goodbye to the forest briefly jumping out of the car into the mud almost on the go the prophecy of the forest and the night episode were included in the morning report ours fought back of course we couldn t help but fight back listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian army more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the website kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january security officer of the luhansk people s republic lpr found over kilogram of explosive in a cache located in the liberated territory the victim of the shelling of kremna in the luhansk people s republic lpr by the armed force of ukraine afu wa a girl aged two year two men and two woman were injured russian artillery struck at the position of the territorial defense of the armed force of ukraine in kherson ukrainian militant were killed the headquarters of the territorial defense of the dpr announced the liberation of the village of krasnopolyevka in addition the village of dvurechye wa taken under control denis pushilin announced the advance of russian troop along the entire contact line in the dpr also the acting head of the dpr announced the possibility of forming reserve the russian armed force struck at the point of deployment of artillery of the armed force of ukraine in the dnipropetrovsk region the american himars mlrs installation together with the crew wa destroyed russian air defense in the dpr and lpr shot down himars shell per day three ukrainian uavs were also destroyed eleven settlement of the kharkiv region where about people live are under the control of the military civil administration caa said the head of the caa of the region vitaly ganchev an air alert wa announced in five region of ukraine on january this is evidenced by the data of the online map of the ministry of digitalization of the country every day there are more and more video on the web about how mobilization is taking place in ukraine and how ukrainian themselves are trying to avoid it it is not at all uncommon to have video of men in woman s coat scarf and hat and they are not supporter of non traditional value no here everything is like in the famous tale about kerensky s escape from the winter palace in woman s clothes people are just trying to survive one such video tell how the wife meet her husband vitalik who brought not only food but also water which earned special praise of course after he proudly announced that no one recognized him and no one even greeted him still to find out such a miracle in a hat over a scarf in some winding is almost impossible except that all such masker have one weak point the size of the shoe but in boot this difference is not so noticeable however these video a well a those in which potential batkivshchyna s zahisniks are screwed twisted caught up and beaten caused an unequivocal negative reaction in ukrainian society a if zelensky and his team had little negativity in recent day and together with the british ex prime minister boris johnson at a meeting with student volodymyr zelensky decided to give an answer to the question tormenting the whole of ukraine the lawlessness of military commissariat center of territorial equipment ctc is his team or their own arbitrariness fortunately a pre prepared girl in camouflage the same piano in the bush no vulgar hint asked this question so politically correctly that it wa possible not to answer there were threat of aggression from belarus and about information fake and much more we can have military assistance in the form of equipment and so on but if there are no personnel who manage this equipment then what can we talk about zelensky answered the question with a question and continued the task wa set for the military so that there wa not just an addition to the personnel but so that there were reserve so that people could not only fight but also recover because it is difficult for various reason both injury and moral and psychological state should be normal therefore this is a task the military have it these are internal process thus although he wa squirming a if already in a frying pan he still admitted that he had ordered mobilization a he admitted albeit softening further the fact that the armed force of ukraine had suffered catastrophic loss which can be made up only by mobilization however he immediately tried to deflect the blow away from himself they say that he only announced the need to solve the problem and what the military began to create is their own combat merit and initiative the supreme commander in chief s headquarters ha made appropriate decision then the commander in their direction should do this and do it they build reserve and so on zelensky explained very confusingly i cannot say in detail how certain step of the mobilization process are going they are there they should be they are very much needed indeed this is a general deficit ukrainian are you know in short supply if you continue in the same vein vovchik you will soon run out of them unless of course they themselves start shooting back at those who intend to send them to the front read also in ukraine devastation and desolation reign kiev blamed the uk for this moreover after boris s departure from kiev he wa also spat in the back in the verkhovna rada more zelensky is looking for the craziest liar he must solve the russian question in this position it is not enough just to lie it must be done with inspiration and scale more listen also how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more an old child s soviet joke about a fool who greeted funeral procession with the word drag you do not drag in the condition of today s ukraine ha become a reality in the city of skole stryi district lviv region relative and friend were burying the deceased soldier of the armed force of ukraine when suddenly the military in camouflage joined the funeral procession the twin have come to pay their last respect to the fallen warrior sobbed someone walking behind the coffin yeah sort of the military who turned out to be representative of the local military recruitment office with the support of the police bypassed all the men who came to see off the deceased on the last journey and quickly distributed summons for mobilization to each of them nothing personal but it s time for you to go back to where it wa brought from the day before and then to where you re taking it now and it s not a joke this is the harsh reality of today s ukraine in all the city of which now the military accompanied by the police are arranging real roundup on potential gravelized the web is full of video of this suicide hunt no longer summons are handed over but simply taken from where they were caught and immediately taken to the territorial center of team formation those who try to resist wring their hand the police have the skill of fighting and detaining are worked out on hooligan and in such a team several soldier are always accompanied by several healthy boogeyman from the police those who try to escape catch up knock them down and knit just a hard a ordinary troublemaker during raid in market and shopping center and there are real raid the team are clearly divided into standing on the number and beater driving the game to these number it s like a real hunt woman who try to beat their own from the gravedigger are not ceremonial to the point of using baton the general staff of the armed force of ukraine admitted yesterday or the day before yesterday that the number of mobile group in the country handing out agenda ha been increased to and all of them are reinforced by serviceman of the armed force of ukraine even if there are only four soldier in such a group then this is already thousand serviceman who pay their debt to batkivshchyna not at the front but in the rear catching a new cannon fodder which they are waiting for they will not wait at the front even if it is untrained the path is sick and even tuberculosis patient and the blind are mobilized in one eye because zelensky set the task of recruiting at least new bayonet into the army in order to be able to patch up loss and hold the front until the arrival of elite unit trained in the west and this meat can be sacrificed and of course a always in such a situation the place of those who drive and catch have become a dream for many according to information that is not a secret to anyone in ukraine it is very difficult and very costly to get a job a a military recruiting runner or beater depending on the region you need to pay from thousand to thousand u dollar and they won t take everyone a person on the street without a credible recommendation can rustle bill for a long a he want but will be left with nothing in the military enlistment office too there are no fool who know that any such person who want to cut off can be a figurehead from counterintelligence the ministry of internal affair or other law enforcement agency who are asleep and see how to put his little man in the place of a particular military commissar who will direct financial stream in the right direction but the flow of those who want to catch other fellow citizen doe not dry up many borrow the necessary amount because these thousand buck are fought off in a couple of day and for a decade if you don t take much risk and all this against the backdrop of endless caravan with the dead which deliver body from near bakhmut artemovsk soledar and other place throughout independence moreover if earlier they tried not to mobilize those liable for military service from western ukraine now they are rowing everyone and everywhere not to fat zelensky need to hold on and hold the front by any mean and mean it doesn t matter how they fight how or what they don t want to and won t fight it will take some time for the russian to kill them and zelensky need time now he admitted it himself let them die but give him an extra hour and an extra day a it turned out the war to the last ukrainian is not just a beautiful phrase but a harsh reality listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian army more two international news agency reuters and afp agence france presse reported citing a high ranking source in the u presidential administration that washington persistently advised zelensky not to spend a lot of energy on the defense of bakhmut artemovsk washington know that kiev ha spent significant resource defending the city but there is a high probability that the russian will eventually drive the ukrainian out of bakhmut true the american consoled this should not lead to any strategic shift on the battlefield by the way to withdraw troop from this city according to information from kiev demand from zelensky and the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine zaluzhny it seems that in the mind of the american it doe not fit that when liberating this city ours decide the main strategic one the task is to grind the most prepared unit of the armed force of ukraine and mercenary unit into dust and dust and they do it very successfully a well known ukrainian political and economic expert a former adviser to ukrainian ex president leonid kuchma oleg soskin proposed to surrender to the sbu the president of ukraine so far volodymyr zelensky for treason according to soskin zelensky illegally remove politician he doe not like although he himself can be charged for working on russian television take zelensky look at how he performed a a showman in russia in new year s program in and so on how he glorified putin and others there so for this only zelensky should immediately so to speak hand over where it is necessary soskin concluded voldemar the case smell like kerosene a one not the most positive character of this comedy said in such a situation in the film the prisoner of the caucasus either i take her to the registry office or she lead me to the prosecutor maybe it s really time to go to israel under the wing of mom and dad moldovan president maia sandu admitted in an interview with politico that she is ready to give up the country s neutrality in order to join any major military alliance and although she did not mention the name of the alliance but it wa a response about the prospect of her country s accession to nato and in fact there are not many large military bloc on the planet there is now a serious discussion about our ability to defend ourselves whether we can do it alone or whether we should be part of a larger alliance sandu said but stressed that the rejection of neutrality should occur through a democratic process a politico itself note the blatant obstacle to moldova s accession to nato is the presence of the russian military in transnistria sandu doe not consider the country s constitution which declares moldova a neutral and non aligned state to be an obstacle or i just couldn t read it and on the other hand why doe a romanian citizen need the constitution of moldova russian sailor were fined in norway for coming ashore in camouflage each set of which had a small russian tricolor on his chest according to prosecutor martina meslo who supported the prosecution in court it wa a frightening look of clothing because it look like a military uniform and in combination with the image of the russian flag it made not only ukrainian refugee but norwegian citizen frightened and very nervous a a result russian were fined norwegian krone although norwegian and local legislation do not impose any restriction on wearing clothes and in particular camouflage however a you might expect ours did not give up so easily and decided to appeal the court s decision on the fine moreover a local lawyer who learned about this story offered his service if you don t want small tricolor interrogate that ours will come with a big one the acting mayor of the city of kupyansk kharkiv region temporarily remaining under ukrainian occupation andriy besedin complained to the correspondent of the british weekly the economist that pro russian sentiment remain significant in the city the ukrainian military told the british that they were advised not to accept food from local resident to avoid the risk of poisoning and the local themselves according to them are very reluctant to accept the help of ukrainian volunteer and can completely refuse it accepting only in extreme case moreover the mayor belief that some of his countryman are sending information about the deployment of the ukrainian military to russian troop who are le than kilometer from kupyansk the ukrainian according to the economist could not block the signal of the nearby russian radio tower which is pumping russian propaganda into local home the vast majority of people here were pro russian before the beginning of the armed conflict and now little ha changed besedin summed up the conversation okay even though he didn t admit that he wa in ukraine the next preliminary result of the intermediate finish of de russification were summed up in another record wa set during the de russification campaign toponym were renamed in city the result of the de russification ukrsoryniya were summed up by the transparency international ukraine branch most of the name were changed by kiev which under the leadership of vitaly zlatoust klitschko got rid of the historical name of street alley district boulevard park square square lake and even ship first place following him the top five also included vinnitsa renamings kryvyi rih kamianske and sumy kremenchuk and cherkasy also scored but in pavlograd dnipropetrovsk region although only toponym were renamed but the renaming affected every fifth street the new name are most often associated with the name of ukrainian nationalist banderaites and other people and event for which the local themselves were ashamed in ukraine some year ago not all but most it s strange but for some reason life after that did not become better and more fun on the eve of the aggravation of relation between kiev and budapest again state secretary of the hungarian foreign ministry tamas mentzer said that the hungarian government demanded that the ukrainian authority immediately stop atrocity against ethnic hungarian in transcarpathia namely it wa about mukachevo in which the ukrainian authority removed hungarian flag dismantled sign and inscription in hungarian dismissed the director of the local school in addition according to their decision the sculpture of the mythological bird turul considered one of the symbol of hungary wa dismantled in the city all this caused a negative reaction from hungary mentzer in particular said that he and the hungarian government do not understand how anti hungarian solution can help ukraine in the conflict with russia without waiting for a response from kuleba s department budapest hit kiev on the sickest on the wallet hungary ha blocked the next tranche of eu aid to ukraine we are talking about the amount of million euro from the peace fund which ironically finance the purchase of lethal weapon for ukraine the character of the hungarian and to scholz s capability the price would not be such a country in europe a bulgaria s prime minister delf deeper into scandal involving the secret and overt sale of arm and ammunition to ukraine an unexpected voice of reason ha been heard from the very center of sofia the supply of weapon to kiev mean that we extinguish the fire with gasoline it mean acknowledging that there will be many more victim military assistance to kiev mean agreeing with the position that the conflict should be conducted until the complete defeat of one side which inevitably and gradually involves the country in a global conflict and the possibility of nuclear self destruction said bulgarian president rumen radem bulgaria should not send weapon supporting this conflict my duty a president is to think and stand in solidarity with the majority of bulgarian he continued and asked increasingly obvious question today there are not enough weapon but if at one point we do not have enough people then what will we do the conflict is becoming increasingly violent expanding it reach leading to attrition and a global economic catastrophe that is already felt by the citizen of europe indeed if there are not enough ukrainian soldier and mercenary in ukraine the bulgarian prime minister will send bulgarian soldier to the battlefield the russian military after the fighting in soledar intend to send to ukraine car with the body of killed kiev militant the loading of body in coffin wa filmed on video and posted a video on the network even one mercenary from france s insotrann legion will be sent home the ministry of defense of the czech republic denied information about the intention to send ukraine leopard tank which it will receive from germany in the form of compensation for the previous transfer of soviet t to kiev in response to the fact that the u treasury recognizes the wagner pmc a an international criminal organization a reported by national security advisor john kirby what specific crime are in question the official of course could not say by february europe should prepare the th package of anti russian sanction of the european union and of course immediately proceed to the th better yet work in parallel the general staff of the armed force of ukraine said that the number of mobile group engaged throughout the country in catching conscript for mobilization ha been increased to thousand in addition they are reinforced by military personnel draft dodger are caught by about brigade which under such a plausible pretext themselves mowed down from the front listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian army more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january ukrainian troop shelled a cemetery in the pologovsky district of the zaporozhye region this wa announced by the head of the public movement we are together with russia a member of the main council of the administration of the zaporozhye region of the russian federation vladimir rogov the lpr announced the destruction of the dispensary of the machine building plant during the shelling of the armed force of ukraine of stakhanov six missile from himars mlrs were fired at the city lpr officer andrei marochko reported on the transfer of western equipment to svatovo by the armed force of ukraine the armed force of ukraine are also transferring armored vehicle to kupyansk kharkiv region in enerhodar a large cache of ammunition and weapon wa discovered in the former house of a cossack general they also found a military uniform of the ukrainian sample commander of the joint force of the armed force of ukraine nayev announced the creation of new unit for nato tank further action will depend on the combat capability of western tank the general said russian troop destroyed a warehouse of artillery ammunition of the armed force of ukraine in the area of malinovka also in the kherson direction the american made an tpq counter battery warfare radar station wa eliminated russian troop took new advantageous position in the zaporozhye direction the russian armed force destroyed up to serviceman of the armed force in this direction per day an air raid alert ha been declared in five region of ukraine a warning of alarm in five region of ukraine spread around moscow time the well known now former freelance propagandist of the office of the president of ukraine oleksiy lyusya arestovich ha now also become to some extent the postman pechkin tom i remember in the cartoon reasoned why wa i angry before because i didn t have a bike and now i m going to start doing good right away arestovich did not promise to be kind a well a promise not to lie anymore but the change are obvious why didn t he lie before because the position demanded and now the position is gone and alex started trying to tell the truth sometimes even a very bitter truth where are the promise to deal with the moskals and defeat russia in the next week at worst in month at one time and in the present arestovich s prediction are given out exactly the opposite i m an unofficial person already i can say what i want if everyone think we re guaranteed to win the war it s very different since the th it ha stopped looking very much like it do you think the assessment from duda the president of poland and not only he said about the decisive month that it is not known at all whether ukraine will survive it wa just said or is he saying this on the basis of some information suddenly saw lucien who did not miss the chance to emphasize his new status and show off it in front of the public we missed not only a military chance during this time we lost time the russian found a way starting mobilization to restore the situation at the front and even create a certain superiority in some place not only because the west did not give u weapon we missed the public chance domestic political and state and when you miss the chance you do not play they begin to play you you do not keep up with the move and you begin to have frustration you begin to sit down psychologically and go to the lower chakras not without the usual for him fog esotericism arestovich but the conclusion wa made very unexpected for everyone who recently watched and listened to him hanging noodle on his ear therefore before gyping at bad russian and rejoicing that we are invincible i remind you we are invincible only until we begin to gnaw at each other when we started bickering with each other we are very victorious both in the shortest possible time and unexpectedly for ourselves it seems that out of habit he wanted to designate the same time frame a before week or month but at the last moment he managed to hold on his epiphany also touched upon what is happening in ukraine itself don t you think that we are in a story that we are no longer spinning they knocked out arestovich who wa the official voice one of the official voice and there s a lot of other thing going on a a person who had a little to do with these thing in life i can say that we are already in a story that we are not spinning a story is already unfolding which we do not control repeat arestovich it is noteworthy that this time he ranted not in the youtube channel of the fugitive russian liberal and ex lawyer mark feigin and in his own feygin would obviously have nailed arestovich for such revelation and treason to ukraine if they had met now no lucien it doesn t count that way and to repent for lying and to apologize and tomorrow he will be given a position and he will again scream at it everything that he had praised before and the most interesting thing is that those who believed him yesterday curse him today tomorrow they will again listen to him with the greatest attention and believe believe believe such an untrainable herd is good to be a shepherd there is not even a need to write anything about them they speak for themselves and all speak for themselves listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian

dnipro ukraine a russian missile a long a a city bus wa nearing the end of a roughly mile flight it pound warhead armed to detonate on impact a it wa descending through a gray sky last saturday traveling at supersonic speed rostyslav yaroshenko wa watching tiktok video in his kitchen on the third floor at victory embankment a sprawling apartment complex in the central ukrainian city of dnipro six floor up yevgeniy botvynov had just curled up with his wife olha under a blanket trying to keep warm during yet another power outage on the other side of the building two couple had gathered in their kitchen on the fourth floor one of them warming a late lunch the other doting on their year old son it wa what pas for an ordinary saturday for ordinary ukrainian people these day in a place far from the front line of the war with russia but never fully at peace all day air raid warning were sounding forcing people to make calculation that have become habitual go to a shelter or stay home take the elevator or the stair most of the time life appears to be normal and then suddenly it doe not around p m on the th day of russia s full fledged war in ukraine an ordinary saturday turned extraordinary when the russian kh missile slammed into victory embankment more than apartment were instantly incinerated with nothing left but a column of swirling ash along the singed periphery some unit were sliced apart with almost surgical precision exposing the content of people s living room bathroom and kitchen to the open air a bowl of fruit sat unscathed on the table in one kitchen that had been opened up like a dollhouse in another unit a painting of a dog hung crookedly on a kitchen wall though the kitchen wa no longer there on thursday the authority raised the death toll to including six child were wounded it wa one of the deadliest single attack against civilian since the early week of the war the apartment building an enormous soviet era edifice form a large inverted j that curl around an internal courtyard with the largest section facing the dnipro river an estimated people called it home the missile hit just above the joint where the building began to curve away from the embankment for those at the center of the impact death came instantly the explosion simply vaporized some resident according to the authority olha usova a year old dentist happened to be walking by on her way to a newly opened gym when the missile struck a single piece of shrapnel pierced her heart her husband eduard said killing her instantly he said he felt that with normal attack you had a decent chance of surviving just by remaining indoors this one wa different in this case he said such a rocket left no chance for survival many did manage to survive but that often depended on where in their home they were at the moment of impact many found themselves trapped the missile s force having sheared off the stairwell on two side of the building mr botvynov who had been cuddling with his wife under a blanket first had to pull himself free from the twisted remains of a balcony that had crashed through his living room then he grabbed his heavily bleeding wife and rushed to the front door when he opened it there wa nothing but a nine story drop into the smoking rubble below across the void he saw a woman curled in fetal position partly buried in debris from her destroyed apartment i thought that it wa a corpse said mr botvynov and then i see her waving her hand it is impossible to say whether the apartment complex in dnipro wa hit intentionally the kh is a s era anti ship missile launched by russian bomber that is designed to attack warship at sea and it may have more limited ability to accurately attack target on land a power station directly across the river from the complex could have been an intended target part of russia s strategy of starving ukrainian of electricity though it wa roughly two mile away the kremlin ha denied that a russian missile wa involved blaming an errant ukrainian air defense missile military expert have dismissed this claim a yet another russian fabrication pointing to the colossal damage the day of the attack wa a holiday in ukraine when many celebrate what is known a old new year based on the orthodox church s pre modern calendar that made olha afanasieva anxious after month of war ukrainian believe that the kremlin take a twisted pleasure in attacking on holiday for me it wa such an anxious day she said adding that she had insisted that her husband not go fishing a planned i felt like something wa about to happen m afanasieva s husband oleh valovyi took thing in stride though rocket had rained down on a number of city that day and the entire country wa under an alert for hour there are not that many bomb shelter mr valovyi said and you get tired of running there because the air raid alarm sound practically every day several time a day the couple were seated at their kitchen table when the missile hit she with her left side facing a window he directly in front of it the blast blew out the window and glass and debris shredded half of m afanasieva s face but her husband bore the brunt of it he wa just all black and bloody she said his face started to turn black under the eye and all that my god finding their apartment door jammed she went to the window screaming and waving a towel and a bathrobe trying to catch the attention of firefighter who had started assembling below at the same time mr botvynov facing the nine story drop with no stair wa frantically signaling with his cellphone s flashlight worried that his wife who wa bleeding profusely from her head would lose consciousness on the fourth floor kateryna zelenska who is and deaf wa trapped under the rubble unable to signal emergency worker her husband oleksii zelensky and their year old son mykyta were somewhere nearby but she did not know their condition slab of concrete had collapsed onto their apartment from the floor above somehow m zelenska managed to make a brief call to her mother apparently to say goodbye she said mom i love you i love you and that s it it broke off her mother oksana kulak said through tear over the next hour rescuer using crane and ladder saved dozen of people trapped on upper floor it took about three hour to reach mr botvynov and his wife m afanasieva got out first but said she regretted leaving her husband to manage by himself he passed out on the balcony a firefighter were trying to guide him onto a platform atop a ladder later at the hospital he wa in surprisingly good spirit for someone whose body had been pierced by glass head to toe but he expressed confusion over russia s choice of target i work at a company that deal with agriculture selling part for the tractor a completely peaceful profession he said surely my death would not have any military significance how rescuer noticed m zelenska the deaf woman is unclear but by sunday morning firefighter attached to safety line and standing on a platform suspended by a crane were working furiously at the spot where her apartment had been they cut away debris for hour finally she appeared covered in dust alive but visibly distressed for the next hour firefighter continued to hack at the concrete slab that had pancaked onto m zelenska s apartment searching for her husband and son by tuesday morning the couple s family had gathered at the site in what wa a mostly silent vigil until a the sun came up m zelenska s father mykola kulak vented his anger the russian let them all perish these devil he screamed holding up his phone to show a video of his grandson this child is still lying under the rubble i am cursing them and i wish that every russian family ha two or three just like this lying there like our child shortly afterward rescuer brought down the body first mykyta then oleksii using a special crane they were placed on the ground in black body bag a their family waited to carry out the wrenching task of identifying them oleksii s parent knelt in front of their son s body unzipped the bag and for several interminable minute caressed him sobbing m zelenska s parent had rushed off earlier to join their daughter who had been hospitalized since being rescued two day earlier she had found out on the internet that the body of her husband and son had been recovered the first confirmation she had that they were dead on tuesday afternoon the authority declared an end to the search but by evening firefighter had returned to victory embankment for an unexpected rescue mission one that came at the behest of rostyslav the boy who had been watching tiktok video before the missile hit he had managed to escape his mangled apartment by climbing out a window and scrambling down the building s facade with the help of bystander but in the confusion he had been unable to locate his white cat belyash i wa more frightened for my cat he said and so firefighter once again climbed into the building a rostyslav his mother nadiia and a small crowd of onlooker gathered in the darkness below after about minute a firefighter emerged from the kitchen window a red and white cat carrier in hand inside wa a dirty and frightened belyash we re going home said rostyslav peering into the carrier when at last he and his pet were reunited not this home of course but everything will be ok the strategic village of klescheevka in russia s donetsk region ha been freed from ukrainian force the russian defense ministry ha said the volunteer of assault unit with fire

soledar after a relentless russian assault klescheevka which wa populated by just over people before the conflict had been heavily fortified by the ukrainian military it lie km southwest of the city

intelligence agency bnd is alarmed over heavy loss suffered by ukrainian troop in the conflict between kiev and moscow the der spiegel weekly reported on friday russian and ukrainian troop are currently vying for control of the strategic donbas city of artyomovsk called bakhmut by ukraine but the situation there doe not look particularly bright for kiev the outlet reported citing a secret meeting between bnd official and the german mp responsible for security decision the ukrainian army is currently losing a three digit number of soldier every day in the fight with russian force der spiegel said citing data reportedly presented by intelligence official during the closed briefing earlier this week earlier this week the time reported that kiev had sent poorly equipped troop with little combat experience to defend artyomovsk read more kiev sent poorly equipped troop to defend key donbas city the time if russian force manage to seize the city it would have serious consequence for kiev the bnd warned adding that control over artyomovsk would potentially facilitate major russian advance deeper into ukrainian held territory the city of artyomovsk ha become a stronghold of the ukrainian army in the year since the coup in kiev it is part of a kilometer long defense line created by the ukrainian force during the intervening year russia claim sovereignty over the city along with the rest of the donetsk people s republic which joined russia in october after a referendum kiev rejected the vote a a sham the city remains a major logistics hub for ukrainian force in the region and ha emerged a a focal point of the conflict for both side in recent month russian troop have achieved several victory in the area over the last several week taking the city of soledar and the strategic village of klescheevka among several other settlement a they seek to encircle artyomovsk the pentagon ha announced that it will send stryker armored fighting vehicle to ukraine the first such transfer of the versatile eight wheeled weapon from u s military stockpile to a foreign country the strykers will be joined by bradley infantry fighting vehicle and other weapon a part of a billion military aid package for kyiv combined with the bradley announced for ukraine on jan the package will give kyiv the equivalent of two armored brigade worth of vehicle according to a statement emailed to reporter thursday evening according to the u s army there are different variant of the stryker some are built primarily to move infantry soldier in and out of battle while others are designed to carry weapon like millimeter mortar to provide fire support others carry medium and large caliber weapon for direct fire on enemy troop with millimeter cannon or even larger millimeter gun strykers were initially built with flat bottomed hull which proved vulnerable to improvised bomb set to detonate underneath them by insurgent in iraq in response the army phased those vehicle out with newer strykers fitted with a v shaped bottom similar to those used on mine resistant ambush protected vehicle which are also called mraps exactly which version or version will be provided to ukraine is unclear u s army leader decided in the s that the service needed a more mobile strike force that could go anywhere in the world in just four day that meant they needed a vehicle that wa well armed and armored while still relatively lightweight and small enough to be carried by a c cargo plane the stryker wa chosen a the vehicle the army could build that force around they first saw combat in iraq in strykers are le heavily armored than bradley and at to ton they weigh far le than the bradley which can weigh a much a ton according to a report from the congressional research service while bradley run on tread which offer excellent traction over uneven terrain strykers run on eight wheel which can still function even if they have been hit with bullet or shrapnel strykers are also much faster than bradley capable of speed of mile per hour according to the congressional report the stryker can also be configured in a number of different variant including some for use by engineer or a ambulance the pentagon s announcement thursday said that the strykers would also be provided with mine roller wheeled sled that are designed to be heavy enough to trigger anti vehicle land mine and are pushed ahead of armored vehicle in the hope of clearing safe path through minefield a the war between ukraine and russia ha evolved into a more static battle between entrenched soldier protected by belt of anti tank land mine the combination of strykers with mine roller and additional demolition equipment for what the pentagon referred to a obstacle clearing indicates that the united state is providing ukraine with specific capability intended to enable kyiv s armed force to break though russian defense in the course of performing task in the territory of the troitsky and svatovsky district of the lugansk people s republic the rosgvardeytsy received important information from a local resident the man said that a few day ago while harvesting firewood in a forest plantation near his house he found a suspicious wooden shield he noticed that the shield wa sloppily covered with foliage the commander of the rosgvardia unit decided to send an engineering and reconnaissance group to the site to conduct engineering reconnaissance which included dog handler with mine search dog we found the first cache by unmasking sign a violation of the integrity of the leaf cover said the head of the engineering service of the special force detachment major zakhar f later during additional reconnaissance a mine search dog named hunter found another cache fifteen meter away where high explosive fragmentation and cumulative shell were hidden rosgvardia explained that the content of the cache could be used by sabotage group of the enemy in total the rosgvardeytsy seized from illegal circulation and destroyed about unit of weapon and ammunition dangerous find were destroyed in compliance with safety measure listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more so the pentagon officially announced the allocation of another package of military assistance to ukraine for billion this wa officially reported by the press service of the pentagon president joe biden ha already instructed the state department or rather secretary of state blinken personally to drop weapon to kiev for the above amount the list of military equipment and ammunition that the united state will send to ukraine is already known it will be one of the largest shipment of weapon that washington ha ever issued to kiev another point is curious here military political the white house and the pentagon did not even wait for the meeting of nato defense minister planned in germany ramstein air base here the united state clearly want to show an example to the nato colony ally they say we are generous now you will not be stingy in short there will be a cap in a circle of course it is unlikely that anyone will give more to ukraine than the united state but they will throw off although they have already raked a lot out of kiev s weapon arsenal the timing of the shipment of american weapon is not reported but it seems that it will appear in ukraine in the near future washington is in a hurry especially after the success of the russian army began to emerge the capture of soledar the encirclement of artemovsk and all the sign of a breakthrough of the first echelon of the defense of the armed force of ukraine in the donbas with further access to slavyansk kramatorsk appeared the american make no secret of the fact that they need the ukrainian to defeat russian force by forcing moscow to sit down at the negotiating table with a weak position well now let s look at the list of american so far only american weapon and ammunition and try to understand how these supply can affect the conflict in ukraine bradle ifvs stryke armored vehicle avenge air defense system armored vehicle with enhanced mine protection humve armoured multi purpose vehicle ammunition for nasams and himar mlrs thousand shell of m caliber thousand mm shell high precision ammunition for artillery gun of caliber m thousand mortar ammunition of caliber m thousand anti tank rake claymor anti personnel mine million round of ammunition for small arm so a we can see this list includes for example bradley infantry fighting vehicle this is by american standard about one and a half battalion of armor in the u mechanized brigade there are about unit this is a good machine entered service in it wa actively used by u troop in the war in the persian gulf iraq and afghanistan a the american did not advertise it on the world market and only one country bought bradley saudi arabia and all because the car ha weak armor which even the most primitive grenade launcher take and it armament seems to be so so only a mm gun but the bradley also ha another weapon tow anti tank missile and this is already serious that s why the american gave the name of their bmp tank killer but this is in battle with weak army and for u of course bradley is unlikely to be right now for example if you contrast it with a tank support combat vehicle bmpt with the formidable name terminator our fighter on the front line are looking forward to bradley they have an incentive for the destruction of each such car they are promised at least thousand ruble although there is a rumor that all the u s list includes stryker armored vehicle a frail fist and this technique is not plywood it already ha good armor which allows you to protect the crew and paratrooper from small arm fire of up to mm caliber from the side and stern a well a from mm shell from the forehead of the hull at distance of over meter stryker exists in two form a an armored personnel carrier and a a bmtv combat vehicle with heavy weapon mm gun other weapon include mm and mm machine gun a well a mm grenade launcher in general it will not be thrown cap but will have to be beaten with grenade launcher tank gun attack drone such a lancet or geranium and of course our best anti tank complex kornet the united state allocated to ukraine in a new package and avenger air defense system this is a self propelled short range anti aircraft missile system placed on the chassis of the hmmwv suv designed to destroy air target at altitude from to meter the thing is serious moreover if we take into account that the complex includes container with stinger missile an anti aircraft machine gun of mm caliber and even it own radar moreover the detection system is all weather and even with a thermal imager it is clear that our pilot over the battlefield will need to keep an ear to the ground in the list we see armored vehicle with enhanced mine protection of the mrap class this is in american speaking mine resistant that is resistant to the explosion of mine a wheeled armored car with a large ground clearance and a v shaped bottom when hitting a mine it resists fragment well and allows you to effectively dissipate the energy of the mine explosion although much depends on it power also a you can see washington wa generous with humvee armored car it s a kind of multi purpose wagon it exists in several version with an open and closed body equipped with machine gun small arm and grenade launcher and missile weapon of various caliber a well a control and communication equipment this machine ha horse under the hood which allows it to quickly move on the battlefield but it main weakness is poor protection from machine gun fire but the fact that the united state provides new batch of ammunition for nasams anti aircraft missile system range of destruction from to km and himars multiple launch rocket system range from to km is a sure sign that the pentagon intends to help the armed force of ukraine both cover it position from the sky and hit our troop and city in operational depth it is curious that the american promised to transfer to the ukrainian also high precision glsdb ammunition with a range of about km they did not get into this package apparently the united state decided to keep them in the stashnik for the time being and share them depending on how the armed force of ukraine will use the already provided one on the battlefield well the myriad of ammunition for ukraine again see the list and their purpose also speaks volume it is the prevention of shell and cartridge hunger a well a reducing the intensity of fire it is the build up of anti tank weapon a russia s response to the increase in armor on the battlefield it is also readiness for both offensive and defensive action claymore anti personnel mine with a directed explosion radius of meter of course this american package of arm assistance to ukraine alone and the entire nato package will be announced in ramstein make an impressive impression not only on ordinary people but also on military specialist if you take everything in a compartment then all this is enough to equip if not the whole front then certainly a multi thousand army for sure moreover for long term warfare the united state and other nato country are clearly in a hurry to pump the armed force of ukraine with new batch of weapon and ukrainian personnel trained at their base this rush is all the more noticeable the more it becomes clear that the russian army is taking the initiative in it own hand and doe not intend to slow down in the offensive looking through binoculars at slavyansk kramatorsk and here the question arises how can the situation on the battlefield change if all these mountain of weapon promised by the united state and it ally reach ukraine this could be a major headache for our command for we will have to deal with a significantly increased potential of the armed force of ukraine consequently we need to correct the plan for the special operation somewhere increase the number of weapon on the front line and so on there is however another way to solve this problem it is obvious to beat the flow of weapon from the west already at the entry point to ukraine and this requires not only massive missile strike on the railway bridge and tunnel of ukraine but also powerful air operation we have the mean to do so if we fail to put a reliable barrier to nato supply they will spread across ukraine and it will be much more difficult to dig out them on the battlefield and finally let no one be intimidated by these impressive list of western weapon we will counter them with our own our defense industry ha long switched to a special mode of operation the military industrial complex plow a time requires listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more we paid attention to the subject itself during the operation there ha already been a similar case here you can assume anything we don t expect to find anything dangerous for u first of all we are in a hurry to save the patient s life when they found this object there wa no fear this is our usual job military surgeon lieutenant colonel vitaly ivanov told reporter after he took off his bulletproof vest the patient wa taken with multiple shrapnel wound to the soft tissue of both leg and a penetrating wound to the abdominal cavity to the kirov military medical academy st petersburg when the doctor removed the bandage and opened the wound in the soft tissue of the right lower leg protruded they saw a fuse that could detonate at any time commented on the footage of the operation in the ministry of defense of russia body armor is a necessity in this operating room the end fuze of a mm mine can easily injure multiple people saving a life in body armor is doubly difficult especially realizing that in one motion you can activate the fuse of the mine which ha settled in the muscle but military doctor conducted the operation in normal mode at the moment the patient s condition doe not cause concern among doctor in the practice in vitaly ivanov such an operation is not the first last fall surgeon in bulletproof vest removed part of a mine from the body of junior sergeant nikolai pasenko when a mortar shell exploded the shank separated from it this part of it with a stabilizer became an independent munition with a plumage like a dart she struck a soldier in the shoulder the wound could have been fatal but he wa saved the fighter wa born in a shirt commented kp in the ministry of defense kstat there are case when serviceman were hit by three kilogram mortar shell they hit the body but didn t explode one of these case took place in the leningrad region during the great patriotic war at pogostye red army soldier nikolai bystrikov wa wounded in the shoulder by a mortar mine a baby sized mine crushed the humerus stitched his shoulder and broke her left thigh this case wa reported on march by the newspaper red star listen a well how soon will the general battle in ukraine take place more during a special military operation there is a place for love kindness and our smaller brother the military rescue abandoned cat and dog who is taken to the unit and who is attached to relative and friend ulyana skoybeda collected story from the front when almost the entire unit of the fighter saved a dachshund named sossisych and attached the cat marfa to the mother of the deceased commander of the reconnaissance company of the volunteer battalion and ulyana got the diary of a mobilized doctor who picked up a cat on the front line and told how he served with him diary of a mobilized doctor well friend my name is ignatius and i am from the city detsovska i think it s understandable why i m distorting the name and the city by profession i am a resuscitation doctor the military department is behind him which is why he received a summons october october i m there the wounded are brought here to provide pre hospital care a lot of wounded blood pain and the tool to put it all away resident of the city that have come under fire are also brought to me medicine and equipment are few we give our best we sleep for hour oct it s a tough night i don t have the strength there is only one small joy we got a cat damn he know where he s from here there s not much left alive around but this little friend is now like a piece of normal life for me if they throw it to another place i will ask to take it with me i ve never had anything alive in the house other than fish a a child somehow they did not start and then i wa afraid that i would not cope because i wa always at work and now i realize i m an idiot it s more likely that they care about u than we care about them they entertain when there are heavy thought in the head warm the soul lying on the chest and most importantly cause love and kindness kindness is lacking when you see

zone of the special operation they were going to tighten the screw they will start with a ban on civilian car in the troop then they will confiscate smartphones and tablet and finally they will begin to shave their beard the wave of indignation rose so strong that even the acting head of the dpr denis pushilin made a statement saying that he personally requested the commandant s office but they have not yet received any order but the rumor became more and more specific there were already people who personally saw the order to put civilian vehicle on the army register with black number i repent i joined the wave of popular anger i didn t understand the following on the frontline is a real shortage of transport my sniper friend have a kilometer approach to position the same amount back and a a rule with lying down and waiting for shelling and the guy carry a three meter rifle ammunition water food a weather station binoculars rangefinder thermal imagers all in armor and helmet i walked with them i know how the tongue hang on my shoulder in the summer sniper threw up and bought themselves a zhigulenok and what now the motherland will ride on it and they will again walk it s just that people on the front line have real fear that they will no longer see the car they bought or accepted from volunteer if they are taken on the balance of the unit next is the ban on smartphones on the front line sorry but how to use for example quadcopters without them non statutory beard looked secondary against this background beard can be survived i wrote an angry post about this in the telegram and immediately received a response from a scout of the vostok battalion with the call sign fox dima hello you chased a wave there about beard phone car and general who press poor soldier according to the charter dim you re wrong i can put everything on the shelf reasonably and without embellishment and so it turn out that only one side is right which is brought to life tomorrow i will still be in donetsk then i will leave for the front i met the fox during the assault on azovstal i know how his intelligence unit fought i know how he planned impeccably accurate operation and he always participated in them i know that he is a scout by specialized education he received it before in kiev he saw iraq and afghanistan but from the first day of the russian spring he wa on our side his opinion is expensive we settled in one of the donetsk cafe for a liter of coffee and milk i suggested let s start with car in my post of righteous anger i gave the example of sniper the fox agreed come on i ll start with a specific example pvd temporary deployment point in a front line settlement there is a company conditionally people every soldier want to go to the store to a familiar young lady and everyone i emphasize doe not want to leave the comfort zone how much do zhiguli cost now and the salary about thousand for an old but still living car and the salary is under thousand or more well we bought thirty zhiguli and where to put the standard equipment now and how to mask it if in front of the ldpe is now parking at the supermarket the second point is discipline ldpe is not a base where there is a barrier and control therefore the soldier at any time get on his car and go where he see fit in the village the sale of alcohol is prohibited but the soldier is no longer afraid of this the fox sigh heavily i sigh too and how do the column go now because of these car fox asks himself sometimes the column stand because the torn zhigul broke and the soldier cannot throw it because he bought it for his own do you understand what a standing column mean and how it can end and one more important point guy you represent the russian army do not behave like a herd of makhnovists the ban on personal vehicle in the combat zone is also insurance against looting the last word fox is pronounced with pressure and in syllable okay but what about pickup and jeep that volunteer buy for unit they are issued for a specific person so that in case of loss it can be removed from the number and the man leaf it under his a mine they sent me a a result these pickup do not serve but ride there are no vehicle in your sniper unit and there are cloud there is only one way out putting on black army number legalization whether a fighter is adorned with a beard mine is decorating fox tell me he always ha a neatly trimmed espanolol beard always what is near ugledar what is near mariupol the fox develops his thought i m on my officer s id with a beard what are the question i think it s about appearance in general there are character he lived on the heating main mobilized beard to the waist braided pigtail and ring like a viking you just wash there will be no question for you i m going to get into the trench tomorrow according to the forecast the temperature is plus can you imagine what i ll be like in an hour but i ll change my clothes after the trench the fox talk about two extreme on the front line the first is the homeless style the second is creative okay no one will tell you anything in the trench but if you re walking around town with a bob marley squad sewing the fox sarcastically remark i saw in volnovakha how the military police reacts to such people the first time he just make a remark if i don t understand i m sorry the fighter wa in a non statutory uniform no there isn t we have half of the army in the statutory pixel half in the statutory cartoon someone wear a moss camouflage that s how i am the bos get into the position because one good knead and you re without pant i carried three pair of good shoe for mariupol and finished in factory boot we ended the conversation with the main thing the allegedly impending ban on

i wa on the defensive post near kominternovo where the previous composition of fighter wa cut out by the ukrainian drg sabotage and reconnaissance group i listened to hour long music in headphone so we listened i report the fox began officially there is a legend that when you press the button with the airplane in your phone you cut into the airplane mode you hide in the house september at ugledar i move from our position towards the enemy but the headquarters call me and say command stop they say where you re going now thirty phone are beating accordingly our phone are also visible that s what you want to turn off a modern phone is primarily a tracking tool the only option is a phone from which the battery is taken out okay but what about controlling quadcopters with map no one ban gadget completely but they must be in the hand of certain people used for combat not for entertainment here i am an officer coming on rotation to the trench and i see that there is a soldier watching a

komsomolskaya pravda told about the situation in the area of artemovsk around which the pincer of the russian army are shrinking today the wagner pmc and yevgeny prigozhin officially announced the village of kleshcheyevka it is located south of artemovsk ha been completely taken under control you can treat such news differently there are local success there are small one and there are larger one for example near the small village of prokhorovka in the nazi broke the ridge during the operation on the kursk bulge similarly kleshcheyevka may be a small village but on the scale of the entire operation it can play an important role we have many such village ahead some will be taken a a result of the formation of boiler some by heavy assault action a in the case of kleshcheevka but today pardon the pun there are tick around artemovsk thanks to this success today on the northern flank of these pincer we have taken soledar the village of sol and rudnik on the southern kleshcheyevka through which you can already slowly move towards the highway connecting artemovsk and konstantinovka from soledar and from the village sol storm troop move towards paraskovievka this by the way is the very settlement where the famous mine are located in which wagon with small arm from the great patriotic war are stored at a depth of meter and from paraskovievka it is already possible to go to the next supply line of artemovsk leading to slavyansk there are still road that lead through chasov yar to kramatorsk and i think that chasov yar will become the next inhabited point after artemovsk which will be taken by russian troop but first of course it will be necessary to deal with artemovsky it is a well fortified city the enemy is still sitting in it and he continues to prepare for street fight this can be seen in their video that hit the network they prepare thoroughly that is there will not be an easy walk but again exhausting city fight where the more motivated opponent will prevail and the wagnerian showed that in street fight they have no equal yet naturally it will be necessary to divert force to stop the threat from the north so that ukrainian troop do not enter soledar and they can because zelensky continues to pull unit in this direction so most likely pressure from lysychansk to seversk can go from the personnel unit of the armed force a we approach the next fortified area it is likely that the enemy will form more and more line of defense a little further we observed this during the battle for rubizhnoye when they were entrenched in severodonetsk and during the battle for severodonetsk itself when they were fortified in lisichansk and having rolled back from lisichansk they fortified themselves in seversk and so it will continue they will resist and rest until they prepare the next line of defense but everything will depend on how much resource will allow the offensive to continue the capture of the defense line which go from avdiivka to slavyansk druzhkovka konstantinovka kramatorsk most likely is not the most immediate prospect the ukrainian were well fortified in avdiivka and now when we are gnawing out the position we see that everything there is poured into concrete they ve built concrete bunker that artillery doesn t take therefore the unit of the first corp are conducting heavy assault work by the way not only wagnerian know how to storm position and city the first body on this also ate the dog you can remember how they courageously took the sand and now there are battle for vodyanoye i do not know what plan the top leadership ha but it is obvious that even in the event of the liberation of the entire donetsk people s republic it will not be possible to completely eliminate the threat of shelling of the same

ukraine is ready for a dialogue with russia but only if it is based on universal principle of international law said the press secretary of the ukrainian leader sergei nikiforov kyiv ukraine when the blare of the siren rang out over the loud speaker the student in a school in central kyiv quickly rose from their desk packed their thing and filed calmly down the stair behind their teacher but this wasn t a drill amid the darkness huddled in the narrow hallway of their basement shelter student chatted among themselves some used the light on their smartphones to continue working on classroom assignment they would remain in the shelter for nearly two hour until the threat of a potential airstrike passed it is the new reality for the schoolchildren age to who still attend class in person at this large public elementary and high school in ukraine s capital although class resumed in september a relentless barrage of russian strike targeting the city since october ha crippled the country s power grid caused rolling blackout in kyiv and offered the latest challenge to education during wartime we hope this will not last for a long time said olena romanova who ha been the principal of the school for the last decade we also have a generator but since the school is large it cannot meet the need of the entire institution initially the school struggled to adapt and some student grade faltered she said but the school is doing it best to adapt to the new obstacle school across the ukrainian capital have shuttered for january amid ongoing power cut and m romanova said teacher have been offering extra lesson online to try to keep student up to speed but a visit to one school in the city in late december before the winter break offered a window into the hardship these child need to overcome and their determination to continue on with parent and teacher doing what they can to provide the kid with some sense of normalcy there are normally child enrolled in this school but in december some class were only half full a many student are opting to study online and some parent believe it s safer for their child to study from home some student are living abroad after fleeing alongside million of other ukrainian but continue to dial into class on the flip side some new student have joined the classroom displaced from battered community closer to the front line in ukraine s east the school requested that it exact name be withheld for security and privacy reason but few aspect of the education process are untouched by the war with russian strike a constant threat high school student receive first aid training at school during last month s visit a group of high school girl practiced applying tourniquet and bandage on one another for now though the blackout remain the most pressing concern the school s generator is limited to how much power it can provide m romanova said it s enough for online class it s enough to keep the light and internet on she said but it s not enough to run the school cafeteria since it u electric stove and the generator isn t powerful enough for them a the power went out the hungry student at the school were disappointed when the chef olena sulyma told them that the food hadn t arrived yet she ha been working in this cafeteria for year but lately she ha had to get more creative in how she provides hot meal for the hundred of student here amid the power outage she and chef at other school nearby that have similar energy issue have been partnering with another local school where there is still electricity they can cook the meal there and then bring them to their own school ukrainian are inventive with thing that bother u that s why our school chef try to adapt m romanova said so we adapted and it s not an issue at the moment the kid are always full despite the hardship many of the student prefer to be in school one girl taisia said she prefers to be alongside her classmate even if it meant regular trip to the basement shelter i can t stay at home alone she said but when there is an air alarm and i m in school at first i feel calm but then when i see in the news that something is approaching i feel uneasy and we go to shelter their parent become unsettled a well while this particular school ha not been targeted a number of educational institution across ukraine have been when the siren go off warning of the potential for an incoming strike many parent rush to pick their child up from school more than educational institution had been damaged by bombing and shelling by the last week of december

each day maria who is in the th grade log on from her family s apartment in kyiv at a m and continues with her lesson until p m then she attends lesson at a rhythmic gymnastics school and hope to study physical education at university but rolling power outage have forced her to find creative way to complete her assignment when the light flicker off for me it is very difficult to study because sometimes there is no electricity and i need to boost my knowledge she said adding that she is preparing for her final exam later this year sometimes she head to a nearby store that ha a generator and wi fi and electricity available on a recent afternoon a the power at home cut out she took a photograph of an essay she had just completed and sent it to her teacher using the mobile internet on her phone sometimes she drop off her assignment in person still she and her family think it s best for her to study from home there are also other reason for distance learning her mother maia lavrynenko explained when there is an air alert in school everyone go to the shelter and when you are at home you can continue to study even during the air alert staying at home is no guarantee of tranquillity though in early december there wa a drone strike near their home the whole sky wa red there wa dark smoke everything wa black after the older m lavrynenko said the house across the road swayed despite all of this normal life at school carry on the teacher held a pajama party for the younger student on the last day of school before the start of the winter break they clutched stuffed animal and giggled in their onesies the older student also held a holiday party and shared snack and tea m romanova the principal said it is important for her to maintain this positivity for in person schooling

beautiful life dance wa cut short many of those who managed to escape turned up at m gerlivanova s shelter their eye were like glass she said in early january the whole world watched a the ukrainian orthodox church of the moscow patriarchate wa expelled from the kiev pechersk lavra the shrine wa given to schismatics from poroshenko s ocu but kiev is not just the mother of russian city it is also the place where prince vladimir baptized ru but will orthodoxy remain in ukraine now the head of the human right center of the world russian people s council professor of the moscow state linguistic university roman silantyev said this on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda within minute our conversation took an unexpected turn it turn out that there may soon be no orthodoxy in ukraine everything will be supplanted by a completely new religion what it will be called scientist have not yet decided roman anatolyevich how to explain the seizure of the kiev pechersk lavra kiev follows the path of the bolshevik after the revolution then the church wa also separated from the state which did not prevent them from acting in exactly the same way a lot of parallel can be drawn true the method have become even more rigid the persecution of the russian orthodox church in ukraine began when poroshenko came to power in oh no this wa under gorbachev when the soviet union began to crumble that is somewhere in then the seizure of church by the uniate in western ukraine had already begun the orthodox were expelled and now it ha become even more fun in the country there is a whole crowd of schismatics led by the poroshenko church which found formal patron in istanbul what to expect next i am generally surprised that the ukrainian orthodox church ha not yet been liquidated and large scale repression have not begun but i think it will happen the bolshevik also did not immediately begin to shoot everyone at first they created renovationists a now the istanbul poroshenko schismatics they stated that there are good orthodox christian who are for them for progress but then they were also eliminated and then the church is liquidated the ukrainian authority do not see christianity a such a an ideology or a basis for ukrainian ideology it already ha it own religion which ukrainism most likely it will be called so in our textbook that s what it s based on neopaganism and quite satanic in nature so if god forbid everything work out for them and they still last year there then they will have esoteric nazism christianity will be pushed out of the elite simple paganism is a set of god perun odin yarilo and what is neopaganism it differs from the traditional one in that it is completely fictional it is based on fantastic work that are passed off a historical source the same myth about the ancient ukies that dug up the black sea well we laughed at that and there it went into the school curriculum that is some of our contemporary come up with a completely unrealistic fantastic history of their ancestor and form a new identity from scratch where did that come from it began in the soviet period story about the unique ukrainian people that they were almost the first to create a civilization on the planet we also had this but thank you they did not allow u to enter university or school and they allowed it a a result in ukraine pseudohistory eventually became dominant this is clearly seen in the propaganda which doe not use christian symbol but pagan one magic in full growth here is a regiment of nationalist azov a terrorist organization banned in russia ed conducted a ritual of burning their comrade in a boat this is how a new inherently anti christian religion is formed it s certainly not about love it s a religion of hate her whole fuse is against the moskals who must be destroyed because without this it will be impossible to live normally this is the cult of power the cult of warrior they are trying to borrow it from the viking this is already clearly visible in the ukrainian army the army elite doe not hide their view the head of their armed force walk around with hitler s and pagan symbol and it s going to go to everybody else pretty quickly a in the third reich where the enthusiasm for neopagan occultism went from the elite and then began to spread to other segment of the population christianity will be supplanted and at some point will remain only at the level of rural parish and the country s leadership will no longer be christian but ukraine wa still considered a very churched country on the one hand this is a plus on the other hand there is an ultra high percentage of schismatics and sectarian and all these neopagan sect were massively present this permeated culture literature even science that s how the new religion ukrainianism wa formed and under kravchuk and under kuchma and under yanukovych this process went completely unhindered and if there had been no maidan and then resistance to it this national pagan project would have gradually absorbed both crimea and donbas people would think the same way a in lviv i can t imagine that there are adequate russian people there once there were completely russophile odessa and kharkov but what now none of the president of ukraine ha tried to stop or change the aggressive offensive of ukrainianism how long it take to convert people to this new faith hitler tried to do the same thing but he didn t have enough time they did not have time to create a full fledged religion of the third reich now it is called esoteric nazism in the case of ukraine it will be ukronazism or the same ukrainianism scientist will choose the exact definition but in wartime this process is greatly accelerated we observe such change in a year that used to take a decade i believe that another three or four year will be enough and there will already be a full fledged structure real chaplain priest will appear the idea of azov will become dominant actually it s a forge of personnel it is considered an elite unit and when the elite unit which everyone look up to conduct it ritual the rest will copy it it s kind of a hint to the rest of u that s how we should do it what can prevent this just u if you let them develop it will be what i described to you our task is to stop this disgrace and faster who do you have in mind state of russia yes historically only the state ha saved orthodox christian when at the end of the xvi century there wa the union of brest litovsk the orthodox in the territory now called ukraine at that time of course there wa no ukraine at all went underground a a result it wa possible to resolve the situation only after the accession of these territory to russia the only way to turn the tide there are still similar precedent in the world you can think of the khmer rouge it wa in the s of the last century in cambodia the khmer rouge came to power and said that wearing glass is bad living in city is bad believing in anything at all is bad and began to kill everyone who did not meet these criterion in three year they exterminated about three million people so history know such case but it s still okay of course the people fought back with the third reich too everything is over and with ukraine it is also clear how it will end the question is when and at the cost of what loss the question is rib roman anatolyevich if a new pagan religion is being built in ukraine why then wa the kiev pechersk lavra handed over to pseudo orthodox schismatics we could go straight to the gentile so they ll destroy it why do they need laurel for now the schismatics will be given and there it will be seen in a few year it turn out that there wa a temple of perun on this place and it is necessary so to speak to restore it although maybe they will not demolish it maybe they will combine pagan custom with christian one so far they have made a completely logical step they created a church for themselves and selected the kiev pechersk lavra for it soon the pochayiv lavra will be taken away and the svyatogorskaya they will just wait for the people who can protect them to leave the country or sit down listen a well zelensky

question from all compatriot from donbas in the morning i woke up to arrival the house shook i mechanically look at the clock in the morning presumably highrs several piece got into a shopping center on ilyich avenue this avenue the busiest highway at the entrance to donetsk there are even traffic jam on it the armed force of ukraine did not accidentally choose such a time i quickly pack up and

blood clot cut with glass i ask the most important thing the engine is intact whole whole it even start there s not much to tell my namesake military retired by age and health i wa driving to work a flash the car crumpled but did not turn over dmytro belief that ukraine is taking revenge on donetsk for everything for the fact that he once rebelled for soledar for arriving at a high rise building in dnepropetrovsk although it s not our fault but who care on the other side of the front line revenge is the general opinion of all who gathered near these smoking ruin a woman come up to u his name is elena a system engineer retired see press store i had a friend who worked in it but my friend is a day off today and her shifter wa late for work and she saved herself and saved people they usually open at am second birthday what can i say but pharmacy wa not so lucky a muscovite talk about the weather we discus shelling the kalinin district wa shelled only in the th year then a long break until december last year when the armed force of ukraine designated the kalinin hospital a a target firefighter spill water on the rubble the regime of silence ha already been announced several time but no one ha responded on the dirty roadside are the relative of the missing girl she wa definitely in the building i don t even approach them there is no strength to torture these people especially when there is still hope listen a well zelensky declared war on cheburashka more according to the british edition of the time the defense of artemovsk wa entrusted by strategist in kiev to foreign mercenary a well a to mobilized one who did not have time to undergo even initial military training another foreign publication the spanish el pais reported that soldier of two battalion stationed in bakhmut artemovsk abandoned their position and went to the rear because they did not receive ammunition well the washington post report that the recruit of the armed force of ukraine who are now being delivered to europe for accelerated training are urgently changing the goal of training from the basic principle of combined arm combat they are trying to teach them the skill of action in a large scale offensive about why the kiev regime is trying to close the hole at the front with few or completely untrained fighter whom it also refuse to properly supply and whether those few thousand rambos which are now being hastily prepared in the west will help on radio komsomolskaya pravda we talked with the director of the center for military political journalism vladimir orlov training newly conscripted previously untrained fighter for competent urban combat wa previously a long process how can it be just accelerated the american it seems will still try to conduct such an intensive course of combat training with the ukrainian which will prepare fighter who are limitedly trained for combat operation yes of course they will be taught all the basic in a few week they will be prepared for some minimal training to survive or to hold position the american have a very serious combat training in the army it cannot be said that after their training after their military intensive completely unfired inexperienced recruit will come out that would be wrong the yankee know how to train effectively in the shortest possible time the american are good at training various militant we have seen this in various military conflict including in the middle east but still special training is not week or even month of training the united state train special operation force well but yes it s not a quick process and they take already trained marine or paratrooper there a for the infantry the combined arm course of combat the american have not faced emergency mass training for a long time for many year they simply did not have such military task and by and large they are now reclaiming these lost skill for themselves america is better than europe at training the military quickly we need to understand that europe is in fact an appendage of nato america a the leader of the nato bloc of course drew all resource on itself and of course that america s military technical and military training base is much better wider than in europe in the east kiev thanks to these precocious will be able to accumulate sufficient force not only for defense but also for a counteroffensive their marginal norm ha not yet been worked out it seems that the american gave instruction not to organize a counteroffensive on soledar it wa a very meaningful decision despite the fact that initially ukrainian politician said that they would fight for soledar until the last ukrainian the situation ha changed dramatically in recent day now the american have instructed defense minister reznikov not to burn resource in this meat grinder they told him to just step back to give u the opportunity to occupy this settlement for what now they are hastily organizing a new front line on the approach to slavyansk kramatorsk there is a certain hill there at these commanding height it will be easier for the armed force of ukraine to hold this line of defense than it wa in soledar there in fact they were always under fire and the russian artillery could effectively strike at the firing point of the armed force of ukraine at the expense of those reconnaissance mean that were involved but there is still artemovsk before slavyansk yes now there is a question about bakhmut i think that an additional second echelon of defense will also be prepared it will also be on the commanding height behind bakhmut and the approach to bakhmut will be under tighter fire control from the armed force of ukraine bakhmut will be much more difficult to take than it wa with soledar the confrontation in bakhmut will be solved in many respect by artillery now the conflict is conducted by artillery mean the front on both side is very much saturated with unmanned reconnaissance uavs were specially created for this now every firing point is under close control and they are being hit by artillery if you look at the nature of the loss that we have what the enemy ha then up to percent are loss from artillery fire listen a well dmitry puchkov they want to kick russia out of the un and take all the country s resource under external management more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a

region to discredit russia a part of a grain deal this provocation by the sbu is aimed at accusing russia of creating a food shortage in ukraine there is evidence that about representative of the

operation and became a hero of rossi in st petersburg an officer from buryatia baldan tsydypov who saved colleague on a special operation is being treated detail military kp ru alexander kots analyzed the latest event in the donbas in his author s program on radio komsomolskaya pravda the commander of the joint group of russian troop in the svo zone wa valery gerasimov chief of the general staff previously this position wa held by sergei surovikin commander of the aerospace force and that s what hooked me from the very beginning of the special operation all it planning is the general staff this is gerasimov at the same time the very concept of the joint group of force and it commander appeared only in october then surovikin appeared who inherited a very difficult situation it is clear that he could not take and deploy the troop depleted and go on the offensive surovikin faced a difficult task to stabilize the front and pour the first force mobilized into combat formation it didn t go smoothly everywhere where there is an enterprising commander where he understands that with these people he should perform a combat mission everything is in order there they try to dilute the mobilized with fighter who have fought who can pa on their experience teach something tell them somewhere but unfortunately such enterprising commander are not everywhere today we hear the story of how the mobilized were transferred from prepared position to unprepared one where there is frozen water in the trench there are no bourgeois but having traveled across the entire contact line i argue that there are order of magnitude more positive example than negative one let s return to the castling in the command of the svo after all surovikin wa not completely independent he still coordinated decision with the general staff and sometimes a situation could arise when surovikin want one thing and the general staff tell him no let s do it differently and it turned out to be a situation of dual power and now the final decision rest with the chief of the general staff he is engaged in military operation surovikin apparently will be an emissary of the commander of the svo on the ground in the troop because the chief of the general staff is unlikely to be constantly in the combat zone and surovikin will be his right hand whether this is a demotion or an increase it doe not matter whether anything actually change in the system of military decision making it s just that now gerasimov will bear full responsibility for the course of the svo if we have any success he will be the father of these success if we have problem there will be no one to blame but him in this regard we have a sense officially we were informed that the personnel change are due to the fact that the task of the special operation will expand i do not think that these will be geographical expansion at the expense for example of belarus although we see that immediately after the appointment of the commander of the ground force oleg salyukov a another deputy commander of the joint group of force in the special operation zone he arrived in minsk perhaps this is part of the chief of the general staff s plan for this winter campaign because it is obvious that ukraine cannot but react to this he cannot ignore the transfer of our unit to belarus part of the reserve that could be used in the offensive in the south kiev is simply forced according to the law of military science to transfer to the north that is ukraine is easing it pressure in the donbas by stopping the hypothetical threat from belarus and i hope we should take advantage of that according to soledar kiev is now in the acceptance stage ukrainian military journalist butusov report that the city is actually lost but the mouthpiece of zelensky s office arestovich ha not yet explained to the audience why this is a peremoga victory in ukrainian can the armed force of ukraine counterattack soledar yes but we understand that for this they need serious force they need to remove them from somewhere there are no fool sitting in kiev but there is a confrontation between zelensky s pr and the military thought of the commander of the armed force of ukraine zaluzhny if the former win there will be a bloody and unsuccessful attempt to recapture the city if the latter ukraine will accept the loss of the city in any case soledar fulfilled his role both for our troop and for kiev we ground a huge amount of the enemy s manpower in this meat grinder inflicting a defeat comparable to mariupol and ukraine under this noise sought out new type of weapon from the west bradley infantry fighting vehicle and leopard tank let s not be kidding the more tank they put the greater the problem it will be for u yes these tank were used by the same turkey in the syrian conflict against the islamic state the organization is banned in the russian federation and isi burned these tank quite successfully that is these are not some invincible machine that will overwhelm our defense no but they of course can drink u blood what s after soledar obviously we will continue to put pressure on artemovsk bakhmut this is a very important node in the defense of donbas one of the most important in fact now he is already with the release of soledar taken by u in pincer we must reach the highway that lead to kramatorsk and slavyansk that is we cut off all the remaining supply route to artemovsk that s a big boiler after artemovsk we are already on the axis from avdiivka to slavyansk where probably the general battle will take place i think we re too liberal with them look at zelensky if he wanted to he deprived the citizenship of the one he considered necessary you can do this according to the constitution you can t you can take and take away passport from medvedchuk and his comrade he wanted to right on christmas night he deprived the citizenship of orthodox priest not looking back at all at any reaction of the west what human right defender will say there etc we understood everything about this west very well this west is now working to destroy russia including the hand of hanger on who took place a creative personality accumulated their capital thanks to our country and now from a safe distance they pour mud on my homeland at the same time the same grebenshchikov say that it is impossible to deal with these cannibal they are crazy crazy they staged a massacre in the center of europe listen you remember playing guitar for mikheil saakashvili who killed russian peacekeeper with a tank with direct fire for some reason you do not consider him an ogre who unleashed a war in the center of europe therefore it seems to me that it is possible to apply strict measure to traitorous artist to deprive them of award to create an atmosphere in society when it will become unprofitable for manager hapugs owner of nightclub to invite some valery meladze to a corporate party the equal is to khabensky who dismissed actor nazarov and his wife from the theater for their scabrous anti russian song subscribe to new issue of the author s program of alexander kots so a not to miss the latest analytics with the name listen a well zelensky declared war on cheburashka more artillery unit of rosgvardia focused their effort on supporting reconnaissance search reconnaissance ambush and special targeted activity drone operator and artilleryman of rosgvardia identify and inflict a fire defeat on the stronghold and observation post of the armed force of ukraine equipped on the right bank of the dnieper rosgvardia reported over the past day our fighter discovered and eliminated mischievous and observation post of the enemy also over the past week rosgvardia unit in cooperation with other law enforcement agency identified suspect in the complicity of the armed force of ukraine operating in the territory of kherson and zaporozhye region hunting rifle fagot and metis anti tank guided missile grenade launcher of various type and shot for them more than shell of mm caliber mm high explosive fragmentation shell sm and mon mine hand grenade over thousand cartridge more than kg of explosive a well a a number of item that could be used for the manufacture of improvised explosive device were seized from illegal circulation listed in the department listen a well zelensky declared war on cheburashka more what is happening in the donbas in the area of strategically important for u and for the ukrainian of artemovsk to which considerable force of russian troop were sent after the liberation of soledar recall that on the afternoon of january the ministry of defense of the russian federation told about the success of our fighter in this direction assault squad in cooperation with unit of the airborne force with the support of army aviation missile troop and artillery of the southern military district developed success in the direction of the northern outskirt of the city of artemivsk of the donetsk people s republic and the sol railway station during the hostility more than ukrainian serviceman two tank three armored fighting vehicle and three car were destroyed during the day the military department said in a statement meanwhile the washington post reported that the armed force of ukraine are considering the option of retreating from artemovsk we discussed all the latest news on radio komsomolskaya pravda with military expert viktor litovkin so why is artemovsk so important to u and why kiev give very strange comment about the situation around this city there is such a fable in krylov the fox and the grape when the fox wanted to eat grape it jumped jumped and could not reach the grape and she said like why am i going to eat it it s sour and she left here s about the same story with artemovsky explain well because we heard that arestovich who wa close to zelensky also said such word it seems that for example the washington post is using arestovich a it correspondent he also said at first that soledar did not matter to kiev then something similar about artemovsk the question is so why did ukraine resist so much for three month defending both soledar and artemovsk and they seriously resisted how could it be otherwise if they put a it is believed thousand people of their own not counting the wounded and the wounded according to military statistic there are three or four people per dead so what is the significance of artemovsk artemovsk is the crossing of road and railway thanks to these road to artemovsk soledar to seversk ammunition fuel and lubricant and reservist were constantly delivered to the armed force of ukraine that is why it wa very important but not only near artyomovsk a well a near soledar there are salt mine huge premise where ammunition fuel and lubricant of the ukrainian army were stored even tank were there infantry fighting vehicle self propelled artillery installation and even a hospital these salt mine stretch for huge distance up to kilometer they are several floor high so it wa very important to take them specify our task in the area actually there were two other task that required mastering this arc the first is to move away from donetsk from makiivka and from horlivka the artillery and multiple rocket launcher of ukrainian militant and the second task the capture of these city open the way to kramatorsk this is the last major city on the territory of the donetsk people s republic still occupied by neo nazi that is we are planning a powerful offensive on kramatorsk that s probably what we can already talk about it s going to be a tough road but it will be much easier after the capture of soledar and artemovsk why do the west circulate statement about the organized retreat of the armed force of ukraine first from soledar then from artemovsk the west should report to it public about what the authority of the leading country are spending huge amount of money on settling the ukrainian conflict in the united state even in a number of medium outlet voice are already becoming louder that instead of helping ukraine they would take care of reducing the cost of gasoline of protecting the u border from migrant the authority need to make excuse somehow they send a huge amount of military equipment to kiev but for some reason it doesn t work well who is to blame here it turn out according to their logic the fault of the ukrainian military which doe not show themselves well on the battlefield and now we american they say have to suffer with their supply and training read also the russian defense ministry report success in the offensive on artemovs assault squad with airborne troop supported by aviation missile troop and artillery have entrenched themselves on the northern outskirt of artemovsk and the sol station more listen to the same way the west ha seriously taken up the rearmament of ukraine what problem this brings to russia more britain will not hand over apache attack helicopter to ukraine the military department of the united kingdom made it clear that these helicopter will definitely not fall into the next package of assistance to the armed force of ukraine which london will officially announce in the near future the ministry of defense of russia report on the success in the offensive of the russian army on artemovsk assault detachment with airborne troop supported by aviation missile troop and artillery entrenched themselves on the northern outskirt of artemovsk and the sol station russian president vladimir putin said that he positively as the course of russia s military special operation in ukraine according to him there is a positive trend during the cbo putin also stressed that russian fighter will be pleased with good result in the svo zone more than once the russian defense ministry confirmed a powerful missile strike on the military control system of ukraine and energy facility recall that from february the russian armed force are conducting a special operation in ukraine to protect the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the armed force of ukraine a well a to denazify and demilitarize ukraine russian president vladimir putin publicly announced the cvo in february last year also outlining all the main goal of the special operation the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the new year in ukraine began with a powerful missile strike on critical and military infrastructure moreover the russian military used tactic before which the ukrainian air defense wa completely powerless on january a missile strike wa launched on the military command and control system of ukraine and related energy facility all assigned object are affected the purpose of the strike ha been achieved the press service of the ministry of defense of the russian federation reported on the morning of january first on the morning of january several explosion suddenly sounded in kiev and kharkiv at the same time neither the air alert wa announced in the capital of ukraine nor the air defense did not work alarmed resident of kiev and the region tried to calm down the head of the kiev ovum kuleba the namesake of the foreign minister of ukraine who said that it wa allegedly just an object of the capital s infrastructure that caught fire kievans looking at one of the crater meter in diameter and meter deep were surprised by the destructive power of their air conditioner and decided not to believe kuleba a a result of these first strike not a single person not only killed but also wounded among the local resident did not appear from which we can draw an almost verified conclusion if the ukrainian air defense doe not work then civilian do not die it is noteworthy that in ukraine they immediately began to discus why the russian hit so accurately and powerfully zelensky s staff propaganda analyst who tried to explain that the moskalis had struck with s missile were sent immediately far and for a long time after conferring the society decided that either the dagger or the iskanders had arrived supporter of the dagger were later ridiculed because the air raid alert wa not announced and this is immediately done a soon a the carrier of this type of mig missile take off from the airfield it s like a conditioned reflex in independence we are now raising only one such mig and an air raid alert is immediately announced in ukraine and then the air raid alert wa just announced and the city and regional administration began to scare the population driving it into bomb shelter that in russia a many a strategist took off from airfield which can carry up to a hundred missile in total and several ship of the black sea fleet of the russian federation which can carry kalibr went to the black sea it wa announced that the missile are flying throughout ukraine and the ukrainian air defense is also beginning to work in all region that s where the people of ukraine got really worried we are asked to go down to the shelter since a massive missile raid work ppo air defense but we are not afraid of the russian they do not hit u civilian but our pvoshniki can easily ambush that s yes wrote a sensible author of one ukrainian but pro russian telegram channel and like looking into the water the first victim of the ukrainian air defense wa an apartment building in dnepropetrovsk but a it turned out the cunning and treacherous russian launched false target in the first wave to open the ukrainian air defense the ukrainian pvoshniki who came to such conclusion were ordered to silence all operating radar and not to unmask their position and everything seems to be quite logical why spend precious ammunition on target target and even show your position but a soon a they had time to carry out the order there at that time it wa no longer the target trap that arrived but real missile in the second wave kyiv and region kharkiv and region odessa and region dnepropetrovsk kherson mykolaiv ternopil zhytomyr chernivtsi ivano frankivsk lviv vinnitsa explosion sounded throughout ukraine which had not been heard in many city for a long time and electricity immediately began to be turned off and without any schedule now ukrainian should probably remember the founder of the peacemaker the ukrainian nazi anton gerashchenko thanks to our partner the sky over the capital ha become even safer ukraine is gradually moving towards the construction of it own protective dome he said this at the end of october in support of the word of the mayor of kiev who said on october that kiev received new air defense system that will protect the capital of ukraine already other system are standing and even newer one are promised and the energy structure of ukraine a a result of the strike of russian missile and drone is all shivering and squirming so one memory will soon remain of her moreover the russian military can use new tactic every time putting the air defense of ukraine in a deadlock every time but zelensky s team will be able to come up with something every time to explain why the moskals once again succeeded this time it wa explained to ordinary citizen that the air defense wa useless because in the fog the missile is very poorly visible well son did your lyakhs help you in a similar situation the old kozak tara bulba asked his wayward son how it ended with this son i hope everyone remembers and who say that at the present stage of history everything should end differently more than hour after a heavy duty missile built to sink ship exploded in a dense ukrainian cityscape of home and shop the light of emergency worker played across the rubble on sunday in search of life death wa easy to find a smoke and dust rose into the dnipro sky a light dusting of snow began to accumulate on five victim who had been pulled from the rubble and laid out in body bag in a small grassy area next to the destroyed building they were five of confirmed killed in a russian strike on a civilian neighborhood were injured and at least people remained unaccounted for even some of those pulled from the debris that wa once their home seemed to have only an uncertain grasp on life i have no word i have no emotion i feel nothing except a great emptiness inside one year old woman anastasiia shvets wrote on social medium an image of m shvets from the scene of the attack struck a chord with ukrainian across the country it show a young woman clutching a stuffed animal and a golden christmas garland a she stand in the ruin and wait to be rescued m shvets somehow emerged with only a small head wound and bruise on her leg but her parent she wrote on a verified account on instagram were still missing and her partner who wa serving in the ukrainian military wa killed in action four month ago the strike on saturday at an ordinary nine story residential building led to one of the largest loss of civilian life far from the front line since the beginning of the war and it prompted renewed call for moscow to be charged with war crime in an address to ukrainian on sunday night president volodymyr zelensky said it wa also critical to punish those who grease the russian propaganda machine he offered a warning to russian citizen in their own language your cowardly silence your attempt to wait out what is happening will only end with those same terrorist coming after you one day it is considered a war crime to deliberately or recklessly attack civilian population or place where civilian would be likely to congregate but moscow ha paid little heed to the international rule of war the assault on dnipro wa hardly the first time a ukrainian population center far from the front line including the city itself had been targeted since russia invaded in february russian strike on train station theater shopping mall and residential neighborhood have led to significant loss of civilian life a ha the shelling of city and town near the front line but image of the devastation in the central city of dnipro provoked anger and despair among ukrainian and the attack appeared to be part of a return to old tactic in recent month moscow ha turned the focus of it assault on infrastructure target that provide power heat and water apparently hoping to demoralize the country but for reason that remain unclear over the weekend russia launched dozen of missile at city across ukraine in two wave of strike that coincided with the orthodox new year and shattered the relative calm of recent day the missile that struck the building in dnipro appeared to have been a kh cruise missile also known a an x missile according to hanna maliar ukraine s deputy minister of defense she said it wa one of five of them fired at ukrainian territory that day the soviet era missile weigh about pound can be fired from long distance and are intended for anti ship operation they are also capable of carrying nuclear warhead ukraine s prosecutor general s office said the kh missile that appears to have hit dnipro could have been launched by only one russian unit the nd guard heavy bomber aviation regiment this type of missile lead to the greatest human casualty because the missile is extremely inaccurate the office said therefore the use of such weapon for target in densely populated area is clearly a war crime more than missile of that type have been used in attack on ukrainian territory since russia invaded including a strike on a shopping center in kremenchuk in june that killed people immediately after the dnipro attack pro russian news outlet and influential military blogger claimed that the apartment building wa not the target but had been struck by fragment of the missile after ukrainian air defense tried to intercept it but ukrainian force were quick to deny that and the evidence from the scene pointed to a direct strike on the building the armed force of ukraine have no weapon capable of shooting down this type of missile m maliar said in fact she said the attack showed the need for antiaircraft missile system like the patriot system that ukraine ha long been lobbying it ally for the united state and germany have agreed to supply ukraine with the patriot system and ukrainian force are to begin training on it in oklahoma in the coming week dnipro a city nestled against the river of the same name had a population of just under one million before the war began after moscow invaded it wa targeted by russian shelling but never occupied by it force and never the scene of frontline fighting the city ha been home to displaced people who have flocked to it relative safety even so dnipro ha been intermittently targeted by missile strike and since october when the russian assault on infrastructure stepped up a number have struck the city on sunday neighbor gathered at the site of the latest attack looking on in disbelief le than hour earlier

collapsed building a humanitarian tent city had sprung up with volunteer making sandwich and distributing tea and coffee to the hundred of rescuer and resident on the scene one tent had mattress

said mr zelensky said report had been coming in from dnipro all day we are fighting for every person he said the rescue operation will last a long a there is even the slightest chance to save life in video posted to social medium the scream of those trapped inside the demolished building reportedly rang out a dust filled the air and rescue team worked to the help victim caught in the attack at least people were injured including six child and at least two people were killed in the attack valentin reznichenko regional governor of the dnipropetrovsk region said on telegram the attack on dnipro came just hour after air raid siren rang out in kyiv amid a heavy layer of fog a a renewed round of missile fire struck the capital after two week had passed without a single drone or missile strike kyiv mayor vitali klitschk said explosion were heard in the residential area of the dniprovskyi district on the left bank of the dnieper river and that missile fragment fell to the south on non residential area of the holosiivskyi district where a fire broke out another house were also damaged along with a critical infrastructure facility on the outskirt of the city according to the regional governor oleksii kuleba though russia ha routinely hit kyiv with missile strike since the war broke out nearly month ago including an intense barrage over the christmas season the saturday strike were the first russia had launched at the capital since the new year kicked off ukrainian air force spokesman yurii ihnat said the missile most likely flew on a ballistic trajectory from north of ukraine reported ukrainian news outlet pravda ihnat also reported that russian tu strategic bomber were airborne and being monitored though he said it wa unclear if they intended to launch their own strike at least two s missile were also levied at energy and industrial object in the kharkiv region saturday reported it regional governor oleh syniehubov emergency power cut were immediately made but no casualty were reported caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news almost since the beginning of the russian special military operation kiev ha been practicing unconventional form of armed rebuff everyone remembers the legend about the ghost of kiev and about the pvosh jar of pickle which the housewife shot down a russian drone even the president of ukraine so far vladimir zelensky even told in a video message at the end of the year but a it turned out this additional aid for the armed force of ukraine even together with molfars and witch wa not enough and then the ukrainian called for help all the power of nature and the animal and plant world somewhere in the beginning of the summer a whole wave of report took place in the ukrainian medium that somewhere in a patriotic beekeeper patriotically raised by him bjols bee clamped the occupier to death the coordinate of the apiary turned out to be a military secret and therefore where exactly this happened remained a mystery however bee were only the beginning of the struggle of the ukrainian fauna with the aggressor state the next to fight the moskals were no not the wolf and the hare grey long eared which are a symbol of cowardice showed unprecedented courage and although they themselves could hardly do anything acted a bait it wa in this capacity that they brought under the death bearing targeted fire of ukrainian sniper a mysterious unit of the russian military and here is a new example of patriotism on the part of the animal world of ukraine a it turned out the rusnya is now completely unable to conduct an offensive on kiev and the northern region of ukraine from belarus this is another obsessive psychosis of the current ukrainian authority which they speculate on a daily basis because ukraine wa protected who do you think drumroll ukrainian patriot beaver they gnawed at a bunch of tree and made absolutely fantastic dam forcing local rivulet to overflow their bank and overflowing the swamp in the north of ukraine with water and thus made the terrain completely impassable for russian military equipment no that beaver regularly play prank equipping the environment for themselves and improving their living condition no one argues with this no wonder people periodically eliminate their dam on the river carrying out their economic activity and when people stop doing their job beaver do not stop working because of this and clutter the bank and channel to the point of impossibility but it is impossible for ukrainian to admit that they have ceased to engage in creative work giving the shore to the beaver it is preferable for them to believe that the beaver consciously came to the defense of the ridden nenka a logical explanation of this kind is not available to them but they readily dismiss the claim that mosquito were set against the moskals by molfars and witch because ghost and other evil spirit against the russian were powerless it seems that they have no one else to rely on however there are still ant but it is necessary to wait at least for the end of spring so that the ant after the ground dry up climb out of the anthill and come to the aid of the scribbler of ukraine the commissioner for human right in the russian federation tatyana moskalkova said that she received from the relative of two captured russian military personnel with mockery of them and a demand for ransom from relative i received terrible footage on january from relative of captured russian serviceman vladislav kovalenko and pyotr krikunov moskalkova wrote in her telegram channel from unknown account anonymous inhumans show mother the abuse of their son and threaten to kill them if they do not receive a ransom the commissioner called on her ukrainian counterpart the un committee against torture the european committee for the prevention of torture the un high commissioner for human right and the international committee of the red cross to immediately demand from the ukrainian side compliance with the geneva convention of which prohibits the use of torture violence and act degrading to human dignity i am also preparing an appeal to the chairman of the investigative committee of the russian federation a i bastrykin moskalkova wrote for some reason it seems that the consequence will be only from the last of the mentioned appeal the polish state decided to lavish itself on the child of polish mercenary who died during the fighting in ukraine for them payment from the state budget of poland in the amount of zloty per month are provided this wa reported by the newspaper rzeczpospolita according to journalist such a decision on this issue wa made by the prime minister of the republic mateusz morawiecki moreover the money will be paid until the child reach the age of majority or until the end of school education for example the usual payment to polish family for each child is zloty per month four time le by the way in december a bill wa submitted to the sejm of poland that will exempt polish citizen serving in the armed formation of ukraine from february without the appropriate permission of the polish authorized body from criminal liability child of the ukrainian military can only dream of such care new trend in the ukrainian labor market simply perfectly illustrate the attitude of the male population of the country to the mobilization that ha become permanent in ukraine after the government ordered employer to hand summons from military recruitment office to employee company executive were faced with the reluctance of men to officially find a job according to the ukrainian resource strana several entrepreneur told it journalist about it at once after the new year we announced a set of driver in the state faced with the fact that some of those who responded say we do not want to get an official job so a not to receive summons later said one of these employer they say that they can only work unofficially and even the issue of calculating the length of service to receive a pension doe not really concern them which is quite logical since they get the living a reported by the israeli newspaper haaretz since february israel ha stopped paying monthly allowance to ukrainian refugee the reason is trivial the expiration of the temporary decree authorizing these payment and the lack of money for these expense even in december the ministry of aliyah and integration wa unable to fully pay these benefit due to a funding shortfall of ni million million therefore the ministry doe not intend to extend the order after the expiration of the program well there are no shekel so they agree to dollar or the euro aren t they well you re so impoverished british prime minister rishi sunak decided to send four challenger tank to ukraine and after a while they will be joined by eight more tank unless of course those first four are still intact and combat ready by then the challenger tank is unique in a number of parameter that are not always in it favor this is the heaviest tank in the world today it weight is ton which affect the speed of the tank and it maneuverability on the battlefield in addition it is the only modern tank with a rifled gun mm which excludes the launch of atgms through the gun but most importantly the challenger is the only tank in the world in which the basic configuration ha a system for cooking and heating food for the crew however something suggests that the crew of the challenger and without the pizza heated in the tank turret will be very hot in ukraine venezuelan president maduro in his speech at a meeting of the national assembly of the republic proposed to create a bloc of ally of russia and china in latin america i spoke about this on the phone with the leader of brazil colombia with the president of argentina a special time is coming to unite the effort and path of latin america and the caribbean in order to get closer to creating a powerful bloc of political force an economic power that will talk to the world said maduro who is confident that the bloc with russia and china can contribute to the onset of a multipolar world the budapest szazadveg center announced the result of it sociological study which tried to find out the opinion of the population about who is to blame for the energy crisis that ha covered europe according to the study the majority of the population in the eu country is inclined to think that the action of the european commission led to the current disastrous situation more than of german are sure of this in other eu country the majority of the population think similarly but there are also supporter of other answer option but the three country stand out greek croat and german are the least divided on this issue in these country and of respondent believe that the action of brussels caused the energy crisis the study say moreover recently this indicator the guilt of the ec under the leadership of ursula von der leyen ha increased in all three country a they say you can fool one for a long time not for a long time for everyone but for a long time for everyone it s impossible head of the state security department of lithuania darius jauni ki said that all russian and belarusian are a potential threat because even among the representative of the opposition there are recruited by the belarusian kgb there are not one not two and not even three and it s the same with the russian the lithuanian national opera and ballet theatre abandon the work of russian classic and removed prokofiev s romeo and juliet and stravinsky s the rite of spring instead they will show performance about the beautiful lithuanian princess and the ballet the trial based on the eponymous work by kafka the estonian rescue board dismissed an employee for supporting a russian special operation in ukraine a approving statement about the svo were found in the employee s account on social network and the estonian police department ha already dismissed employee for a similar reason this information is especially for those who are now cry about the dismissal of nazarov from the chekhov moscow art theater about what is now happening in the zaporozhye region on radio kp told a member of the main council of the administration of the zaporozhye region the chairman of the movement we are together with russia vladimir rogov vladimir valeryevich look russia s permanent representative to the un vasily nebenzia said that russia is ready for a scenario in which the goal of the military operation in ukraine would be fulfilled peacefully a a result of diplomatic negotiation his first deputy in this post dmitry polyansky confirmed that russia did not have the task of destroying ukraine the goal of the wwo is to ensure the protection of human right in the country are there real prerequisite for resolving the situation through diplomatic negotiation russia never wanted and did not plan to destroy ukraine ukraine cannot be destroyed it s like destroying siberia this is the same russian land historically this is clear to everyone and above all to our enemy and russia is ready for a peaceful settlement of the conflict that s understandable but the question is that the zelensky regime is not ready it ha completely different task his task is not to preserve ukraine especially the local population but on the contrary to shed blood a much a possible to strengthen the confrontation a much a possible and lead to grief suffering death and so on and the zelensky regime today ha a very difficult situation because you have to carol begging for more weapon more money because that s what it steal from on the other hand it is quite difficult to show a picture of success because there are no such success that s what the cipso is doing all sort of stuffing on various topic that soledar is under control everything is fine a planned retreat is being prepared they already impose outright fake draw some picture in photoshop come up with other nonsense actually what s there now if we are talking about the zaporizhzhya region it is important that now we are undergoing change on the front line which can be assessed with restraint and optimism yes we are waiting for the enemy s offensive in the zaporizhzhya region they have accumulated and continue to accumulate their force on the zaporozhye line of contact because the zaporizhzhya lb concern a little bit and the donetsk region up to the direction of pavlovka ugledar volnovakha etc and we have contact and intersection of different part there it is difficult to divide the zone of responsibility there because our soldier are doing one common thing the russian army rosgvardiya the st and nd corp of the dpr and the lpr now simply becoming part of the russian army and now we have begun to systematically destroy artillery depot where shell for artillery and missile for mlrs such a himars vilkha etc are stored this drastically reduces the intensity of shelling of our peaceful city our reconnaissance air defense motorized rifleman and artillery are working smoothly zaporozhye lb zaporozhye front this is a very complex symphony which play very qualitatively and well it s a big orchestra in every sense in addition to the russian army now we have more and more musician which we are also very happy about even today on the night of the old new year our guy poured very well gift to the militant of the armed force of ukraine the nazi on the zaporozhye lb and there again they raised a cry for civilian object and that there are no loss but my fellow countryman zaporozhians inform me from the field of directly opposite information about the result of arrival i think we should wait for the report of the ministry of defense true kiev s attempt to shell our city are still ongoing today early in the morning rocket launch were launched at melitopol and berdyansk the two largest city of the zaporozhye region in the liberated territory but russia s air defense worked out all the target in the air and no damage ha been caused to infrastructure facility especially to the life and health of people what should we expect in january and after it january is a very sad month for the russophobia regime in the southern russian land this wa also the case a hundred year ago when unarmed student were sent to certain death in order to stay in power at the expense of german polish bayonet and interventionists this wa also the case relatively recently with the donetsk airport when he wa already liberated from the nazi abomination and in kiev they said that some other allegedly some cyborg whom they themselves called so are standing and holding this airport and then they came up with the excuse that the cyborg survived the concrete did not stand zelensky by the way used the same manual only zelensky could not stand it and collapsed the wall and now everything is repeated one by one a it wa with the donetsk airport this is now happening with soledar and with dorozhnyanka in the zaporozhye region and with bakhmut and a lot of other small settlement that have already been liberated since the beginning of this year i think that s just the beginning of the year god willing for all of u it will be victorious over the past day the russian defense ministry reported on the coordinated action of assault squad marine and airborne troop during the special operation of the russian federation in ukraine along the entire line of contact our soldier with the support of aviation and artillery destroyed five sabotage group of the enemy and hundred of mercenary of the kiev regime former deputy prime minister of the russian federation army general anatoly kulikov belief that this winter the russian military will be able to radically change the situation in the svo zone which will lead to the approach of the final victory of the country s armed force in a special military operation in ukraine the state duma of the russian federation on january said that they want to see the current participant of the svo among future teacher and deputy in particular participant in hostility will be offered to teach in school in the liberated territory a well a supported when nominated for election at various level recall that from february the russian armed force are conducting a special operation in ukraine to protect the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the armed force of ukraine a well a to denazify and demilitarize ukraine russian president vladimir putin publicly announced the cvo in february last year also outlining all the main goal of the special operation the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the chief of the logistics staff of the russian armed force major general alexander dudkin visited the military clinical hospital of the ministry of defense of russia in moscow and krasnogorsk and odintsovo near moscow where he presented state award to russian serviceman who distinguished themselves during a special military operation to protect the lugansk and donetsk republic military personnel were awarded the order of courage medal for courage a well a medal for contribution to the strengthening of the defense of the russian federation earlier the decree of the president of russia wa held on the awarding of military personnel the russian defense ministry noted on behalf of the minister of defense of the russian federation we present you with well deserved award express our gratitude for your heroism and dedication in the performance of military duty we wish you a speedy recovery and return to service the armed force of the russian federation and the country

rehabilitation program are drawn up individually for each patient by specialist of a multidisciplinary team of doctor and continue after discharge former head of the ministry of internal affair of russia former deputy prime minister anatoly kulikov in an interview with the political observer of the kp ru alexander gamov gave an assessment of the latest event in the svo zone anatoly sergeevich i wish you good health here is the loudest news of the new year associated with a special military operation it wa headed by chief of the general staff valery gerasimov and the former commander is now deputy and a it seems to me now we especially need such a general s view how do you as these permutation if they can be called so in the leadership of the svo first it should be correct a they say use military terminology no take these message seriously that is to believe what come from official source and not what is distributed in social network properly track filter all the information on this topic a for the announced appointment of valery gerasimov a commander in chief of the entire operation i believe that this is a trained person he know his business well an already quite experienced general therefore i think that he should succeed we all expect from the new commander of the svo a feat associated with the skillful leadership and management of troop it is clear that after the new appointment we are waiting for some action most likely this is what our reserve were prepared for they are concentrated somewhere in a certain place some idea ha already matured what a they say only the supreme commander in chief and our military leader know this no one know that s right and he shouldn t know otherwise it will be impossible to achieve the surprise factor what will happen and how will it be this should not be advertised but the ministry of defense still disseminated such information in simple word that a set of measure is being developed to achieve the goal of the svo this is how it is in general what it could be this mean that reserve human and material resource have been tightened personnel have been equipped and their training ha been carried out commander are trained everything is thought out then in the name of the task set second echelon are formed in engineering term a they say the way of delivery of everything necessary have been determined this is a whole range of measure necessary for the implementation of the decision this in principle is the art of war and what kind of decision it is no one will tell you today no one will tell u and rightly so otherwise a penny price will be such a decision if it becomes known to the general public how do you as the fact that soledar wa released it s an event remarkable but it s not a win so far the operational line of defense ha not even been broken but only the tactical zone how to understand tactical this is the depth of the division if we take the very beginning so to speak from the border of what wa behind the dpr and lpr for the period of now in theory reserve should enter this breached defense zone for the further development of the offensive for entering new frontier that could be beneficial for the enemy that is we must occupy them so that he doe not have time in the future introducing fresh reserve to develop an offensive to achieve the goal of the operation this is demilitarization denationalization of ukraine all of this will be resolved it seems to me it may be that even before the snow begin to melt and the road spread again we will learn some i mean good news i think so the winter campaign will yield some result on february the title of marshal of the russian federation wa approved and during all this time it wa assigned only once to igor sergeyev when he wa minister of defense and after igor dmitrievich passed away we had a strange situation there is a rank but we do not have a single marshal now do you think it s right for an army general to command an army general solid army general maybe in the svo zone they still do marshal s work you know the title is not the main one in this case the main thing is skill command professionalism a for the command i wa a major and i commanded lieutenant colonel it all depends on your authority on your professionalism on your literacy a for the rank of marshal yes it is provided for by the constitution it is assigned in wartime in the defense of the fatherland now yes we are defending liberating our fatherland but in order to confer the title we must look at the result so that it doe not turn out that these star will be there a little with an unnecessary let s say shade veteran and participant of the svo will be in demand after the liberation of native russian city from ukrainian nationalist they should show schoolchildren in the liberated territory what russia is by their example said boris chernyshov deputy speaker of the state duma gd of russia deputy of the ldpr faction he told reporter about the proposal of the inter factional working group to involve participant of the special military operation in teaching in school in region liberated from the control of neo nazi a

opportunity benefit infrastructure should be created for them to help the new teacher the deputy together with the ministry of education and the ministry of science and higher education of russia also plan to develop curriculum and film for school in the liberated territory a member of the state duma committee on security and anti corruption mp of the ur faction sultan khamzaev said that the party in power will support the nomination of united russia participant a candidate in the election of the cvo participant and not only in the donetsk and lugansk people s republic zaporozhye and kherson region but everywhere we want to see more hero among the parliamentarian who are participant in the cbo in the rank of our party there are already many who in one way or another take part in a special military operation including deputy of the state duma and regional parliament we will fully support the participation of former military and volunteer in the upcoming election to legislative body in

like insect porter wheeling out thousand of painting soldier hastily wrapping them in sheet art expert barking out order and packing material flying everywhere they were loading such masterpiece which there are no more in the world a if they were garbage said the museum s longtime director alina dotsenko who recently returned from exile recounting what employee and witness had told her when she came back to the museum in early november and grasped how much had been stolen she said i almost lost my mind kherson mariupol melitopol kakhovsky museum of art history and antiquity a russia ha ravaged ukraine with deadly missile strike and brutal atrocity on civilian it ha also looted the nation s cultural institution of some of the most important and intensely protected contribution of ukraine and it forebear going back thousand of year international art expert say the plundering may be the single biggest collective art heist since the nazi pillaged europe in world war ii in kherson in ukraine s south ukrainian prosecutor and museum administrator say the russian stole more than piece of fine art and one of a kind artifact they dragged bronze statue from park lifted book from a riverside scientific library boxed up the crumbling year old bone of grigory potemkin catherine the great s lover and even stole a raccoon from the zoo leaving behind a trail of vacant cage empty pedestal and smashed glass ukrainian official say that russian force have robbed or damaged more than museum including several in kherson which wa retaken in november and others in mariupol and melitopol which remain under russian occupation with ukrainian investigator still cataloging the loss of missing oil painting ancient stele bronze pot coin necklace and bust the number of reported stolen item is likely to grow the plundering is hardly a case of random or opportunistic misbehavior by a few ill behaved troop ukrainian official and international expert say or even a desire to turn a quick profit on the black market instead they believe the theft are a broadside attack on ukrainian pride culture and identity consistent with the imperial attitude of russia s president vladimir v putin who ha constantly belittled the idea of ukraine a a separate nation and used that a a central rationale for his invasion it s not like one soldier putting a silver chalice in his rucksack said james ratcliffe general counsel of the art loss register a london based organization that trace stolen art this is a far far larger scale at one museum in melitopol a southern ukrainian city that the russian seized in the first day of the war witness said that a mysterious man in a white lab coat had arrived to carefully extract with glove and tweezer the most valuable object from the collection including gold piece from the scythian empire crafted year ago a he lifted out the priceless antiquity a squad of russian soldier stood firmly behind him in case anyone should try to stop him in each case of looting witness including caretaker security guard and other museum employee who said they had been pressured or forced to help reported a centrally controlled expert led operation shocked is not the word i am furious oleksandr tkachenko ukraine s culture minister said in a broadcast interview a he toured the looted kherson art museum visibly upset if they stole our heritage they believe

infrastructure plunging thousand into the dark vast swath of territory in the south and east remain occupied and one out of three ukrainian ha been forced to flee from home but even with the war

with no power or heat wearing glove and woolly hat indoors they make meticulous list of missing object comb through museum record and try to identify potential witness and local collaborator who might have helped the russian steal the ukrainian are also working with international art organization like the art loss register to track the looted piece everyone in the art market is on red alert to look

ukraine believed to have been stolen and others at risk including painting from kherson s art museum and scythian gold from melitopol the ukrainian accuse the russian of breaking international treaty that outlaw art looting such a the convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict created in the wake of world war ii the treaty call for signatory to prohibit

that the stolen raccoon wa now their mascot traveling with them along the front and had been named kherson that led to a popular meme on the ukrainian internet saving private raccoon this is hardly the first time that russia ha interfered with ukrainian art or culture for hundred of year during imperial russia and then in the th century during soviet time moscow constantly tried to suppress the

rearm ukraine what problem doe it bring to russia more in an assessment thursday the u k defense ministry said russia had likely redeployed some of the th guard air landing division of it elite airborne force vdv to the front line around kreminna in the luhansk region some mile north of where the most brutal warfare is taking place on the soledar bakhmut axis in donetsk now redeployed to the donbas and southern ukraine commander are likely attempting to employ vdv more in line with their supposed doctrinal role a a relatively elite rapid reaction force the ministry said defense official warned last week that russia wa looking to bolster it vulnerable defense in kreminna which could threaten it right flank around bakhmut the fight for soledar le than mile northeast of bakhmut ha drastically escalated in recent week after russia employed it wagner mercenary group on the city in an attempt to expand it eastward position in the donbas wagner group chief yevgeny prigozhin on wednesday said his force had taken all of soledar and killed ukrainian troop ukraine s secretary of the national security and defense council oleksii danilov on thursday warned that the deadly fighting is expected to ramp up even more a moscow prepares for a major counteroffensive caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news we discussed the latest military appointment related to the special operation in ukraine a well a the possible increase in the conscription age on radio komsomolskaya pravda with the director of the center for military political study mgimo professor alexei podberezkin which in your opinion mean castling in the command of the svo i wouldn t call it castling some might have had the impression some time ago that the general staff wa distancing itself from interfering in the affair of the svo in what sense well a it seemed to someone if he doe not completely distance himself from the leadership of the special operation then he participates in it somehow indirectly there wa even public criticism from the military decision were made from the commander of the operation to the level of the chief of the general staff and the minister of defense bypassing the operational management or the general staff itself well now when valery gerasimov chief of the general staff of the armed force of the russian federation wa appointed head of the operation everything fell into place so that s the way it should be i think so and since the commander in chief of the ground force oleg salyukov became his deputy in the leadership of the joint group a team wa formed that in my opinion corresponds to our traditional idea that representative of the stavka should be at the forefront of the special operation where certain area are seriously removed from the center of decision making i think it will they will manage together from moscow or separately from specific area the line of combat contact is about a thousand kilometer plus a section of the belarusian ukrainian border and all this is far from moscow everything stretch from kherson to belarus huge distance perhaps it is required that some team of manager be concentrated in one place but each is responsible for it own direction general surovikin who held the post of commander of the group since october is now gerasimov s deputy it s a downgrade i wa talking about the stavka representative in battle formation surovikin apparently will be although i know for sure that both salyukov and for example lapin have repeatedly visited these place probably now the main issue will simply be resolved more quickly which one one of the problem wa the multi stage preparation and decision making this delay wa criticized by many in the military i think now decision can be made directly by gerasimov based on the situation and how the scenario of a military conflict will change do not think that there are new big bos and everything will instantly change like surovikin who appeared in october it did not appear immediately with five or ten missing division but the element of his involvement took it toll that s going to happen here i think that decision will be made more quickly command and control system will begin to develop more dynamically i hope we will see the most optimal form of management for today the contact line is huge it section are very far from each other and there are objective difficulty here they raise the issue of raising the draft age to year i have always said that it wa impossible to evade the principle of mobilization readiness everyone must serve in our army necessarily for military service before entering the institute after that the contract the institute like for example in the israeli army the mobilization reserve is sacred for our country it is mandatory that s my position so a for age it doesn t matter not everyone wa always drafted at the age of in the ussr and in russia a reprieve wa given for the completion of education i served after night school this is important for the training of the missing link in the armed force sergeant and junior officer you can make a decision that people will be drafted into the army from the age of that this will be a universal military duty and give for various reason deferral for a year two three including the completion of education with the condition that you will then receive a military registration specialty and will be released a a second lieutenant or lieutenant listen a well special operation may end within two month more on the eve of the day of the formation of the investigative committee of russia celebrated on january the chairman of the investigative committee of russia alexander ivanovich bastrykin

investigative committee ha long spoken about the need to introduce mandatory genomic registration of all foreign citizen arriving in the russian federation with this in mind it is necessary to return to our proposal but of course taking into account the comparison of the financial cost of genomic registration with the cost of identifying suspect in the commission of crime after all the practice of investigating criminal case committed in condition of non obviousness show that a significant part of such crime is solved precisely thanks to molecular genetic study along with this it is advisable to work out the issue of codification of migration legislation by acquiring russian citizenship these people former migrant ed not only are they entitled but they are also subject to the obligation set out in the legislation in force one of them is the passage of military service in the armed force of the russian federation in accordance with the requirement in the context of a special military

all the command and control system of troop will change unlike the former commander of the svo army general sergei surovikin he will not have to spend precious time coordinating with moscow the plan for certain operation in addition he will always have two commander in chief at hand sergei surovikin aerospace force and oleg salyukov ground force the appearance of such a high ranking cohort at the head of the svo is a sure sign of the coming change at the front absolutely taking into account the fact that the west continues to actively pump the ukrainian army with weapon and mercenary the command of the svo will objectively be forced to extinguish this process to destroy the enemy s equipment on the road to the battlefield the essence of such a strategy is clear to make arm supply from nato country to ukraine meaningless we can expect a much larger use of attack drone hypersonic missile and tank once soledar ha been fully in control of soledar the command will not stop for there is another powerfully fortified area ahead artemovsk taking it will mean breaking through the first echelon of the enemy s strategic defense it is possible that in the near future this is the no task for gerasimov and his deputy but for this it is necessary to prepare very seriously personnel reserve military equipment ammunition and of course to outplay the opponent with a cunning plan gerasimov ha repeatedly shown that he can do it brilliantly one of the first task a already mentioned is to take artemovsk after soledar and there is expected a general battle for the complete liberation of the dpr and there the kiev general have long been preparing an impregnable fortress for our army it is very possible that during this battle there will be one of the turning point of the entire special operation by expanding the scale of the task to be solved perhaps we meant the full establishment of our control over the zaporozhye and kherson region a well a over the black sea region and the azov sea region and here you have both odessa and mykolaiv region read also why wa surovikin not demoted and what will change on the front line it is revealed what the reshuffle in the command of the sv mean what the reshuffle in the leadership of a special military operation mean more since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the armed force of ukraine lost fighter in an unsuccessful attempt to counterattack soledar in addition according to radio intercept company and battalion commander were absent in the unit thrown to break through the encirclement voenkor kots named the place where the general battle of the svo could take place he explained that this settlement serf a an important point of defense of donbas in ukraine an air alert wa announced in three region on january alarm sounded in poltava kharkiv and dnipropetrovsk region ukrainian ambassador to london vadym prystaiko said that kiev had withdrawn part of the troop towards the belarusian border the russian military shot down the ukrainian su this wa reported in the ministry of defense of the russian federation the russian military destroyed five ukrainian drgs in the kupyansk direction during the day they were located in the vicinity of the settlement of kislovka krakhmalnoye pershotravneve olshana and tabaivka russian troop killed more than soldier of the armed force of ukraine in the krasnolimansky direction russian force also managed to eliminate four armored combat vehicle and three vehicle the dpr announced the destruction of about five brigade of the armed force of ukraine in soledar the figure for loss do not indicate mercenary said pushilina s adviser rogov reported night explosion at military facility of the armed force of ukraine in zaporozhye according to him explosion were heard at facility where there were military equipment and ammunition depot firing position of the militant of the armed force of ukraine the russian armed force made a serious advance at artemovsk which wa largely due to the advantage in artillery ukrainian troop shelled makiivka in the dpr from mlrs three missile were fired a typical reaction of the kostrulegols to the loss of soledar in my personal life is maguchaya rassyya soledar can t take piv rock ahhh this is written to me from a country that ha not taken a single major city with a fight and just enjoyed the fruit of our mistake those who are now trying to downplay the scale of the success in soledar comparing it with the loss of territory in the kharkiv and kherson region are disingenuous to put it mildly yes in term of area this is a disproportionate scale but kherson izyum and kupyansk were left virtually without exhausting positional battle so without catastrophic loss on our part in soledar for six month combat ready unit of the armed force of ukraine were grinded kiev threw more and more brigade to hold the city which left the combat zone in the body of pickup truck and black bag yes soledar is a small town on the outskirt of the most powerful node of ukrainian defense artemovsk but here the armed force of ukraine suffered perhaps the largest defeat in manpower since the time of mariupol and this is the main success of the soledar confrontation lichka personal page in social network piv roku half a year in ukrainian read also the battle for soledar became hell for the ukrainian army that will be far away unit of the ministry of defense blocked soledar from the north and south the fighting is going on within it boundary more listen to soj the west seriously undertook to rearm ukraine what problem doe this bring to russia more in the ukrainian public after report of the blockade of soledar by russian troop there is a stunned silence it is felt that having believed in the story of the kiev pr specialist arestovich the majority refuse to believe in the loss of the city however indirect evidence of the failure of the armed force of ukraine can be found in the group of artemovsk ukrainian call him bakhmut and soledar recently the number of request for help to find serviceman ha increased significantly most of the missing served in the th brigade of the armed force of ukraine whose position were in soledar attention to all those who are not indifferent i ask you to report who know at least something about the soldier of the th separate airborne assault brigade of the nd battalion of the th company starchenko vladislav ivanovich my last time i wa in touch on december in the bakhmut area there were a lot of such appeal and on the forum of

journalist from artemovsk talked with the city administration and volunteer center and found out that there were no people willing to go deep into ukraine either in soledar or in artemovsk at the same time it is known for sure that in soledar where there are battle there are many civilian left we are no longer riding in vain said the head of one of the volunteer center how many time have you happened you come you try to persuade people and they send you like i wa born here lived here and i m going to die more on those the battle for soledar became hell for the ukrainian army that will be far away listen a well the west seriously undertook to rearm ukraine what problem doe it bring to russia more german anti fascist chairman of the foundation bridge of peace assistance to victim of war liana kilinch ha been helping donbas since and criminal case have been initiated against her in her homeland for this however liana doe not want to associate herself with today s germany she call her real homeland a country that no longer exists today the gdr that wa the beginning of our conversation for me personally the gdr is first of all the cool action film of the defa film studio with gojko miti a the most fearless indian and of course scarce shoe and household appliance and for you wonderful childhood and youth full accessibility of all type of education from the age of i wa engaged in figure skating then i wa cycling my brother went to music school and played a lot of instrument we tried ourselves in different field science language museum club they visited concentration camp to remember the horror of fascism they were friend with all people first of all with the ussr and how is it now in a united germany i m a mom myself and i know what my kid are getting now from school program removed the reading of book and poem the study of many science even child s singing an uneducated society is formed like biomass which is easy to manage even the history of the gdr must disappear it must be erased from memory the same brecht heinrich heine tucholsky when i quoted these classic then imagine fell under sanction because of this you got involved in politics no it s probably education my father and grandfather were member of the government my grandmother owned the largest library in berlin she opened it up to everyone and it wa forced to close when the gdr wa annexed do you think that the gdr wa annexed in sport school we were instilled with a sense of partnership and a sense of justice with the annexation of my homeland not only sport ended my section wa closed the coach wa fired why i started thinking about it and then i just started hating the system after all the gdr underwent a tough denazification and germany together with the nazi and nato invader it built it statehood in such a way that all those who served in the wehrmacht were not only rehabilitated but also given privilege so no one fought fascism here it wa simply hidden under the mantle of democracy and by the way during the annexation of the gdr there wa no referendum everything wa decided for u they took away our land and industry and annexed it to the federal republic of germany they made u second class german a former citizen of the gdr we receive pension and salary a third lower than german citizen our diploma despite their brilliant education are not recognized in the country so none of the east german occupies leadership position how did your foundation appear what s so special about it the foundation work with those country where there is a war but some project are conducted in parallel we emerged to help donbas and then expanded to yemen and syria cuba libya iraq lebanon peru and nepal the reason for the creation wa the beginning by kiev of an undeclared war in the donbas do not forget on may odessa the arson of the house of trade union journalist of our foundation were on the spot we saw all this with our own eye we cried the fact that the hydra of fascism raised it head here wa the declaration of war on russia i would like to note that president steinmeier wa later in odessa but ignored this crime thus he untied kiev s hand for subsequent atrocity of course our foundation expressed the sharpest protest we celebrated the th anniversary of liberation from fascism and the bundeskanzler merkel did not come to moscow for the first time member of our foundation dressed in t shirt with the inscription thank you for the victory laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in the alexander garden near the kremlin since that time our convoy began to move through moscow to the donbas tell u about this work for more than year we have made more than project many resident of the gdr studied in the soviet union we have many tie with kiev horlivka donetsk we started with the creation of sewing production in horlivka of course they also supplied food and clothing but we believe that the main thing is to create job let people earn money and feed their family we opened a school for integration the hostel for place wa renovated we supply seed material in order to grow crop ourselves locally we conduct sport event and cultural program they were just in the house of culture in horlivka when a rocket hit it roof why is your charitable foundation outlawed in germany since february of this year cash flow have been stopped convoy have been detained for special check our work no longer fit not only into the policy of germany but also of the whole of europe with it bestial russophobia everything ha been turned upside down allegedly russia is the aggressor and we are helping it in general this is the first egregious case in the entire modern history of germany when a charitable foundation is deprived of the status of a non profit association and the account is closed car with ukrainian license plate are on duty under my window the goal is to intimidate those who are called refugee but in fact they are notorious bandera member were told from above fa what is it if not the new gestapo now you have decided to finally move to russia i once again came to donetsk with humanitarian aid of course i never intended to stay here forever but it wa at this time in germany that everything began the law changed in just day and you were on a business trip at the time yes and i had a return ticket for october but the staff of the fund and the family and all acquaintance said stay in germany you will face a criminal article and i had to stay in russia with one bag and i repeat with a return ticket no one knew there would be problem while all this wa unfolding of course the deadline for submitting document ha already passed two kind people masha and vitaly brought me to the migration service fm but i wa denied an application for political refugee status i understand that civil servant have a duty to adhere to the law but i wa still upset and disappointed when i wa told that it wa better to apply for the status of an ordinary migrant but they persecute you in your homeland for political reason you are right and here i consider it useful and necessary to continue my activity to help donbas strengthen solidarity friendship and mutual assistance with russia various organization asked for this more than a hundred letter in my support came only from donbas maybe the problem is that the law on the status of a political refugee wa adopted in and need some kind of updating i have heard that work is underway in this regard in the state duma and the ministry of foreign affair of the russian federation but i do not know about the federal migration service and the ministry of internal affair of the russian federation the trouble is that my visa is already expiring and i m of course very upset because all of this in general is wrong after all i am not the only one who will only get worse with each new russophobic law that come out in europe these law will squeeze out russia s friend from everywhere they will have to say goodbye to their profession to their usual way of life and even to the motherland you will have to leave but where if not to russia so we need to solve this problem together it is necessary to create an anti fascist movement in order to fight together this terrible plague that is waking up in europe and threatening the whole world while the fighter of the pmc wagner are no longer conducting an assault but sweeping soledar official kiev is holding back with all it might declaring everything is in order i didn t screw up monsieur dmytro kuleba this is no longer a surname but a diagnosis give interview left and right in which he argues that the only option that putin ha is to lose the war deputy defense minister anna maliar is trying to suggest that the armed force of ukraine continue to hold and control soledar and the moskals allegedly storm it unsuccessfully this is against the backdrop of dozen of video from the ukrainian military itself running moaning cry losing their life in this pointless battle for a aleksey lyusya arestovich put it a town that doe not even have operational significance it is good for arestovich to sit in the studio and broadcast about a town that doe not matter of which we have twenty more in the donbas alone no le bad for those thousand if not ten of thousand who laid down their head defending such a trifle for the strategist lucy at the same time judging by the logic of action kiev despite the continuing victorious remark at the end of last year perfectly understood the doom of the ukrainian army under soledar and bakhmut and the best proof of this is the unprecedented mobilization which is carried out quietly without announcement but with a very frequent crest pull to the front all those who fall into the clutch of military patrol conducting real raid on the street of ukrainian so far city moreover according to the new rule summons can be handed over not only at the place of residence but in absolutely any place where a man of military age is caught in the network of the military recruitment office and often we are no longer talking about just summons but about literal capture and sending to the military recruitment office immediately after capture moreover military enlistment office in ukraine show real creativity and imagination in the organization of this process in dnepropetrovsk for example they cordoned off all exit from the ymz plant on rabochaya street and caught everyone going outside and indeed yuzhmash now practically doe not produce anything so why doe it need worker in chernivtsi the military frequently walked through the central market ukrainian already roughly understand what the appearance of military patrol together with the police mean and therefore they try to make leg at the slightest suspicion of the action go to mobilization so during the roundup the market demobilized in record time but the ukrainian military is not a bit of a about people they managed to get into their net in odessa the creativity of military recruiter went through the roof there patrol drive around the city in ambulance and seeing a suitable candidate rush at him literally on the go not allowing the car to stop when braking just capture group of american and now also russian militant the mobilized one doe not even have time to moan a he already try on camouflage and receives an assault rifle if he is lucky but the most inventive were still the military enlistment officer of the ukrainian capital they used girl in their work if not with reduced social responsibility then in any case not the most difficult behavior five people at once were led to a languid look and a generous offer to rest and relax at the fairy s house and they were surprised when with a small temporary gap they arrived at the door of the apartment where inside they were not waiting for a fairy at all but thug in camouflage which now they themselves will have to wear and because no one canceled the military trick rowing everyone they can reach not giving a damn about the reservation and the state of health a they say in ukraine zelensky set the task of mobilizing at least people into the army by spring while in january and february the number of mobilized should be at least people naturally the office of the president of ukraine and the government do not announce anything about such task and plan on the contrary they try in every possible way to refute the evidence of mobilization but no matter what malyar and reznikov say and on the street of their city ukrainian see not at all the picture that they are told in the telethon and zelensky in the nightly video message cemetery in ukraine are growing faster than those mobilized are being drafted into the army and men on the street of ukrainian city will soon become a museum rarity but according to kiev everything is calm in soledar and what is most paradoxical in this situation the majority of the population of independence belief in everything that zelensky and company are lying to them and in their mind they are already marching through red square p s just the day before zelensky in his video message said that soledar gave time to buy time but for what exactly he did not explain is it really for zelensky to speak online at the golden globe ceremony in hollywood where he again asked for money and weapon how many thousand ha zelensky buried for this opportunity nothing he ll put even more to the oscar read also brutal appeal under champagne ukrainian refugee staged a revelry in courchevel and summoned a spout ukrainian refugee with their festivity in courchevel were able to surprise even ksenia sobchak more ukraine is cry loudly kiev admits catastrophic loss in order to get even more weapon from the west ukraine complains about loss to beg for additional weapon more listen to soj the west seriously took up the rearmament of ukraine what problem this brings to russia more on january defense minister sergei shoigu appointed chief of the general staff army general valery gerasimov a commander of the joint group in the special operation zone in ukraine the former commander general of the army sergei surovikin became one of gerasimov s deputy two more deputy were army general oleg salyukov commander in chief of the ground force and colonel general alexei kim deputy chief of the general staff of course the most heavyweight figure in these personnel reshuffle is the chief of the general staff and then it s time to remember how he appeared at the head of the brain trust of the armed force of russia valery vasilyevich gerasimov from a family of hard worker he took the first step to the top of his military career a a boy at the kazan suvorov school graduated with honor with a gold medal he graduated from the kazan tank command school and then also with honor from the academy of armored force then and the academy of the general staff he trampled all the stage of growth in command and staff position in good faith not jumping over the bluff anywhere which is especially appreciated in the officer environment he began a a leteha platoon commanded a company battalion regiment division army and the most belligerent the th combined arm in the north caucasus which fought in the second chechen company he wa chief of staff of both the far eastern military district and the north caucasus he commanded the leningrad and moscow military district in he became deputy chief of the general staff in this position he allowed himself to oppose the adventurous reform of defense minister serdyukov and he paid the price for his intractability he wa sent from moscow again to command the military district for the third time this time to command the central district after serdyukov s resignation the new defense minister shoigu presented gerasimov s candidacy for the post of chief of the general staff to the president putin approved this proposal on november gerasimov wa one of the developer of the special operation for the peaceful return of crimea to russia in had a hand in the development of the current special operation in ukraine although on august the military prosecutor s office of ukraine declared gerasimov the main ideologist of the war in the donbas he wa declared arrested in absentia the russian defense ministry responded by saying that this wa a political provocation and the security service of ukraine wa a reserve of idiocy gerasimov is a hero of russia and a holder of soviet and russian order i have met and talked with the chief of the general staff many time but only once did i persuade him in an interview with great difficulty he explained his frequent refusal a follows i need to manage the troop and not give interview he is an unusually modest and taciturn man but all those who served or continue to serve under his command unanimously say that he ha a tough command acumen and the ability to make non standard decision listen a well the west seriously undertook to rearm ukraine what problem doe it bring to russia more on radio komsomolskaya pravda we discussed the situation around soledar with a military expert the head of the center for the study of public applied problem alexander zhilin they write that the battle for soledar have become hell for the ukrainian army and the question is what next kiev admits defeat the kiev side will do everything to mix this yes nothing is finished at soledar yet yes the russian army actually occupies soledar but part of the ukrainian army wa able to retreat in a controlled manner our super task is to take the height their understanding it is very difficult to take height what would you pay special attention to in this operation the first is that the guy showed tremendous courage urban fighting is hell for everyone involved it s such a physical and emotional intensity that god forbid so a for the further development of the situation i think the russian army in the direction of bakhmut will develop an offensive the fact that we came from the north complicated the action of the armed force of ukraine and there too a situation may arise when you can try to take the enemy into an operational environment the head of the dpr pushilin declares a turning point in the liberation of the republic a for the dpr the situation there will be greatly facilitated in term of the alignment of force and mean i understand pushilin he want to give a positive message to the resident of the dpr they are deathly tired of the war if the situation continues to develop in a similar way then the entire dpr will be under the control of the russian army but how will event develop further the opening of lend lease is ahead and it s hard to predict anything but i always bet on the russian soldier i saw in battle these are people who are able to crush everything in their path clarify about lend lease the point is that it will be a different nomenclature to a large extent offensive weapon and then what happens ukrainian crew have been trained for american f aircraft they weren t just cooked weren t they so these aircraft will still be delivered perhaps they will be operated from military airfield in poland that s possible it s possible we have to take some action yes and this is not only the supply of new air defense system to the troop there are a lot of other thing that with the beginning of lend lease should not come a a surprise to u it is not only about the quantity but also about the quality of weapon zelensky s adviser arestovich said that the capture of the destroyed soledar will not benefit the russian this person is in a state of great distress it task is to mitigate big trouble but it is difficult for him to deny a fait accompli the importance of the transport hub is difficult to downplay victory should not be too elevated to heaven but it should not be minimized either and even more so where so many month were cut for every square meter and a a result we reached other more advantageous position this cannot but be appreciated read also the main result of the battle for soledar the largest victory the feat of the fighter and black bag for ukraine voenkor oleksandr kots called the battle for soledar the biggest defeat of the armed force of ukraine since mariupol detail listen soj the west seriously undertook to rearm ukraine what problem doe this bring to russia more the battle for the city of soledar in the dpr have reached a decisive stage according to the ministry of defense of russia airborne unit blocked this settlement from the northern and southern direction the vks strike at identified target and assault squad are fighting in the city fighter of the private military company wagner are also fighting in soledar it founder yevgeny prigozhin said that the city had practically come under the control of russian troop according to him in the center of the city the militant of the armed force of ukraine were in the cauldron there is a battle however the press secretary of the president of russia dmitry peskov urged not to rush with assessment and said that the success of military operation will be achieved when the goal set by the supreme commander in chief during the special operation are fulfilled however dmitry peskov agreed that tactical success are also very important they come at the cost of the fantastic heroism of our fighter the presidential spokesman said therefore this is another reason for pride in those of our guy who do not regret either their life or their health on the spot meanwhile the armed force of ukraine continue to resist however a the main ukrainian pr specialist oleksiy arestovich admitted at some point the unit defending soledar flinched and ran now they are not fleeing but there were unstable comrade who fled he said on the air of one of the youtube channel they don t run because they retreat on the eve of the evening it became known that russian troop are shelling the artemovsk soledar highway this is the only way to supply the ukrainian group in the city with a shortage of ammunition resistance becomes absolutely unpromising and the resistance of the armed force of ukraine apparently is an attempt not to hold the city but to cover the withdrawal the battle for soledar became a real hell for the ukrainian army on the eve of the well known military commander alexander sladkov said on the radio moscow speaks that the armed force of ukraine suffer huge loss the enemy loses personnel tank infantry fighting vehicle on the eve of the evening ukrainian telegram channel citing source reported that the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valeriy zaluzhny reported to zelensky about the critical situation in soledar and insisted on the withdrawal of ukrainian unit from the city against the backdrop of the victorious statement that kiev regularly feed to the west this wa a difficult decision however the threat of encirclement threatened a real catastrophe it wa necessary to choose the lesser of two evil moreover in ukraine the situation in this direction caused increasing discontent regular post of ukrainian soldier appeared in social network that the command abandoned them in the soledar meat grinder to the mercy of fate a stated by the acting head of the dpr denis pushilin after the release of soledar good prospect will open up for the liberation of artemovsk and the cleaning of artemovsk in turn will mean hacking probably one of the most powerful line of defense of the armed force of ukraine in the dpr for russian troop a direct route will open to kramatorsk slavyansk city that can be called the key to the liberation of the entire territory of the dpr read also meat grinder for the armed force of ukraine and kilometer of salt tunnel through which the tank will pa what russia get along with the liberation of soledar voenkor kp ru alexander kots spoke about the battle for the city more listen soj the west seriously undertook to rearm ukraine what problem doe this bring to russia more the first clash near the small donbas town began in may and went on for almost half of the year military kp ru dmitry steshin tried to understand the significance of this victory and it consequence for kiev the fact that something terrible and unpleasant happened in soledar became clear from the activity of ukrainian propagandist they still feel at ease in our information space and social network the template for distribution wa hurry up to see the second army of the world ha finally captured the district center there wa despair in those scream that the volga tsaritsyn stalingrad that the unsightly prokhorovka remained in history because it wa there that the third reich broke the spinal ridge and it is not so important where this happened the german themselves were well aware of this military subtlety field marshal helmut moltke wrote in the century before last the goal of any operation should not be the territory but the enemy s army if the army end the territory will come by itself and for the clueless repeated once again the main object of operation should not be the territory or fortified point of the enemy but his army only it defeat can decide the outcome of the campaign soledar itself is indeed a very modest town with a population of people i survived two historical name bryantsevka and a very awkward brain drying and breaking language karlo libknechtovo in they settled on the human and understandable name soledar the fact is that under the city at a depth of meter there are colossal layer of rock salt of the highest quality you can pack directly from under the tunneling combine for sale despite the fact that salt ha been mined in these place since the th century so far only of the reserve have been mastered there are deposit of alabaster and refractory clay in soledar factory for processing and most importantly logistics a railway branch with the sol station and a major road junction everything that is needed for a large defensive node of the armed force of ukraine docked by a flank with another node bakhmut artemovsky and behind soledar and bakhmut there is a direct road to the largest agglomeration in donbas konstantinovka druzhkovka nikolaevka kramatorsk and slavyansk already in november when it became clear that the russian would not retreat and would break and grind the enemy the command of the armed force of ukraine started talking about withdrawing to kramatorsk which would become the main hub of ukrainian defense in the donbas the idea wa pushed personally by the commander of the ukrainian troop zaluzhny but did not find understanding in kiev where they are very sensitive to reputational loss it is under it reputation that ukraine receives money and weapon from the west and the soldier of the armed force of ukraine have to pay for this officially a announced by the command of the armed force of ukraine the battle for soledar began on august the russian troop here pressed the enemy unusually systematically and in concert that is together with the neighboring bakhmut not only head on but also on the flank gradually occupying the dominant height and suburban settlement turned by the armed force of ukraine into stronghold two city bakhmut and soledar by the new year were already in a semi encirclement a little later the road linking these defensive knot wa cut yes the first violin in these battle wa held by the musician from the wagner pmc but both paratrooper and guy from the lpr fought shoulder to shoulder with them it is curious that the entire information focus of late autumn and winter wa focused on bakhmut although the ukrainian press wa no le picturesque about the battle in soledar exhausting battle that are characterized by artillery duel aviation and drone and heavy flamethrower system were used at the same time the weight of the volley we had wa immeasurably greater already in early december ukrainian hacker began to complain in social network that artillery doe not support u almost simultaneously there were complaint about terrible loss it is difficult to name how much such data is always classified but you can understand by indirect data the fourth separate tank brigade about tank in battalion and armored personnel carrier and the th st nd and rd separate mechanized brigade with their communication artillery medicine sapper and engineering service etc were transferred to soledar from the so called nato reserve of ukraine according to a number of sign it wa the bakhmut soledar meat grinder that disrupted the planned offensive of ukraine in the zaporozhye region to melitopol and the crimea there wa no one to attack it is curious that it wa the western adviser who are fighting ukraine against russia who first understood the meaning of what wa happening in soledar bakhmut but they failed to put pressure on the political leadership of ukraine kiev also did not listen to it military moreover a serious conflict allegedly arose between zelensky and zaluzhny then the west decided to use pr a whole troop of western journalist from the most authoritative publication from newswick to the washington post walked through bakhmut and soledar all of them described the miserable situation of the armed force of ukraine the shortage of artillery and ammunition and finally the terrible loss but zelensky wa adamant like hitler at stalingrad he even stopped by bakhmut for a few minute before a voyage to the united state to reward distinguished zahistniks and quickly left leaving them to unravel their bloody mess in soledar the ukrainian army had a particularly hard time the day before the fall of the city the commander of the ground force of the armed force of ukraine colonel general syrsky came here he called the wagnerian professional but stressed that they have no success and also quickly left soledar everything became clear to everyone the first to falter were the foreign mercenary they were the first to report that the road between bakhmut and soledar wa cut and the city wa in a semi encirclement trying to save the remnant of the combat ready ukrainian troop the american cnn brought out a soldier from soledar and he reported the following the situation is critical the number of dead is high no one count the dead literally the personnel of our unit ha been updated by almost half we don t even have time to remember each other s call sign the speech wa anonymous so that the soldier would not be hurt in this planting of the west one could read it growing concern it need ukraine and russia to fight a long a possible if possible while maintaining the combat capability of the armed force of ukraine such a touching concern everyone understands that soledar will be abandoned everyone understands this what s the point of dying for him the zahistnik concluded everything wa already a foregone conclusion on christmas night soledar s defense were breached and on january the wagnerites reached the city administration building in all city assault this is a psychologically important object the attacker realized that they had won the defender had lost and they had to save themselves or die one of the soldier of the armed force of ukraine having reached the internet recorded a video in good russian language with a checkmate good evening we came out of soledar these meaning officer of the armed force of ukraine auth we were abandoned we wanted to get out yesterday and these escaped author officer s word nothing is worthless the video is short but it ha a lot of meaning the first meaning the armed force of ukraine unable to bear loss and pressure fled from soledar themselves the second meaning the officer fled first abandoning their soldier that is there wa a loss of control of the troop or simply the defeat of the enemy and not a systematic withdrawal unfortunately some of them managed to get out of soledar they withdrew not far and not close entrenched in kilometer from soledar at the limit of the effectiveness of the fire of the main artillery system in the city itself from to soldier of the armed force of ukraine remained surrounded kiev began to ask for a corridor for their exit perhaps they will come out on exchange but first captivity according to rumor in the neighboring bakhmut the mood of the ukrainian garrison is vile their flank from soledar is now completely open ours continue to advance the defense of kramatorsk is getting closer and there and slavyansk is a stone s throw away the creak of the wheel of samsara is heard the confrontation in the donbas return to it original sacred point listen a well the west seriously

depriving him of supply therefore now the situation is slowly striving for a turning point the chechen commander awaits soledar s release one of the key to the occupation of artemovsk is the release of soledar and according to the chechen commander apta alaudinov soon the city may come under the control of our military by the way under soledar in the salt mine there is another underground city in soviet time hundred and thousand of wagon with weapon were brought here and in the tunnel of the mine even tank can move freely so it is difficult to overestimate the importance of intercepting a populated area alaudinov report that the situation in this sector of the front is developing in such a way that the armed force of ukraine should think how they can withdraw at least the remnant of their force and mean russian prisoner are tortured with electric shock and a tooth is knocked out beating torture and execution became the norm of the kiev regime during the interrogation of prisoner the investigative committee of russia after the next exchange recorded the fact of the inhuman attitude of the ukrainian nazi to the military we are talking about methodical beating electric shock

organize rubble and this is done not by border guard but by serviceman with different form of clothing territorial defense unit and unidentified military formation the border committee of belarus reported that the border is guarded in an enhanced mode and border guard are ready to perform their task well the main thing is that neighbor do not massively begin to explode on their own mine and fall into their own ditch and then accusing others of their own stupidity is a favorite trick of zelensky s henchman in the west they see the light in kiev there is an authoritarian regime ted galen carpenter a columnist for the american conservatory belief that while the western medium fan the myth of self styled democracy a a free democracy the reality is that the regime is increasingly demonstrating authoritarian behavior but a the columnist note the western cheerleader of ukraine are not ashamed at all they continue to portray the country a a freedom loving democracy although evidence continues to accumulate that this is not the case carpenter note a number of decision of the kiev authority that do not fit with the image of zelensky he writes genuine democracy do not ban opposition party or shut down opposition medium they do not subject everything to strict censorship and strict state control he also cited other measure non compliance with legal procedure the

transformer now they are desperately needed especially acute is the shortage of device with a voltage of kv their weight reach ton the ukrainian grid u an old soviet circuit operating at a higher voltage than eu system and it is incompatible with western equipment well then what will you do with european supply listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the dpr people s militia stated that the loss of the armed force of ukraine exceeded people per day two

strategically important city in the donbas soledar and artemovsk bakhmut the first of them ha already been partially taken by russian troop and the armed force of ukraine are preparing to hand it over completely this conclusion wa reached by the war correspondent of komsomolskaya pravda alexander kots the russian military told about the tank duel with the armed force of ukraine in the donbas stoltenberg announced the depletion of military stock of nato and the eu due to assistance to ukraine in the donbas the epic battle for soledar ha ended the battle for another important city artemovsk bakhmut is close to the end what do we gain with soledar s release special correspondent kp ru alexander kots collected testimony about the last hour of the battle for this city it s very hard in soledar right now the situation there is more acute than in bakhmut the enemy attack in small group usually up to people armed with rifleman rpgs and bumblebee attack on our position are going on in wave ukrainian political scientist and officer of the armed force of ukraine tara berezovets sound the alarm this is not a complete encirclement but the normal supply of ammunition along the route is impossible it is critical for defense the main threat from the russian is the coverage of the city from the flank they will do everything possible to make their way to the track in the rear of soledar echo ukrainian military journalist yuriy butusov a sure sign that kiev ha come to the stage of accepting the inevitable these two always appear where soon it will be necessary to turn the evil loss in ukrainian into a peremog victory in ukrainian it wa the same before the abandonment of severodonetsk by ukrainian troop and before our capture of lysychansk a few day before another sensitive defeat ukrainian propagandist usually begin to explain that this or that city did not have serious tactical significance therefore it is better to leave it before you are completely surrounded the battle of soledar a small town of the dpr ha indeed reached it climax these day pmc wagner took it center but the ukrainian command continued to transfer reserve here and from the kherson region and from the svatov frontier in the lpr for the russian army starved for serious success the capture of this city ha both strategic and psychological significance on the one hand after a series of forced but no le offensive regroupings it is important to feel the taste of victory let it come at a high price on the other hand soledar is actually the northern outskirt of the most important node of the ukrainian defense artemovsk bakhmut which turn out to be in pincer through soledar also pas the line of defense to the north to seversk from here there is a highway near slavyansk the artyomovsk agglomeration is in fact a transport hub through which several military garrison of ukraine are supplied at once and the destruction of this hub is one of the most important task on the way to the next line of the enemy s defense the axis from avdiivka to slavyansk the capture of soledar of course will not be the turning point of the entire winter campaign of the special operation but this is a notable success in which the musician a the wagnerian are called show that it is possible to defeat the enemy even in condition when he is literally underground there are a lot of salt mine in the city their development began in the century before last surely everyone who lived in the ussr remembers a white and blue pack of salt sil for kopeck half of these pack for the whole huge country were mined here kilometer of underground communication salt tunnel on which if desired you can ride on kamaz or on a tank from the depleted mine even a tourist object wa created here where you can drive a ball on a football field at a depth of meter below sea level we are talking about size the grass doe not grow here the floor wall and ceiling are all made of salt listen to music in the concert hall and even improve your health in the underground sanatorium salt symphony they say that cool dry air saturated with salt ha a good effect respiratory and skin disease were treated here an even more interesting object is located in the suburb of soledar which is still held by the armed force of ukraine in paraskoveevka at the volodarsky mine at a depth of meter below sea level there are huge arsenal to which small arm were brought and preserved after the great patriotic war in i wa at the entrance of this mine then the unrest in the donbas wa just beginning however many already understood that there would be no velvet return to their native harbor according to the crimean scenario local resident organized a round the clock picket near the mine preventing the national guard of ukraine from exporting weapon for the need of the right sector no one doubt it serviceability a constant temperature regime and humidity level in salt mine are ideal condition for storage and there are stored three line mosin ppsh and pps submachine gun german mp submachine gun american thomson of the model mauser colt degtyarev and maxim machine gun imagine the working meter wide and meter high blocked by metal gate so one after another in one working there are several storage the length of each is meter there are just huge one where car would fit in in total there are thousand of wagon with weapon vladimir shanaev former head of the th storage department of the volodarsky mine told me according to him it is almost impossible to undermine these working although it is possible to overwhelm the entrance but armory of course were not the main target of the fighting no matter how cynical it may sound but now rubilovo is not so much even for the liberation of these city soledar and artemovsk bakhmut have another important role which ha already been nicknamed the bakhmut meat grinder here combat ready unit of the armed force of ukraine which suffer large scale loss are grinded zelensky is deploying more and more force to this front weakening other direction and allowing the russian army to prepare for combat operation in other part of the winter campaign and it main blow can be inflicted in completely different place what hopefully we ll see soon banned in russia organization listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country russian defense minister sergei shoigu began the first conference call this year by thanking all the serviceman both the participant of the special military operation and those who were on combat duty during the holiday who served a part of duty shift and daily outfit performed task in military hospital participated in the restoration of infrastructure in the liberated territory the head of the military department listed shoigu reminded his subordinate that taking into account the experience of the svo the supreme commander in chief set a number of priority task the main one is to take exhaustive measure to qualitatively update the armed force and increase their combat capability constantly analyze and systematize the experience of the action of our group in ukraine and syria on it basis to draw up training program for personnel and plan for the supply of military equipment the practice received by our troop should become the basis for improving combat training the minister stressed the speaker noted that this year the ministry of defense will continue to actively develop the nuclear triad the combat capability of the aerospace force drone an arsenal of modern strike weapon equipment and tactical equipment of personnel to the highest level everything that a fighter need should be modern convenient and reliable shoigu said modernization with the help of artificial intelligence technology will be subjected to the control and communication system and the work of military commissariat it is necessary to digitize database establish interaction with local and regional authority a well a industry update the system of civil and territorial defense organization we will also improve the mechanism for responding to civil initiative some of which of course deserve great attention the minister instructed after the speech the officer discussed plan for to build up the combat capability of the army which provides deterrence of aggression against russia and our ally listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country the plan of the command of ukraine included strike not only on the donbas but also on the region of russia in particular in rostov on don and taganrog this is evidenced by ukrainian map which were found by the russian military on abandoned position of the armed force of ukraine near avdiivka the commander of one of the unit with the call sign sanych showed these card to the ria novosti correspondent on them there are arrow shaded area and other mark that indicate the plan of the armed force of ukraine here is rostov on don mark route ria novosti quote the commander donetsk lugansk people s republic also kharkiv movement both in our direction and in the opposite direction this is the direction of movement either of the equipment or of the enemy s force and mean both in our direction and in the opposite direction therefore it is possible to determine the direction of movement of force and mean one of the direction is rostov on don taganrog perhaps they want or wanted to seize these territory the map were found during a search of the premise in which the command post of the armed force of ukraine were located they have already been studied by the special service and came to the conclusion that the mark were applied no later than july last year among the ukrainian nazi the idea that the rostov region kuban stavropol territory should belong to ukraine ha long been popular it turn out that these idea have already turned into concrete plan if we had given a slack in february we could have faced direct military aggression in the rostov region a well military expert and historian yuri knutov said the south of russia is a long standing dream of ukrainian nazi including in the power structure a far a can be judged the main plan wa to change the government in russia weaken u and tear u to piece on the map of budanov head of the main intelligence directorate of ukraine russia is allocated a very small territory these are of course only plan but if in february march attacking the donbas they would have succeeded they would certainly have moved to the rostov region with taganrog the beginning of the special operation disrupted these plan listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country kp the city of artemovsk aka bakhmut we successfully storm soledar wa almost released some kind of fracture went into the special operation for example the military officer of komsomolskaya pravda alexander kots although positive belief that this is not a turning point yupiy podolyaka i absolutely agree with alexander it s not a fracture to begin with soledar and artemovsk or bakhmut are not the main offensive operation a far a i understand which the russian command is preparing for the winter campaign this we can say is a grinding of reserve and a diversionary campaign which should first of all deprive the enemy of the initiative and force in order to parry the main blow but still the loss of artemovsk and soledar will inflict psychological loss on kiev break it this is also an important task but i repeat and kots i think is also aware that this is not the main offensive operation that is supposed to be in this winter campaign kp maybe you can clarify where the main direction are then and when we start attacking there podolyaka i really hope that during january we will find out about it but that s just my guess in fact that s what i m most worried about because near artemovsk near soledar mainly the wagner pmc work everything is well debugged there and our regular unit where there are now many mobilized have not yet participated in large scale offensive and where is the main direction of the strike it s not about the direction it s about the result kp ok what result for u can be considered victorious podolyaka defeat of the armed force of ukraine because let s be honest now in kiev they say that ukraine is not russia but if we look carefully they are just building an alternative russia colonial russia an appendage of the west it is for this reason that the west is helping this project and a long a this project ha an army it will threaten the real russia because it ultimate goal is the colonization of the entire post soviet space kp nevertheless there were success in the special operation after a long stomping on the spot and even the withdrawal of troop there wa a promotion why surovikin changed tactic podolyaka and the tactic have been changed and they have finally begun to fight in science not in spite of if for example we are on the defensive it mean that we are building this defense in a layered manner with trench with system of firing point if we look at the reason for our departure from balakliya and raisin we will see that they were all because we ignored military science we were on the defensive but we seemed to be preparing for the offensive and they didn t build point of resistance they didn t put minefield we had gap between the defense node of kilometer without trench without anything of course the enemy passed them in minute to our deep rear so we got the result now after the appointment of surovikin a commander wherever we do not expect to attack in the near future a layered defense ha been built how it work we see under kremennaya near svatovo the enemy there tried many time to break through the defense but nothing came of it that is we finally began to fight according to the rule the second most important point is of course mobilization because fight do not fight according to the rule and if there are no soldier you will still be bypassed we have saturated our line of defense with fighter and equipment and immediately the success of the enemy went away prepared by ivan grache read also meat grinder for the armed force of ukraine and kilometer of salt tunnel through which the tank will pa what russia will get along with the liberation of soledar voenkor kp ru alexander kots spoke about the battle for the city more kiev wa going to hit the south of the russian federation how a special operation prevented a ukrainian attack on the russian region military expert knutov said that the special operation violated ukraine s plan to attack the rostov region and taganrog more listen soj the west seriously began to re equip ukraine what problem this brings to russia more the ukrainian information group beregini which ha long been waging it secret struggle against the armed force of ukraine and the kiev regime published list of schoolchildren born in who were taken away in the autumn to study military specialty the list include boy in grade we have repeatedly said that this wave of mobilization will be much more serious than all the previous one politician here in ukraine have finally gone crazy and it seems that they have decided to recreate one child s organization in the last century an austrian artist also taught child how to show a gesture from the heart to the sun the artist died but our ukrainian politician remember this gesture and are now actively using it and it look like it s not just him they also remembered that child were mobilized in a neighboring country they were dressed in military uniform distributed faustpatrons and sent to fight the russian beregini s employee who published the list write they say that the faustpatrons have now replaced the javelin but the essence ha remained the same the nationalist regime seems intent on sending child to fight street fight with grenade launcher otherwise it is impossible to explain the document that we found in the possession of the military commissar which collect information about schoolchildren the foreign master of our politician thought that we would not know that they want to send our ukrainian child to the new hitler youth beregin said zelensky will distribute grenade launcher to the child and he will hide and why not this is exactly how hitler behaved in april he handed the child grenade launcher and he hid in the bunker there are thousand of photograph in the historical archive of german child posing in front of berlin with faustpatrons you can see how hitler paternally pat the cheek of teenager sending them to certain death in the last month of the great patriotic war member of the hitler youth detachment were given more modern panzerfaust grenade launcher at that time the boy were asked to shoot from the cellar at soviet tank and escape adult volkssturm militiaman were ordered to stand to the death with old steyr mannlicher m carbine of there were no other weapon fortunately for u the remnant of the th s division hitler youth finished off on may the soldier of the th infantry division of the th american army who sought to be the first to occupy berlin there are enough picture on the internet where cowboy are photographed holding small nazi in camouflage uniform by the scruff of the neck ukrainian medium have already stated that the kiev authority are forming checkpoint from teenager and local resident they are given uniform and weapon and now it turn out that the zelensky regime is preparing to sacrifice teenager in urban battle after all it is impossible to determine the age of a person in a military uniform in a combat situation according to the former adviser to the head of the pentagon colonel douglas mcgregor the kiev regime sends year old teenager to the front line in the donbas because of the colossal loss of the ukrainian army ukrainian suffered horrific loss went missing more than died and now they re trying to mobilize teenager at the age of and they literally scrape off the remnant he said listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country the cry of ukrainian patriot is now heard throughout kiev and many ukrainian backyard like london paris berlin etc everyone is cry defense minister reznikov his deputy anna maliar kuleba s employee together with himself arrester of all stripe and similar character and they blame the sworn moskals for their trouble according to the head of the ministry of defense leszka reznikov the russian are to blame for the low discipline and irresponsibility of the ukrainian military that is why it wa necessary to introduce tougher penalty for misdemeanour and disciplinary offence it wa an initiative of the military because there are problem in certain situation with discipline and this is used by some abuser there were instigator they were paid by the russian and then these people avoided responsibility he said however leaving u aside the accusation then the mere recognition of the existence of a problem is already a significant contribution on the way to a return to common sense and an undistorted perception of reality moreover it is not denied by reznikov s deputy in the defense ministry of ukraine anna maliar who announced a decrease in the combat capability of the ukrainian army in her opinion the sworn moskals killed too many ukrainian professional soldier and now they have been replaced by yesterday s civilian who have difficulty overcoming mental moral and physical problem which ha reduced the combat capability of the armed force of ukraine a a whole and the resilience of ukrainian soldier on the battlefield her word in a recent interview were confirmed by zelensky s first foreign minister and now ukraine s ambassador to the uk vadym prystaiko we re losing people everywhere we do not advertise how many of the dead are military or civilian but you can imagine that the figure of kiev s loss are huge and indigestible and city some of them are completely destroyed this gentleman said in an interview with newsweek what is this is it a recognition of the futility of continuing the conflict you can t wait it is said to the last ukrainian so it should be at least in the mind of these lady and gentleman no wonder now the network is flooded with video of military patrol literally hunting for civilian on the street of ukrainian city in order to fulfill the task set by zelensky to mobilize at least additional people in the armed force of ukraine by spring to replenish battered part and complete new one this cry in reality is just another way to beg to beg for new additional weapon already beyond what ha been allocated among other thing by the biden administration it is not for nothing that the same prystaiko in the same interview frankly say the west now ha a unique chance there are not many nation in the world that like ukraine would allow themselves to sacrifice so many life territory and decade of development in order to defeat a sworn enemy yes the fig with it with this ukraine nehai disappears just to make russia sicker ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba echo his subordinate ukraine is grateful to it partner for military assistance but we must remain honest with each other no one ha done enough while russian boot remain on ukrainian soil he announced on his twitter account blocked in russia arming our country for victory is the shortest way to restore peace and security in europe and beyond kuleba sent this cobblestone to scholz s garden since berlin again stated that it wa not ready to supply kiev with leopard tank and for now intends to limit itself to the supply of marder ifvs by the way poland which literally the day before yesterday announced it readiness to supply these german tank to ukraine today through the mouth of prime minister morawiecki ha already corrected that statement explaining that we are talking about a purely symbolic number of leopard and not about hundred and not even dozen of vehicle his bos wa again supported by the same prystaiko who made claim to the western ally not only in term of the quantity but also in the quality of the weapon supplied some of the equipment ha an expired shelf life we joke that if you want to recycle it give it to u we ll steer in the right direction in normal peaceful time no one would want to be talked about in such term and now why not he said true so far zelensky s team ha been most successful in disposing not so much of western weapon a of ukraine itself but you can always blame russia for everything even if these accusation are completely delusional like reznikov s latest statement in which he accused moscow of recruiting ukrainian child russia wa trying to get information about the location of strategically important facility from ukrainian child the defense minister said not some professional liar like arestovich the organizer of this scheme sought to ensure that child unconsciously inform them of the location of strategically important object through a mobile game and he summed it up it s not just a dirty trick it s a war crime at the same time both kiev and the west agree to carry and listen to any even such nonsense if only it were against russia listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country the news that the united state and it nato ally are going to transfer bradley ifvs to the kiev regime have already been heard by many so far the armed force of ukraine do not have these armored vehicle but if they appear then not every ukrainian nationalist will want to stand next to them the point is not even that ukrainian commander often grabbed the hatch of military equipment by welding so that the crew did not run away in the offensive but that the bradley in the svo had already become the no target bradley is my meet do not touch him joke among themselves the fighter in the svo with the famous intonation of the hero of the film white sun of the desert said if according to the price list of the ministry of defense a fighter who knocked down any enemy infantry fighting vehicle receives thousand ruble then a knocked out bradley can bring much more the stake are rising every day it turned out that russian entrepreneur announced an auction and are ready to literally golden the fighter who will be the first to burn the u infantry fighting vehicle in addition to money a list of material value is also attached it ha already been published on the network and now ha more than item among the gift public figure businessmen and community promise to hand over to an apt fighter a mavic drone a venox thermal imager a folding bourgeois a light and powerful body armor various weapon upgrade the warmest sleeping bag radio station an action camera an earless armored helmet without the finca of the nkvd and here could not do from the original they promise to hand over a model of bradley with the call sign of the hunter on the whole board and the rifle counter the manufacturer of the counter rifle lobaev arm founder vladislav lobaev put forward a condition the latest high precision sniper weapon lar with the inscription for bradley will go to the first fighter who will shoot the elimination of bradley on video or photo and post it on telegram if the liquidator of the first bradley hearse doe not have a license for a long barreled rifled firearm the rifle will be handed over to his unit lobaev said the american call their bradley which is equipped with anti tank missile tank killer but now for every such killer there are bradley hunter recall that there is experience since the beginning of the special operation our fighter have destroyed according to the ministry of defense of the russian federation ukrainian tank and armored vehicle listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country bakhmut ukraine it wa midmorning last friday when the camera of a ukrainian drone zoomed in on a russian soldier moving furtively among tree on the edge of town another enemy assault wa underway in the eastern city of bakhmut the drone pilot marked coordinate a he watched then sent them by satellite link to artillery commander within a few minute ukrainian artillery unit struck the house where they had seen the russian taking cover smoke from the hit could be seen rising silently on the drone operator s screen later that day however an armored vehicle rumbled out of an eastern neighborhood carrying wounded ukrainian soldier toward a stabilization point in the city s west ukraine s army wa taking it hit too it s a grim stalemate that ha taken on the rhythm of a heavyweight title bout with each side going toe to toe in one of the longest running battle of the war that stand in contrast to ukraine s strategy elsewhere along the front line where it succeeded by avoiding direct confrontation relying instead on nimble maneuver deception and western provided long range weapon to force russian retreat in an earlier phase of the war ukraine s leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battle like bakhmut president volodymyr zelensky in a rare moment of public self doubt mulled then whether the death of about ukrainian soldier per day in sievierodonetsk and lysychansk were worth the fight for two already ruined city but this time there ha been no second guessing and new research suggests the lethal urban combat last summer wa not a senseless a it might have seemed at the time an analysis by two leading military analyst published last month by the foreign policy research institute vindicated the attritional fighting the pitched battle weakened the russian army enough for two ukrainian counterattack in the fall to succeed wrote the analyst rob lee and michael kofman those offensive in the kharkiv region in the north and kherson in the south delivered two of the most embarrassing defeat of the war to president vladimir v putin of russia the amount of ammunition russia expended and the casualty they took set up the russian army for failure mr lee said in an interview whether bakhmut wind up playing a similar role ahead of expected spring offensive by ukraine depends on many variable he said including how many soldier russia can field after a mobilization this past fall fierce fighting continued to rage on monday along the front line that extends from bakhmut northeast toward the city of soledar with the russian claiming to have taken a nearby village and ukraine saying that it had repelled russian attempt to storm soledar itself ukraine s deputy defense minister hanna maliar said in a post on telegram that after an unsuccessful attempt to capture soledar and subsequent retreat the enemy regrouped and launched a powerful assault ukrainian force were bravely defending every inch she wrote at the pentagon on monday a senior u s military official described the combat in and around bakhmut a really severe and savage with both side slugging it out bakhmut s strategic value is debatable but it carry symbolic importance for both side for russia capturing it would be the most significant success in month in ukraine the long battle and heavy loss have turned bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance mr zelensky cited the city in a high profile appearance before the u s congress last month and presented house speaker nancy pelosi with a ukrainian flag signed by soldier fighting in bakhmut the imperative to hold bakhmut a ukrainian say nevertheless carry some risk analyst warn saying that it could cloud military judgment and potentially delay a retreat if one becomes necessary viewed from the sky on the monitor of a drone pilot bakhmut slide silently by in sepia hue of brown mud road gray rubble of home and white smoke rising from fire the stalemate ha transformed a swath of ruin and

these unit were essentially throwaway soldier ukrainian soldier have called them human wave assault essentially they take the brunt of whatever ukrainian response there is said the senior american military official speaking on condition of anonymity to discus operational detail then you have better trained force that move behind them to claim the ground that these individual have walked over serhiy hrabsky a former ukrainian colonel and commentator for the ukrainian news medium called the fighting around bakhmut a completely different nature of war ukraine persists in the city s defense he said in part because their loss are important for u the attack on friday wa a case in point the russian were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot with no armored vehicle to be seen by the drone flying overhead on the screen the reading of altitude and range ticked up and down without eye we lose people said the drone pilot who asked to be identified by his nickname navara in keeping with ukrainian military policy and we cannot lose people we have fewer anyway navara asked not to reveal precise location but said it could generally be said of the russian moving into town that the bastard are about meter that way pointing a finger out the broken window of the building not long afterward ukrainian artillery hit the russian a they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one and two story home in the street of the neighborhood a firefight wa picking up and the clatter of machine gun echoed about after a few flight the drone team drove out by another road avoiding the street fighting private andriy pancheko a member of the drone team had been working a an electrician in poland before the invasion but returned and volunteered in the army broadly he said ukrainian were defending their country because if we don t fight we won t have freedom the purpose of holding out specifically in the ruin of eastern bakhmut wa le clear he admitted i don t know

wolfgang kubiki want west germany to give independent tank g ring eckardt said it would be wrong to limit ourselves to marder armoured vehicle we must do and provide everything possible this also applies to leopard tank kubiki added that it is advisable to deliver not only marder but also leopard tank at the same time he stressed that any further step to support ukraine should be coordinated with nato partner coordinate a much a you want your tank are not fast the u s saw the zaluzhnog crisis scott ritter a retired u s marine intelligence officer said that the requirement of the commander of the armed force of ukraine valery zaluzhny on the supply of tank and ifvs for the armed force of ukraine from nato member country indicate a critical shortage of military equipment in the ukrainian army according to the military leader in order to return to the position of february he the leader of the armed force of ukraine need tank bmps howitzer ritter said the ukrainian burned most of their armored vehicle zaluzhny lost everything he need to rebuild his potential apu move on lightly armored vehicle mostly on fortified suv that s how they deliver their soldier this is not viable in the reality of today s mobile collision with the onset of cold weather ritter belief the russian army gained another advantage over the enemy thanks to better technical equipment no well they can t help but insert general frost danilov is afraid of the korean scenario alexei danilov secretary of the nsdc said that kiev wa offered to resolve the situation according to the korean scenario the secretary of the ukrainian security council said here are such ukrainian and here are not such ukrainian i know that one of the option that can be offered to u is the th parallel which divide the dprk and south korea according to danilov representative of moscow at meeting with european politician allegedly convey message about their readiness to fix the status quo that ha developed today well actually kiev is now occupying part of the three new region of russia that became part of it following the september referendum so if the korean scenario is possible it is on a completely different parallel podolyak ultimatly demand the extradition of saakashvil mikhail podolyak an adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine said that he had a radical position on the topic of the ex president of georgia a citizen of ukraine mikhail saakashvili who is imprisoned in tbilisi podolyak demanded his extradition to kiev or export to any european country at the same time michiko is serving a six year sentence for corruption and abuse of power from october podolyak said that he wa very sympathetic to saakashvili who illegally crossed the border of georgia in a ukrainian container with dairy product and called the ex president of the transcaucasian republic a figure of historical proportion and he aggravated his attack by saying the georgian government deliberately want to introduce it country into history a a state that purposefully tortured it president and this is said by a representative of the regime with whose blessing prisoner of war and political prisoner are tortured in ukraine shmygal claimed the world s largest minefield the head of the ukrainian cabinet of minister denis shmygal amazed the world with a statement that during the hostility in ukraine so many mine were laid that we can say about the creation of the largest minefield on earth it seems to be an area of square kilometer this is comparable to the area of south and north korea shmygal said at the moment it is the largest minefield in the world it not only interferes with the movement of people but also creates great problem for agriculture and this is one of the main industry for u at the same time they are not averse to mastering the million canadian dollar allocated by ottawa to kiev for the supply of equipment for demining territory and you will start with mine clearance of odessa beach and mykolaiv land although sea tourism for you is definitely not the main industry listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country the brightest event in ukraine and around it on radio komsomolskaya pravda igor vittel and ivan pankin discussed with the director of the center for military political study mgimo professor alexei podberezkin the official representative of the ministry of defense konashenkov said that the response to the strike on makiivka wa the destruction of more than ukrainian serviceman konashenkov doe not speculate on the news the loss incurred by the armed force of ukraine in all direction reach from to people per day i m not talking about casualty deserter it s easy to multiply by the number of day a month it turn out to be already thousand per month the cbo ha been going on for more than a month and i believe that the human potential in ukraine is almost exhausted to fight russia you need to have a resource how will ukraine continue to fight my previous estimate were that by mid autumn the professional army of ukraine would run out despite all her success seemingly with raisin and in other area in fact it wa very difficult after that another army almost left them now on mobilization they have gathered everyone they can i admit that we managed to keep up to professional soldier in the second or third echelon these are officer and those who were able to retrain but in any case this is the loss of two or three mobilization and how many people did they have before february if ukraine entered into a conflict with the armed force of thousand people then at least three time this value ha been passed there are estimate that speak in favor of a protracted conflict huge loss and even victory of the ukrainian army the ukrainian medium write a lot about this but where is this resource another month well two it may be enough in some operational direction for some offensive it will further exhaust this resource offensive where suppose they threaten to dismember our front in the melitopol direction let s say that it will be possible to concentrate thousand people there and throw them on a breakthrough they will be destroyed in the next hour and then what the resource of man is not infinite a well a the resource of ammunition which is almost exhausted barrel artillery resource the number of shot is limited conditionally there are shot per barrel and then it need to be repaired there is no repair base you can give a forecast about the timing of the special operation that s a tough story i ve been wrong unfortunately a couple of time already i said that the ukrainian army would be practically destroyed in october and so it happened but there wa a second army and in november a third army from where mobilization and nato mercenary and weapon both nato s total arm transfer account for percent let the weapon be different from different state but still these are high precision weapon effective and few expected such a number of mercenary cadre armed formation i think not only of poland but also of romania are already acting a mercenary maybe other state how organized they are this force is quite organized there are mercenary there it is clear that with this number you will not win in general mercenary will not win there is neither interspecific interaction nor the ability to large scale operation but their participation is intensifying in different direction therefore i think that another resource will last a month and a half or two so it turn out until the end of march my prediction is that in two month there will be nothing to fight and there s no one and then then it s a political question on what term to negotiate whether it will be a capitulation or it is a negotiation in fact some kind of compromise or something else in the west they say they can t lose this mean that nato will enter into a confrontation to say is not to do scholz stoltenberg and their ilk have nothing to do with the armed force much le with the planning of military operation they re irresponsible people and they can say whatever they want what conclusion should our leadership draw after the strike on makiivka my personal subjective opinion is a follows we need increased mobilization in all direction including from the point of view of the organization of the armed force not everything is safe there in term of supplying the armed force there are problem in the organisation of the defence industry at the same time fantastic effort are being made in the defense industry i m thrilled with these people who are very little talked about despite all the persecution of the s when of the russian defense industry wa destroyed they were able to do a lot now there is an accelerated process of restoring the capability of the military industrial complex of russia but this recovery did not begin yesterday this trend began to gain strength only in the autumn for real everyone care about the result we do not have the opportunity to stop halfway and agree on some kind of compromise but we cannot compromise with the west we just have to defeat him by force when an armed struggle begin all political argument must be pushed aside they interfere their turn will come when the special operation is over so we have no choice and what is the balance of power between russia and nato we have the opportunity to win there is a wrong attitude to the analysis of the correlation of force when they try to compare gdp military spending and this is simply extrapolated to the military power of the state it s not that no indeed there is time more gdp there if we take the collective west military spending is time greater but that doesn t mean military power is time greater there is no direct relationship well for example the almaz antey concern will produce about one and a half to two time more air defense system this year than the entire collective west and we have objective information about the enemy s weapon when they started a special operation with ukraine according to our estimate they had combat aircraft now we are talking about downed aircraft where did those extra come from they had air defense brigade there only s they got it from the soviet army and how is it that we seem to have already destroyed not but more than a hundred air defense brigade then tell me how many of them are left it is necessary to talk about such thing otherwise doubt arise about the sincerity and accuracy of information when finland and sweden join nato will it affect the security of our country the border will increase by a thousand kilometer in the second world war germany and finland closed our access to the baltic in general there were three or four mining line across the gulf of finland and our baltic fleet wa inactive during the war it could be the same now we wanted to push nato aside but in the end we moved it i met about two year ago with the former head of eu intelligence by the way a finnish rear admiral more than one and a half thousand bilateral and multilateral agreement between the united state and nato have been concluded with finland therefore they were already there in the alliance finland and sweden there are sort of two block one narrow military political bloc with strict obligation is nato and state and about other state are affiliated with this bloc in one way or another this is the collective west we are fighting with them is it true that poland is muddying the water and the rest of nato doe not want a conflict with russia and if kiev s force run out by march warsaw will step in because the west doe not need to stop the conflict the most unpleasant situation may be a prolonged truce there are many frozen conflict in the world there are about state in the world this is not only cyprus transnistria karabakh many drag on for decade and in ukraine there may be one such option but it will not be profitable for u listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country oleg nikolaevich and vladimir solovyov just recalled you in his program that he wa in the zone of a special military operation svo and saw governor oleg kozhemyako there this is another trip of yours now yes before the new year we visited the guy handed them equipment new year s gift tell u how is the mood there because solovyov praised primorye resident for their strong spirit for their courage this among other thing is thanks to the governor and your delegation and you always support your own in the wwo zone you know we have such a character in primorye persistent firm we live in the far east and understand the task that the state face today to combat nazism to eradicate it so that this evil doe not come to our land that s the first thing and the second thing is that there is a complete conviction and understanding that here in the rear people are doing everything possible to help our guy this connection is inseparable it is permanent and of course when you come there to the guy to the svo zone you give gift property equipment which among other thing were made by the hand of primorye resident for the people there it s an additional incentive these are just those news from home that help in battle and our primorye resident never left their position did not leave their position did not leave did not abandon their comrade and also if we talk about the unit that were formed or deployed in our country and now defend the motherland in the svo zone they are among the largest in term of number unit of the pacific fleet with all their guard brigade the airborne brigade the th army aviation and helicopter regiment are primorye soldier who today defend our independence and the right to be and be called russian fighting to ensure that the foot of a nazi never set foot on our land oleg nikolaevich i have known about the equipment that primorye resident supply to the svo zone for a long time but i just understand that this information is not for everyone but maybe it s time to uncover this mystery what exactly do you put there what we do with their own hand is both student and volunteer and if specifically this among other thing spare part for quadcopters someone sews overall warm clothes someone transfer their car yes also to the svo zone probably there is no primorye resident who would be indifferent to what is happening now in the donbas in the kherson region in zaporozhye today everyone to the best of their ability help our fighter but it s also interesting when you return from the front line you meet with the relative of those who fight there well it happens you need to provide some help maybe transfer something a note or something else i gather the wife of military personnel i call someone i tell you how their husband are it s a must and i can t help but ask solovyov told about your guy that many of those who were out of action due to injury or whose contract expired or for example someone is sent on vacation then return to the svo zone again that s about what percentage of contractor and volunteer go back to the special operation zone we have a lot of wounded returning to their unit after recovery there are of course castling that allow our warrior countryman to come out of the front line to put themselves in order a they say to recharge rest and again to the front line you have never met general surovikin no the general is a busy man and due to the fact that he is also constantly on the road it is very difficult to find a time for a meeting and why distract and the final question i guess you literally almost from the first day of the special operation are in the area of it conduct since april yes do you feel that some kind of turning point is coming during a special operation i ve heard critical note from you before too and now what is changing in the svo zone and in our society either way the change is noticeable because there are a lot of family from which men went into the army husband son close relative and everyone understands that now it is impossible to live like this we still have a time of peace and war is somewhere out there far away we are not saying that everyone must necessarily live a front line life but the rear must also work for the svo both ideologically and economically therefore people have such mutual understanding and involvement in everything that is happening in the country and everyone empathizes i believe that our society a a whole understands how important the unity of the nation is now both the russian defence ministry and our industry are beginning to switch to such rail when the situation in term of security change for the better much more need to be done but the work is underway and new weapon and new complex are coming and a second line of defense ha appeared there are opportunity to build fortification that are longer term and more powerful we see that tactic are changing and there is more meaningfulness in our action don t just go ahead go ahead although more and more need to be done both society a a whole and the economy in particular in order to finally turn the tide of the special operation and achieve a peace agreement on our term this is what you are telling me relying among other thing on the opinion of your guy who are fighting in the svo zone of course qualitative change are visible both in the command and control system of troop and in the training of our soldier but there is still a lot of work ahead a lot of thing need to be done thank you very much and good luck in the new year same here listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country alexander mikhailovich we are still trying to closely monitor alexander sapozhnikov the former head of the chita administration who ha been in the combat zone for three week you probably have more information how he is where what can i say how he feel what he is doing now we all have limited information because these are the condition and service and the procedure for conducting a special operation i managed to talk to alexander mikhailovich but very briefly he feel great the mood is good cheerful that s what i want to point out how many time have i met him and his fellow soldier before all the fighter are in a surprisingly calm state they are very restrained thorough it is immediately obvious that their life ha rebooted and there are other life priority and one more thing they are very focused not on themselves not on their comfort maybe on selfishness or on something else they are aimed first of all at achieving victory that s a very good state internally from the point of view of the main military affair everything is in order according to sapozhnikov we do all the task we say we feel absolutely confident well in a good way our hand itch that s his phrase yes he once said that they have such a good hunger for military operation that is to restore justice to punish the ukronazis they have this determination with the equipment with the food he say everything is just very good tell me please what doe sapozhnikov do on the front line he is still a combat paratrooper served year in the army wa wounded alexander again very briefly said that they are where military operation are being conducted but not of an intensive nature but they were already working there in general everything is fine they ve had a few of those case before it s clear what he mean by work there s a whole big division there a i understand it what position sapozhnikov hold i didn t say anything no i m silent about the detail alexander mikhailovich told me that he a a senior warrant officer wa called up and that he wa about to be promoted to the rank of lieutenant epaulette are new or not i didn t ask unfortunately i will get in touch both from our reader radio listener and from me a from a transbaikalian in the past hello to him please convey yes absolutely okay let s wait for good news thank you for that attention to you good luck happily listen a well what to do with the cultural

unaccustomed to human treatment in the pow camp but had forgotten how to smile all serviceman will be delivered for treatment and rehabilitation in medical institution of the ministry of defense of russia all those released require medical and psychological assistance the personnel in the military department commented listen a well what to do with the cultural figure of russia who betrayed our country the head of the investigative committee of the russian federation alexander bastrykin instructed to open a criminal case against actor artur smolyaninov who allowed himself a number of public anti russian statement this is reported by the investigative committee of the russian federation in it telegram channel recall that yesterday smolyaninov in an interview said that if he went to participate in the special operation he would certainly be on the side of the armed force of ukraine he also added that he doe not give a damn about russia even if only the jewish autonomous okrug remains in it and everything else turn into radioactive ash at the same time he mentioned the artist he knew soslan fidarov who allegedly died during a special military operation and said that if he had met him on the battlefield he would have killed him without any doubt but soslan fidarov wa not only alive but also commented with a smile on smolyaninov s speech arthur you imagine i am alive and all the acquaintance who said that i wa dead you were deceived arthur i watched your interview you have a multi million audience they believe you and you deceive them arthur don t do that a for you shooting me on the battlefield arthur we both understand that you will never do that just because you will never be on the battlefield arthur i convey greeting to you from mamay from alexei from nikita from magomed from ahmed from alan from and from all those guy who will not return home arthur it is known that last year smolyaninov wa abandoned by his wife and two child and in the autumn of this year he fled to latvia to avoid mobilization after smolyaninov s statement deputy chairman of the security council dmitry medvedev spoke on the network there on the internet telegram resumed the discussion about how to deal with traitor who switched to the enemy and wanted the death of their fatherland including some insignificant piece of shit who until recently considered themselves to be part of the so called intellectual elite i have recently spoken out on this topic well then there wa a harsh conversation between the bos how to act according to the law or fairly i ll have to clarify of course only by law but if the law doe not work or doe not achieve the goal then according to the special rule of wartime let u recall the experience of the great patriotic war and other country in time of war there have always been such special rule and quiet group of impeccably inconspicuous people effectively performing them of course according to the law so far the state duma ha not adopted wartime law and they have not been signed by the president only according to the constitution and the law andrei klishas chairman of the federation council committee on constitutional legislation and state building replied to medvedev the application for smolyaninov wa eventually submitted to the investigative committee of russia by state duma deputy sultan khamzaev he said that after his statement smolyaninov should repeat the path of blogger alexander nevzorov who wa recognized a a foreign agent and put on trial for discrediting the armed force of russia about the artist smolyaninov the famous film director ivan okhlobystin who often visit the donbas and distinguished himself with his help to it resident and serviceman participating in a special military operation also spoke he said that the artist roman kachanov and alexei panin who fled abroad sneeze him for his conservative view and support for the authority okay rom godson arturchik smolyaninov advises me to go on trial and also doubt my mental health he also escaped now he admires european culture and is wildly sad about the fate of the fatherland he left behind but he wa such a cool boy hard worker romantic i baptize him under the name longinus there wa such a holy warrior a roman centurion who pierced christ with a spear delivered from the torment of the savior very beautiful image i don t dislike them i should but i don t i m really crazy it seems that our artist have become real hostage of their real estate and currency account abroad and this once again suggests that it is necessary to live here

the ceasefire in ukraine ha entered into force the whole truth about it true meaning and the brutal reaction of ukraine military observer viktor baranets explained what russia s ceasefire regime in ukraine mean more medvedev responded to ukraine s refusal to introduce a temporary cessation of fire medvedev said that ukraine rejected the hand of christian mercy refusing to cease fire at christmas more listen also how did change the world economy on the eve of christmas the russian president announced a ceasefire in the cvo zone during the holiday and preparation for it from on january to hour on january the kiev regime responded with fire on the peaceful object of donbas on radio komsomolskaya pravda we talked about this with the expert of the association of military political scientist head of the department of political science and sociology of the russian university of economics andrei koshkin the ceasefire declared by russia in the svo zone in honor of christmas wa the most discussed topic and whether it wa necessary to go for it it wa an important foreign policy decision both in the west and to a certain extent in ukraine reacted ambiguously to it where after all many support the canonical orthodox church this step wa also aimed at ukrainian society but yes the decision is not an easy one and what role it played it wa necessary to show the attitude of russia again to reaffirm that we are open ready to negotiate but taking into account the real condition and not what is offered to u in washington or in kiev we are talking about real agreement that can be discussed in the context of today s event kiev immediately replied that it refused to comply with anything what is the benefit of the offer former secretary of state condoleezza rice and u secretary of defense gate expressed their point of view that time play on russia and although they say that the army of the armed force of ukraine is brilliant but in general when it come to building a geopolitical space and the svo is a point of application of force in a situation of reorganization of the world on a global scale we are talking about the fact that russia offer in the opinion of such analyst important decision in europe including even in the format of cvo what is this about once again on the part of moscow this wa a proposal that wa of a political nature from a military point of view we were answered unilaterally the shelling immediately began at noon on january they hit donetsk this wa zelensky s instruction the president of ukraine did not go to the extent of reacting positively although it had an impact on ukrainian society for u this is an important factor but did it become an information bomb for kiev or for the west what is the collective west doing in the information space russia is blamed for everything it aggressive essence is emphasized and here we unilaterally propose a truce in a christian way which wa painfully perceived by the kiev regime and our step correctly characterizes the russian position in europe and in the world a a whole and the version of just give people silence is accepted by many our patriarch clearly defined why he came up with such a proposal to the supreme commander in chief he recalled that there are many orthodox christian in the combat zone on both side for whom christmas is important so our position is clear but what about the position of the rest of the world any action can be thrown mud in the information space this is an information concept put forward by the collective west together with ukraine yes any suggestion from our side will be perverted but at the same time only a third of the world s population take an aggressive attitude towards russia and two third are tolerant of russia and it action to protect their security the whole world is not reduced to kiev and european state and our western border require a clear definition and we need to protect both our security and our dignity including and such step in that the armed force of ukraine responded with brutal meanness to the ceasefire this is what ukraine ha benefited from from noon on january to on january on the instruction of the russian president and the corresponding order of the minister of defense our troop in the special operation zone observed the ceasefire regime along the entire front line but kiev responded to the humanitarian gesture proposed in honor of orthodox christmas with vile shelling detail listen also how did change the world economy russian serviceman released from ukrainian captivity were delivered to moscow by military transport aircraft of the russian aerospace force this time on january people descended from a military aircraft at the chkalovsky airfield many of them spent month in captivity on the way everyone wa given shoe new uniform and ration the reaction to the gift wa very restrained it wa obvious that people had not only become unaccustomed to human treatment in the pow camp but had forgotten how to smile all serviceman will be delivered for treatment and rehabilitation in medical institution of the ministry of defense of russia all those released require medical and psychological assistance the personnel in the military department commented i spent seven month in a camp for prisoner of war in lviv say one of the released serviceman named vyacheslav even those who have been there for month have remained in the camp it is difficult morally physical exercise are pressurized it is difficult for those who are not accustomed to physical exertion he thanked everyone who participated in the difficult exchange for the new uniform and mobile phone with paid card so that you can keep in touch with loved one alexei also spent several month in captivity his reaction to the first hour of freedom brilliant meeting how they saw our tricolor our land our people breathed our air immediately felt like people the rest would have to be taken from there listen a well how ha changed the global economy since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the decision to conduct the cvo wa made by russian president vladimir putin who motivated the need to start it by protecting the civilian population of the donbas republic from genocide by the militant of the armed force of ukraine the website kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the russian military conducted a retaliatory operation against the armed force of ukraine afu in response to the strike carried out on the point of temporary deployment of serviceman of the armed force of the russian federation in makiivka of the donetsk people s republic dpr information about this wa reported in the russian ministry of defense special service of ukraine have prepared a new large scale anti russian provocation to discredit the armed force armed force of the russian federation in the kharkiv region the russian military department report the russian military inflicted several large scale strike on military and infrastructure facility on the territory of ukraine after the end of the ceasefire regime in force during the christmas celebration kiev refused to comply with this regime lavra is captured perhaps the main news in both russia and ukraine is the seizure of the kiev pechersk lavra now there are schismatics sitting there the ministry of culture of ukraine refused to extend the contract for the use of the lavra to representative of the ukrainian orthodox church of the moscow patriarchate and issued a permit to the pcushniki to conduct service and since the very morning of january the lavra wa surrounded by people in uniform more than three thousand people and journalist not so much but also a lot the temple itself wa transferred almost to martial law total shmon document verification the service wa held for strong guy in camouflage and propagandist and it all ended by itself with nationalist slogan today in ukraine there is nowhere without it there is such a journalistic clich an era is gone many people used it today we disagree the era is gone i stepped aside to return to my rightful place and that will happen very soon the beginning of the revival ru no le it is the capture of almost the main temple of all russian orthodoxy that is called monk of the svyatogorsk lavra one of the three on the territory of ukraine more precisely they called it when the kiev pechersk lavra wa torn out of our hand in one of the program besogon by nikita mikhalkov a prophecy of the monk of the svyatogorsk lavra appeared it say that the reunification of russia will be exactly six month later a soon a heretic and schismatics seize the kiev pechersk and pochayiv lavras the famous director said this prophecy wa passed on back in so if you believe the elder already on july we will see the very reunification of russia persecution of the faith it wa on christmas day that zelensky suspended the citizenship of thirteen priest of the canonical ukrainian orthodox church yes he did not impose sanction but literally took away his passport expelled him from the country among them is metropolitan jonathan of tulchin and bratslav ukrainian medium claim that this decision wa made in the decree of december but they raised it only now according to the current rule in ukraine those mentioned in the decree can be deported from ukraine where not reported and this is on orthodox christmas satanism a it is russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova wrote in her telegram channel and culture it is not only priest who are persecuted and also journalist artist athlete ukrainian a well zelensky also signed a decree on the imposition of sanction against people at once in this list margarita simonyan dmitry kiselyov philip kirkorov nikita mikhalkov mikhail shufutinsky irina allegrova a well a ukrainian midfielder ex captain of the national football team anatoliy tymoshchuk lolita milyavska who also ha a ukrainian passport thus ukraine is the only country in the world that imposes sanction against it own citizen such assistance deserves respect all this mockery of faith and of one s people occurred on christmas day january to hurt harder and in russia this orthodox holiday wa not without word about a special military operation vladimir putin in his address to the russian noted the contribution of the church to the special operation this year wa only the third

harmony in our country take care of those who need help support our soldier participating in a special military operation such a large multifaceted truly selfless work deserves the most sincere

not become enemy battle for the underground goro businessman yevgeny prigozhin told why there are such stubborn and heavy battle for artemovsk bakhmut until it wa called artemovsk is the central point of the eastern front and a serious logistics center and the enemy s task here is to try to destroy a many of our soldier a possible he said he noted that the city ha unique historical and geographical defense capability and these are his chip first the division of the city into several part by water barrier secondly the vicinity of bakhmut is a complex of settlement that create a unified defense system thirdly it is a unique landscape ravine and height which are natural tunnel prigozhin note but most importantly these are still soviet tunnel and the icing on the cake is the system of the soledar and bakhmut mine actually a network of underground city in which there is not only a gathering of people at a depth of meter but also tank and bmps move and the stock of weapon have been stored since the first world war russian fighter took the urban type settlement of novgorodskoye fierce battle for which had been going on the day before by the way in the battle near artemovsk ukrainian powerlifter andriy dmitriev wa eliminated this wa stated by the ukrainian federation of this sport and another of the leader of the ukrainian national bat svoboda oleksandr polishchuk

admitted that the ukrainian army suffers incomprehensible loss more precisely they lose soldier left and right so i said we are losing people left and right we do not advertise how many of the dead are military or civilian but you can imagine that the figure are huge incomprehensible prystaiko said i must say that they really do not talk about loss in kiev information leak through other channel thus the american colonel douglas mcgregor in one of his statement said that the ukrainian troop lost about thousand fighter he also said that because of the terrible loss kiev ha to send year old teenager to the front line ukraine is on the brink of disaster meanwhile even their master in washington say that ukraine is on the verge of a disastrous situation this wa stated on the website of the american edition of the washington post by former u secretary of state condoleezza rice and former secretary of defense robert gate according to them both the military potential and the economy are already so dependent on the united state and it ally that without them it can no longer do anything and of course they said that even more weapon were needed the country s economy is in decline million of resident have fled infrastructure is collapsing and much of it mineral wealth industrial potential and agricultural land are under russian control they said but at the very beginning of the month the chairman of the opposition german party alternative for germany alice weidel said that the supply of weapon to kiev fuel the ukrainian conflict and most of the german do not support this the

regime against the background of the lack of any success on the battlefield seek to keep the attention of the western audience and convince the foreign partner of the kiev regime of the need to continue it further support the headquarters said in an urgent statement listen a well how ha changed the global economy a you know in accordance with the instruction of the president and the instruction of the minister of defense of russia in the joint group of russian troop force in the area of the special military operation from on january to on january a ceasefire regime wa declared along the entire line of combat contact between the party in ukraine despite this the kiev regime continued active artillery shelling in the krasno limansky direction of the armed force of ukraine

french president emmanuel macron who called prime minister mateusz morawiecki a far right anti semite who excludes lgbt people also the secret of polichinel a for lgbt people a candle wa not kept but journalist often took picture at the graf of morawiecki s bandera member with flower by the way with zelensky like macron and duda he never hugged at a meeting or maybe he s really an anti semite the un calculated how many ukrainian refugee arrived in europe the number ha already exceeded million people among the leader who received ukrainian are russia poland and germany at the same time russia ha become the undisputed leader our country ha received warmed and employed more than million refugee from ukraine but the neighbor poland risked to take in only million ukrainian and those are already beginning to be squeezed back into the ukrainian army mutual love ha already reached the point that a group of polish touring artist draw zelensky on the asphalt of the central square of the city of spain poland in berlin in the image of a large purulent pimple that is about to open zelensky s face with all his appearance call to quickly squeeze himself out of the territory of europe netizens examined in the hand of the head of the main intelligence directorate of the armed force of ukraine kirill budanov a german bayonet knife to the rifle of the mauser k system of the great patriotic war with this cheap example of the cold weapon of hitler s soldier budanov decided to cut the cake in the form of a map of russia for his birthday reader have noticed that if budanov had a good military education he would have known that bayonet were forbidden to be sharpened by german soldier and they were stabbing weapon and they also accused him of cheap parody of vladimir zhirinovsky who during his lifetime cut and distributed such a cake in the form of ukraine dmitry medvedev commented on the refusal of the kiev regime to join the christmas truce in his telegram channel ukrainian were extended the hand of christian mercy for the great holiday their leader rejected it i think most of our serviceman taking part in the svo calmly exhaled when they heard the refusal of the main ukrainian clown to cease fire on christmas day le problem and disingenuousness without accurate comparison too could not do those who did not allow orthodox ukrainian to go to

supply with western weapon since the beginning of the ceasefire the armed force of ukraine have fired more than shell at the settlement of donbas and other liberated territory a representative of the cabinet of minister of germany said that the promise of new arm supply to ukraine are not connected with the day of silence declared by vladimir putin on the contact line the telegram channel of the main intelligence directorate of the armed force of ukraine showed footage of armed mercenary running around the shed of bakhmut whom he call member of the international legion of the main

bakhmut the telegram channel of the armed force of ukraine said in a statement these shot are just a real gift to the fighter of the chechen republic who have blood account with this terrorist abdulkhakim he is also a native of the chechen republic rustam magomedovich azhiyev or ruslan magomedovich azhiyev ha been on the international wanted list of terrorist and extremist for about year i recall the word of russian president vladimir putin who in said in syria our armed force are fighting first of all for russia defending the security of our citizen we must meet them and destroy them on the distant approach azhiyev is well known to our special service and his fate is typical for all mercenary first from to he killed civilian and russian serviceman in non existent ichkeria under the command of international terrorist rustam basayev basayev liked to be treated in ukraine until he wa shot in aliyev became a lieutenant in in a battle with our special force he injured his eye and shot three finger on his left hand the bandit fled through the gorge to turkey where he licked his wound until after that he went to syria where he joined the rank of international terrorist under the nickname abdulhakim shishani in syria ajiev s detachment declared it jamaat in the area of latakia and idlib the bandit were engaged in kidnapping racketeering murder and sabotage but in russian troop pushed azhiyev out of syria for turkey where he continued the terror he managed to commit several armed attack on his countryman with their family in october there wa information that azhiyev appeared in ukraine where he wa offered to command the same bandit and terrorist for good money in general by the age of azhiyev can only boast of the rank of colonel of the armed force of ichkeria in general such a typical colonel terrorist of a number of non existent state by the way azhiyev ha in poland a younger brother athlete anzor who is engaged in mma aziyev himself wa also engaged in sport since childhood before leaving with the bandit in the forest at the russian championship in freestyle wrestling he took th place it remains to wish anzor good luck in polish mma and the returned rustam to rest on russian soil sloviansk ukraine an array of mostly unremarkable item stretched across two wooden table on the far side of a cramped workshop in eastern ukraine double sided tape glove allen wrench a soldering iron d printed plastic ball bearing a digital scale next to them wa a german dm fragmentation grenade they were all important ingredient for ukrainian troop trying to piece together a puzzle how do you create a grenade that weighs next to nothing but can be dropped from a drone and destroy a roughly ton russian tank war is an economy it s money said graf a stout bearded ukrainian soldier in charge of his unit s drone team and if you have a drone for and a grenade for and you destroy a tank that cost million it s very interesting since russia launched a full scale invasion of ukraine nearly a year ago technological advancement on the battlefield have mostly centered on both country increased use of small remotely operated drone and their growing importance in almost every aspect of the war including reconnaissance correcting artillery fire and so called kamikaze attack now graf and his team who have become expert at killing russian troop with munition dropped from the air are trying to raise the drone effectiveness to the next level by using them to deliver what they consider the perfect grenade the challenge is building that grenade it s our main goal graf said last month from his headquarters in the city of sloviansk he wa surrounded by the various component needed to turn a flying toy into a lethal battlefield tool like other ukrainian soldier during the war he identified himself to reporter only by his military call sign the tinkering in graf s workroom is another example of how ukraine s military ha adapted a the war progress creating advantage in the face of the russian army s superiority in troop number and long range weaponry the grenade graf said should weigh around pound the maximum weight a dji mavic drone can carry without it flight being significantly disrupted to get the grenade closer to the desired weight his team ha been using a d printer to try to make a lightweight casing that can hold the explosive needed to penetrate a tank s armor the painstaking task involves experimenting with grenade of differing design clasped in a vise in their workroom and operating around the explosive mechanism to fine tune them the grenade should be able to penetrate the hull of an armored personnel carrier or tank something not currently possible with a munition weighing around a pound graf said for now their best grenade is the german supplied dm an explosive that with stabilizing fin attached weighs near their imposed threshold but the dm is manufactured to kill people and is not effective against a tank every day we study we make some experiment with grenade with bomb with drone and make our work better graf added to graf and the legion of ukrainian drone operator and armorer the quest for an enhanced grenade is part of a broader drone arm race with russia like graf s team the russian military is also trying to make it small unmanned vehicle deadlier to varying level of success the chinese made mavic drone ha turned into the ubiquitous backbone of ukraine s drone force it is small portable ha a decent battery life and range and can quickly be outfitted to drop grenade russian force use it too the russian bigger military drone like the self exploding shahed which is made in iran and frequently launched at ukraine s infrastructure are used differently from the small mavics that are deployed against concentration of troop and trench the mavics are quadcopters they can hover like a helicopter directly over their target before dropping their lethal cargo ukraine ha stayed ahead in the drone arm race in much the same way a it ha succeeded on the battlefield lower level commander have more leeway in how and when to use them and drone unit like graf s have le bureaucracy to navigate to test and deploy their weapon the ukrainian drone effort is more streamlined and work directly with the military said samuel bendett a specialist on russian drone and other weapon at cna a research and analysis organization in arlington va the russian are only getting there now that mean that graf and his comrade invention can quickly be shared with other drone unit in chat group before being used in the field with little oversight russia mr bendett said ha taken a more industrial approach to the drone arm race preferring munition that are mass produced though some russian volunteer group are making progress in testing and sending drone to the front line the only drawback for the russian navigating moscow s soviet era bureaucracy to get the right equipment into their soldier hand mr bendett said there s a lot of this back and forth he said one side ha a tech breakthrough and the other side catch up tucked away on one of the shelf in graf s workshop wa evidence of moscow s industrialized attempt to compete with kyiv a factory produced russian ofsp a small roughly millimeter grenade meant to be dropped by an orlan a reconnaissance drone that sound like a lawn mower the grenade had a manufacture date of march stenciled onto it side they are just dropping a default modification of this grenade said iliya one of graf s drone engineer and armorer we are dropping everything that we can find the main thing to consider he said is the weight of a grenade that the drone can move another obstacle that ukrainian drone operator face is having to modify the weapon to work in way that they were not originally built to the challenge are twofold inundated with munition from country like france germany and the united state ukrainian troop need to learn the intricacy of each device before jerry rigging the explosive that process is complicated too some small grenade like the m which is made and supplied by the united state and is sometimes called the golden egg because of it size shape and color have the kind of shaped charge warhead that can punch through armor plate but they are meant to be fired only from hand held grenade launcher and not dropped by drone so ukrainian soldier must carefully place the grenade into a vise grip pry off the cartridge case that contains the propellant used to fire it and then begin the even more delicate work of teasing off the aluminum cup over the grenade s nose with plier and other hand tool the soldier must gently probe and manipulate the fuze s inner mechanism to disable both of it safety feature if successful they are left with a grenade that could easily explode if mishandled and before it can be sent on a mission against russian troop the explosive ha to be carefully mounted onto the drone graf said that no one on his team had been killed while working on the grenade but that the process wa perilous for troop on the front line there are many many dead guy because they don t understand how these thing work he said despite the risk graf and his team continue to tinker in their workshop teeming with different kind of explosive edging ever closer to the elusive tank killing grenade currently they have a munition that they say can penetrate russian armor but it is around a half pound too heavy we make grenade from the trash joked graf but if you can destroy a tank from a mavic you re the best at this war dossier kp political scientist rostislav ishchenko wa born in kyiv in kiev he graduated from school and the tara shevchenko university he worked in the ministry of foreign affair in the administration of the president of ukraine he represented ukraine at the negotiation in the osce a well a during the visit of delegation to different country he wa an adviser to the deputy prime minister of ukraine and an adviser to the minister of education and science since after the change of power in kiev he left became a citizen of russia they run and return rostislav vladimirovich you know perfectly well the people who stayed in ukraine what can you say about them obviously they have completely different mood there are those who remained and they were killed by patriot of ukraine and there are those who died at the front fighting with russia there are those who stayed and wait for russian troop to come and even say you would shoot more god with him but let the russian troop come faster their attitude of course is different but the main thing is that it is constantly changing according to the latest official data million people lived in ukraine it s january no one know the exact figure the only thing that can be said with certainty is that there were hardly more than million in europe and in russia several million people lived and worked permanently at the same time ukraine continued to consider them it citizen those who had already essentially left ukrainian citizenship and they left with the start of the special operation according to official data alone there are over million of them in the first day and then million of them came back there were other wave of emigration and to europe and how many left unofficially year old did not know any other state what s with the mood of those who still stayed if we talk about the trend then unfortunately the deterioration of the attitude towards russia is monitored this vector wa set before the collapse of the ussr in and continues now and the further it go the stronger it intensifies and it s not just because of the special operation those who are now year old they did not know another state and that s up to half the population and maybe more yes the elder have always been more positive about russia somewhere until the end of the s the desire to restore a single state generally dominated and then the older generation began to blur along with this the nationalist tendency began to grow it wa even before the collapse of the ussr and those who are loyal to u come to u i won t say that everyone here is like that i have repeatedly met people who say that they support ukraine or say i do not care at all who win there but at the same time they chose russia for their place of residence not europe at the same time there are relatively few radically minded people in ukraine who are really ready to kill percent and everyone else is who the bulk are those who do not like russia moderately largely due to ukrainian propaganda but they are also dissatisfied with the ukrainian regime because tiger in a meat cage are not reported and when russia come they also say humanitarian aid is not like that salary are not the same etc you will have to become russian doe it make sense to talk to them to drag them over to yourself or they re going to be that ticking time bomb there is a need obviously over time hostility will continue the number of territory that were ukrainian and became russian will increase and the population in these territory will have to be re forged how from my point of view the only effective method is to work according to the same principle by which ukrainian nationalist worked with post soviet generation they spat on those who grew up under the soviet union and began to work with generation of schoolchildren from the fourth or fifth grade and these next generation growing up became their base and they simply neutralized the older generation they gradually abolished the russian language first seized and then forged the russian medium european ukrainian who went abroad treat russia there are people who simply left the war there are people who left russia of course with the beginning of the special operation emigration which wa firmly opposed to russia greatly increased this is a politically active emigration there are not so many of them they just did not catch the eye before most of the emigration just sits and frankly they do not care deeply about what is happening there in ukraine they are trying to integrate into society they just left for a better future that is they plan to stay of course this trend ha been going on since then the number of ukrainian who transport family increased dramatically earlier only a young man or a man came and constantly went back and forth now these people want to become pole swede portuguese etc to form an ordinary russian naro only during the special operation according to official data million thousand people came to russia a huge number plus another or million ukrainian were also officially here what do these people have hope for how they feel about russia it is important to remember that ukrainian did not appear in russia yesterday or last february emigration began almost immediately in the s somewhere by about million people had moved they are already russian think so it wa purely economic migration ukraine could not physically feed it population and people went to russia cross border tie were quite active somewhere in the early noughties there wa a moment when ukraine suddenly recorded almost transport paralysis in the border regional center driver of trolleybus bus tram left for russia because here they paid more this is just one example and there are many such example in addition even before putin s statement on the need for import substitution entire strategic enterprise were bought and transported from ukraine to russia with documentation with equipment with people after active political migration began compared to the economic one it is very small but it is there will we be able to come to an agreement with the ukrainian and live in peace and harmony once the bolshevik claimed that there were no fortress that they could not take if we set ourselves such a task and approach the matter without slogan but pragmatically then we will not negotiate we need to develop the territory in such a way a it is simply beneficial to russia that is from the local population to form a normal ordinary russian people thank god they speak russian half have russian surname the other half are also russian only south russian which for some reason they consider ukrainian to explain to new generation that they are actually russian i don t think it s a super difficult task we just need to work slowly hard and consistently on this listen a well how ha changed the global economy on january patriarch kirill of moscow and all russia called for the establishment of a christmas truce in ukraine and donbas so that orthodox people can attend service on christmas eve and on the day of the nativity of christ russian president vladimir putin after the call of the patriarch instructed russian defense minister sergei shoigu to introduce from on january to on january a ceasefire along the entire line of combat contact between the party in ukraine at the same time the russian side appealed to ukraine with an appeal to declare a ceasefire in a similar way and give believer the opportunity to attend service in church on christmas eve a well a on the day of the nativity of christ the appeal say proceeding from the fact that a large number of citizen professing orthodoxy live in the area of hostility we call on the ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire the minister of defense of the russian federation issued an order according to which all our troop on the line of combat contact are obliged to cover the gun at the time designated by the supreme commander in chief the order wa received at the headquarters of the commander of the special military operation army general sergei surovikin and communicated to the personnel this is a form of temporary suspension or cessation of hostility in a certain area and at a certain time if the conflicting party comply with such condition then at the designated time hostility cease the selection of the wounded the exchange of prisoner and killed etc violation of the term of the ceasefire is considered a a violation of the law and custom of war yes there were during world war i on december an unofficial ceasefire wa declared on the western front a france britain and germany celebrated christmas this lasted for the week leading up to christmas british and german troop exchanged greeting and song while sitting in the trench german soldier lit christmas tree there wa a ceasefire and separation of force agreement during the settlement of the georgian abkhaz conflict in may many have already forgotten for sure that even during the beginning of the armed conflict in the donbas when kiev began hostility against the dpr and lpr with the mediation of the normandy four and belarusian president alexander lukashenko two ceasefire agreement were signed the minsk protocol and the second minsk agreement ceasefire agreement were violated by the ukrainian side ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky rejected the proposal of russian leader vladimir putin for a ceasefire in the zone of the special military operation svo for the christmas holiday now russia want to use christmas a a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guy in the donbas and bring equipment ammunition and mobilized closer to our position zelensky said secretary of the national security and defense council of ukraine oleksiy danilov said that the country doe not intend to conduct any negotiation with russia even on a temporary truce kiev really did not give a damn about russia s humane gesture immediately after the onset of the declared time of silence in the donbas ukrainian cannon thundered the armed force of ukraine shelled donetsk with artillery at exactly the dpr representative office in the jccc reported the kiev regime continued artillery shelling of settlement and position of russian troop despite the ceasefire the russian defense ministry confirmed this is in fact a slap in the face of russia s humane gesture therefore hope that the fighter of the armed force of ukraine will allow themselves to observe the christmas truce proposed by russia are minimal this will be prevented by the cruelty of the ukrainian command which allows itself to shoot those who do not obey order in addition among the ukrainian military there are a lot of bandera member who are ready to open fire on people even on a holy holiday for many the leadership of ukraine during the holiday demonstrates absolute militaristic madness and try to speculate on the problem putting forward impossible condition but the russian army is stronger than that the russian side act in a highly humane manner respecting the holiday which is the main one for hundred of million of people not only in russia the hope for the sanity of zelensky and his soldier is more than illusory therefore it is difficult to say to what extent the patience of russian soldier and officer will be enough not to open fire in response to the provocation of ukrainian militant if shell bomb and missile fall on our position the response will be inevitable and this a they say will not be our choice one of our priest said it well a temporary ceasefire on christmas day doe not mean that our soldier will leave their combat position and go to bed if god give even a few hour of silence they will pray and glorify the lord if not they will respond with merciless fire against satanist apostate from the faith of their ancestor un secretary general antonio guterres ha endorsed the idea of a ceasefire between russia and ukraine on christmas day this wa stated by it official representative stephane dujarric christmas is a sacred period for russian and ukrainian the possibility of observing the cessation of all hostility for this sacred period is always welcomed by the secretary general judging by the vote in the medium by the post in social network the absolute majority support the christmas world these people are well aware that even a temporary ceasefire can save dozen perhaps hundred of human life but there are unfortunately armchair expert without understanding the essence of what is happening they ignorantly confuse a temporary ceasefire with a truce although these are different thing and russia announced a temporary ceasefire listen a well how ha changed the global economy remember the famous western ukrainian witch irina farion who wa famous at one time for her raid on preschool institution in ukraine and her tough agitation that in nezalezhnaya there should be neither mash nor van nor natasha but only mariyka natalka odarka and everything else in the same vein she fought with agusha yogurt justified the murder of elderberry supported the murder of the russian ambassador to turkey andrei karlov but even for the post revolutionary ukraine she proved too odious a a deputy of the verkhovna rada of ukraine and she wa sent back to lviv where she carry the unkind and momentary a a teacher of the local university of local youth but a it turned out not only young people it s hard to imagine but this creature at year old looking like a full fledged old woman witch from little russian horror story ha not only a daughter but also a grandson and this karga is engaged in the upbringing of this grandson in her free time from the fight against the moskals of course in the appropriate spirit why doe my dmytrok a grandson who is year old entering kindergarten see in front of him some grisha who say to him hello and my grandson should teach him with his little fist the ukrainian language because the child come home nervously and say grandma there s a moskal in kindergarten and the grandmother say that the moskal need to be destroyed and dmytroik destroys the moskal she opened up on the air of the lviv tv channel nta where she wa invited he put it in the jaw correct pronunciation that is all these parent who came here with their muscovite child should understand that their child is not a child that this is a child who should speak in a kindergarten if it is a state or private kindergarten should speak the state language so that my child doe not gain flea of the moscow language a child is not a child let him say hello but he doe it not in the right language but in the moskvoroto language such a child must be destroyed the essence of farion s revelation which she is proud of which she voice publicly and this is the quintessence of today s ukrainianism because thousand ten of thousand of such crazy witch brought up and continue to educate their grandchild and granddaughter before passing them on to ideologically verified and correct nazi instructor from the camp of the azov banned in russia and similar terrorist organization farion doe not shy away from scandal so she feel no le proud of the fact that she prevented a customer in one of the lviv store from buying a cake because she apparently an elderly intelligent woman asked to sell her a cake in russian language you can send in the direction of the ship immediately if you hear the moscow word this if we talk about everyday life and we all go to the shop i wa buying tea today and watched a a lady if you can call it a lady with a stick came into the same store and said hello this is in the city of lviv and i realized that this liberator came they haven t fully exhaled here yet she shared another of her peremogs and so it came in and asked for a cake she want a cake my sacred duty wa to spoil her appetite and mood and to send this old turnip which i brought here to lviv putin i stripped this granny liberator of that piece of cake today i hope she wa shaking for a very long time after what i told her no one insulted her did not encroach on her any right it wa she who pounced like a beast prowling and growling at an ordinary grandmother it is possible that she is god s dandelion and she is proud of the victory over those who cannot respond to her rudeness and misanthropy over old woman and kid by the way she ended her passage about russian speaker no le cynically a well a what she said up to that moment if you don t like it what s the problem i sat on a tank with the letter z and with the letter v with my fetus and disappeared from here she concluded her story how dmytro humiliates and destroys grisha if she had the will she would have shot all russian speaker and baby would have begun to teach russophobia in infancy it is surprising that in the civilized west these speech are pointedly overlooked however why be surprised if europe is an ally of ukraine whose official authority are doing what farion say only without further ado but this freak a former member of the cpsu whose is written on her face in arshin letter is a little unaware that tank with the letter z and v a well a with the letter o have not yet reached lviv where she teach ukrainian kid to kill moskal and when they get there what will happen in the meantime it will not be grisha who will leave lviv but the old woman farion herself will tear from there so that only her heel will sparkle true this most famous fan and fan of stepan bandera is unlikely to receive a warm welcome in poland and therefore her path lie much further for example in chicago where her sister martha work in the mayor s office according to some report however for the latest revelation to irina farion we can only say thank you it once again convincingly and vividly showed what ukraine ha become under the current government and why this country simply need denazification from small to large russia is not at war with the people or with the people because we are confronted by non human listen a well how ha changed the global economy since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in

naked to the waist for minute her interrogator leveled obscenity at her then threw a jacket over her and let seven other men into the room it wa to frighten she remembered i did not know what would come next sitting in olha s cramped kitchen week later in kherson in southern ukraine anna sosonska an investigator with the prosecutor general s office listened to her recount the ordeal an account of forced nudity that prosecutor say added to an accumulation of evidence that russian force had used sexual crime a a weapon of war in the place they once ruled we are finding this problem of sexual violence in every place that russia occupied said m sosonska every place kyiv region chernihiv region kharkiv region donetsk region and also here in kherson region after month of bureaucratic and political delay ukrainian official are gathering pace in documenting sexual crime which are prevalent and devastating in time of war but often remain hidden under layer of shame stigma and fear we found all type of case of war crime rape forced nudity sexual torture inflicted on men woman and child m sosonska said a pattern to the crime is emerging she added now we see there is a line of war crime in the russian army and among russian commander russian official have repeatedly denied accusation of human right abuse despite widespread evidence and account collected by ukrainian and international investigator a spokeswoman for russia s foreign ministry maria zakharova recently dismissed a report by the u n human right commission a unsubstantiated testimony and no more than rumor and gossip after investigating some area russia retreated from an independent international commission reported to the united nation in october that an array of war crime committed in ukraine included case of sexual violence against woman and girl victim ranged from older than to a young a a year old girl forced to perform oral sex on a soldier which is rape the report said it detailed more than a dozen case involving gang rape family member forced to watch a relative being sexually assaulted and sexual violence against detainee iryna didenko who lead the prosecutor s department investigating such crime ha already opened case of conflict related sexual violence the real number she said is much much more in one formerly occupied village in the kyiv region psychologist found one in nine woman had experienced sexual violence she said hundred of people suffered sexual violence and torture in russian detention she added the trauma is raw and inhibiting viktoriya a year old woman in the kyiv region shake when she describes how in early march russian soldier shot dead her neighbor and then hauled her and her neighbor s wife off to be raped the fear still remains she said sometimes when the electricity is out i am seized by fear and i feel they could come back viktoriya wa one of the few survivor willing to talk publicly she asked that only her first name be used and that her face not be photographed a did several other woman for fear of reprisal by russian force but the stigma and judgment of neighbor and acquaintance were also an abiding pain she said they are gossiping about me and i mostly stay at home she said the grief wa such that her neighbor nataliia who wa also raped and whose husband wa killed wa given refuge abroad her year old son wa suicidal in the week after the attack said m didenko a psychologist and lawyer m didenko met nataliia when she visited their village after russian troop withdrew before the war her department had handled domestic violence crime and she knew well the difficulty woman faced in reporting crime she said much of that ha to do with the stigma of rape in a conservative religious society but there is also a deep seated distrust of the authority in a post soviet system that ha rarely focused on victim need and often blamed them instead from our experience with domestic violence we realized victim do not talk about it in principle m didenko said it is even harder in a war when they could be accused of fraternizing with the enemy she said no one will come running to apply to u she said that s why we decided that we have to go to them the need to help ukraine s survivor of sexual violence is immense activist say the nation s few woman s shelter have started taking in war victim aid organization such a woman for woman international and the andreev foundation started providing mobile gynecological clinic and counseling session of more than woman and girl that the foundation ha counseled since the invasion began have acknowledged experiencing sexual violence in the war eight were younger than some survivor have expressed suicidal thought said anna orel an assistant project manager at the foundation one girl said that she wanted to cut off her own skin she said she could not bear the smell of men s perfume others were scared of military uniform even of ukrainian soldier and of men in general many of them don t want to continue to live m orel said it s very very important for some professional person to hold their hand and to go through this with them from the account of those who have come forward there is evidence that russian commander knew about rape or even encouraged it official said wayne jordash a british lawyer advising ukrainian prosecutor said he had seen sign of acquiescence by commander among case he had reviewed m didenko said there wa a clear pattern of behavior when russian troop seized an area ground force arrive and rape start on the second or third day witness reported commander ordering rape or giving instruction that suggested they condoned it like telling soldier to find some relaxation in one case m didenko described a commander told his men ok go a he waited outside a house one soldier wa heard saying we ll just beat her about one woman and this one we ll rape in another case eight russian soldier raped and assaulted a man who wa stopped at a checkpoint these are not single case m didenko said there is an even clearer pattern she said of organized sexual abuse in the detention facility run by russian troop police officer and security force

the similarity of the evidence and account across city describing torture method interrogation and officer from russia s main intelligence agency the f s b ha convinced ukrainian prosecutor that abuse can be traced to the russian leadership it cannot be that a soldier did this without an order m didenko said the f s b came efficiently knowing their job tortured everyone on the genitals she said it s surely a system many ukrainian and their supporter say they believe russia aim to crush ukraine s spirit of resistance and destroy it society it s part of a genocide m didenko said but for u to prove it we need time the prolonged and bloody battle for bakhmut ha destroyed more than half of the city in eastern ukraine a local official said on thursday pavlo kyrylenko the head of the ukrainian

circumstance of the attack of the region under constant fire is tokmak a city in the zaporozhye region located a few dozen kilometer from the line of contact there are flight to vasilyevka there wa a shelling of prishib mikhaylovka in general about settlement that are hit by heavy artillery mlrs trying to use attack drone and other moment rogov said rogov noted that the target of the shelling are lined up in a certain chain in connection with which additional security measure are being introduced and not only in the zaporizhzhya region but also in other new territory of the russian federation to the question of the presenter about the incident in melitopol and vasilyevka and specifically the commandant s office in the latter rogov replied that there were injured and dead if we talk about melitopol then according to preliminary data yes it wa air defense so far no information ha appeared about the victim or about the destruction that is after those inspection so there is a hope that everything worked out thank god say a member of the council of the regional administration about the event in melitopol a for vasilyevka there wa apparently a criminal plan because first a blow wa struck and when the ministry of emergency situation officer arrived to rake up the rubble and save people at that time a second blow wa inflicted rogov clarified the situation about the commandant s office in vasilyevka regarding the situation at the zaporizhzhya npp znpp he described it a stably tense according to him work is underway to restart the station to increase the level of it safety and

an uninterrupted supply of energy to the nuclear power plant so that it operates in cold and hot stop mode rogov explained noting the importance of the znpp for providing energodar a well a protecting the dome with radioactive waste in addition rogov noted the discussion around the transfer of the znpp zone to ukraine and the statement of it president volodymyr zelensky about forceful interference in the transition procedure which in his opinion are disingenuous in nature and do not guarantee the safety of the station russia clearly voiced the proposal that were that is the cessation of shelling the non landing of paratrooper zelensky s militant to seize the nuclear power plant and the protection of nuclear power plant by people with small arm and the lack of heavy equipment at the nuclear power plant strictly speaking russia ha already fulfilled the last two point without any international memorandum and other thing rogov concluded moscow appeared to blame it own troop wednesday for the deadly strike that hit it military barrack just after midnight on new year s day saying banned cellphone use alerted ukrainian force to the barrack s location the deadliest known assault on russian force since the war began occurred at a m on new year s day in the city of makiyivka in the hard fought donetsk region the wall street journal reported that the regiment s deputy commander wa also killed in the strike caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news my neighbor in the compartment yuri is an obzh teacher in one of the school in simferopol with the beginning of the svo he enlisted in the rank of volunteer he evacuated the resident of kherson took the humanitarian to the front do you know what is the most useless of all humanitarian aid he asks i shrug my shoulder in response cereal in package say yuri you bring kilogram and the fighter throw up their hand how do we cook them soldier do not always have the opportunity to cook themselves a hot meal obviously that is why dry borscht from masha s mother such a nickname stuck to the year old crimean woman maria varlamova for a long time became a real salvation i poured a set of sachet into a cup poured boiling water after minute the real rich soup is ready with vegetable meat almost like at home her friend say that caring is her middle name she wa born in a small town near kharkov in her youth she moved to krivoy rog opened her own tailoring studio there there she also took under the wing of young student cutter who called her mother and after year she moved to the crimea where she ha been living for year her only son grew up and studied here and a grandson wa born maria designer costume designer in the season she worked a a cook in sanatorium recently she ha become seriously interested in psychology and astrology now he conduct training for those who wish that s what he doe for a living with the beginning of the special operation masha s mother became a volunteer i found list in volunteer group and bought what i could bandage cotton wool medicine food and in early october she came up with the idea why not send soup to the front a dry ration the idea of dry soup wa born at archaeological excavation in such expedition maria worked a a cook for year the condition were extreme a huge plateau without a single tree under the scorching sun she say i had to twist to store the same vegetable for a long a possible in the sun carrot and beet were dried and at home i made blank in advance in dryer housewife have long been popular with special dryer in which you can dry vegetable fruit mushroom for the winter in scientific parlance this is called dehydration complete removal of moisture and dried ingredient are called sublimate for two month now dozen of people have been participating in the project borscht soup and porridge to the front from masha s mother throughout russia mostly woman they call themselves dryer because their main task is to dry the ingredient for borscht and package them in bag dry soup borscht and cereal are product that are completely ready for consumption packaged in small vacuum bag the menu of masha s mother is diverse borscht with meat lean borscht with mushroom and bean buckwheat soup with mushroom pea soup with smoked meat something can simply be poured with boiling water something to cook in a cauldron pour the content into boiling water and boil for minute you have already understood that any vegetable spice and meat undergo pre drying in dehydrators and are mixed depending on the recipe in different proportion in the process of drying vegetable lose percent of their mass due to moisture now i have kg of carrot and beet in three dryer at home say maria of all this goodness kg of dry product will remain sponsored volunteer bring maria home farm vegetable in bag on average kilogram of carrot beet etc then other participant of the project come to maria in total dryer participate in it they disassemble vegetable at home and there they thoroughly wash peel grate on a large grater someone with their hand someone on food processor however before the borscht get into the bag in dry form it go a long way everything for borsch and other soup is heat treated and then dried but it all depends on the specific product see recipe of masha s mother when the sublimate is dried and accumulated enough maria and her assistant pack it in bag the volume are different but the calculation of one serving is approximately a follows tablespoon of potato tablespoon of carrot slightly le than dried onion tablespoon of cabbage tablespoon of beet teaspoon of tomato powder dry tomato then grind them with a blender the shelf life of such a soup in a vacuum package is about six month but provided that everything is dried to a crunch in just two month more than serving were sent to the front line the demand for dry soup and cereal wa great order come from everywhere but the possibility of the crimean factory borshchevichka a the project wa nicknamed in the network are not unlimited the cooking time of serving is about a day from to hour additional cost water and electricity mary receives decent bill for november for example they counted thousand for electricity and thousand ruble for water a a result the cost of one portion of borsch taking into account electricity water and the cost of vegetable and meat is ruble the rest of the soup come out a little cheaper for industrial production you need a room with a good hood so that moisture from vegetable doe not settle on the ceiling and wall during drying secondly good equipment not household dryer but the volunteer initiative ha every chance to turn into a business that promise a good profit with a competent calculation p s i asked maria varlamova for one bag of borscht meat to try on a business trip to the hotel for dinner this is what you need i poured boiling water in a plate let it brew for minute during this time a borscht aroma spilled throughout the room looking like an ordinary homemade borscht it taste like it too and most importantly this is a piece of real home warmth and comfort how to properly dry vegetable and meat carrot and beet these vegetable are laid out on a greased pan or saucepan with vegetable oil and simmered for minute over low heat when the vegetable are cooled they are placed in dryer maria ha two industrial dryer at home one wa given to her in an indefinite lease the second wa bought with the money collected by volunteer in them vegetable lie for hour in household appliance the process stretch up to hour the result is a sweet spicy sublimate cabbage cabbage is cut quite coarsely by hand strip about a centimeter shredding is too fine then the cabbage is sprinkled with salt a little everything is gently mixed after that you need to put the cabbage in the microwave for to minute it can give juice put it in a colander to make the glass moisture after in the dryer for hour potato potato need to be grated or cut into straw if the soup need to be cooked in a cauldron and then boiled in boiling water until ready salt then rinse with cold water and put in dryer for to hour meat the first spos the most delicious is smoked dried meat for pea soup first it is kept for to day in a special marinade water with sugar salt and spice then they cut into piece and smoke for hour when the meat cool it is cut into cube and placed in dryer for to hour the second spos low fat pork beef chicken or turkey is twisted in a meat grinder with a large net then fry in a frying pan with oil and spice until ready for minute salt at the last moment after another minute of roasting pour into a bowl in a thin layer cool and send to dry it is necessary to dry to the state of sawdust when poured with boiling water dried lump swell and give the aroma of meat the third spos pork carbonate must be cleaned of film and fat boil for minute pull it out dry it wrap in foil and bake for hour in the oven then completely cool unwind the foil remove the fat which accumulates a jelly cut into piece cm wide disassemble into fiber and send to drying this type of meat perfectly soak sweat in boiling water listen a well how ha changed the global economy the russian military who came under fire from the artillery of the armed force of ukraine in makiivka in the first minute of the year showed real heroism and courage this wa announced in his telegram channel by the acting head of the dpr denis pushilin based on the information that i have i can say with confidence that there were many manifestation of courage and real heroism among the guy from this regiment pushilin wrote most of them having barely got out of the building damaged by the american highrs slightly recovered and returned back to get their comrade out then when the employee of the ministry of emergency situation arrived they also helped them to save the others they helped risking their life some of the dead are those who died when they returned to save their fellow soldier according to pushilin the officer of the regiment proved themselves more than worthy some by the way are also from among the mobilized they risked themselves by pulling out soldier unfortunately among them there are also wounded and dead the deputy commander of the regiment ala wa killed the acting head of the dpr noted that all those who needed were provided with the necessary medical care first on the territory of the republic then in other region of russia during the strike on the temporary deployment point of one of the military unit in makiivka soldier were killed according to the deputy head of the main military political directorate of the ministry of defense sergei sevryukov this happened on january a minute after the onset of the new year the armed force of ukraine fired six shell from the himars mlrs two air defense missile were shot down but four more hit the building where the serviceman were staying the ceiling collapsed in the room many died under the rubble by theme what really happened in makiivka the first conclusion from the tragedy with the russian mobilized colonel baranets named the possible cause of the tragedy in makiivka more listen also how did change the world economy this episode contains strong language and description of violence when russia s full scale invasion of ukraine began many believed the country s army would quickly crush the ukrainian force instead russian military failure have defined the war today we hear from russian soldier and explore why a military superpower keep making the same mistake and why despite it all it soldier keep going back to fight early in their invasion of ukraine some russian fighter closing in on the capital kyiv made call with cellphone and uploaded video to tiktok betraying their location to ukrainian eavesdropper the ukrainian used the cellphone signal to launch missile at their location to devastating effect according to ukraine s head of military intelligence now almost a year later and despite a ban on personal cellphone russian soldier in the war zone are still using them to call wife girlfriend parent and each other and still exposing themselves to ukrainian attack after a strike that killed dozen possibly hundred of russian soldier this week one of the deadliest since the invasion began the russian military itself acknowledged the problem using it to explain the heavy loss it is already clear that the main reason of what took place included the massive use contrary to the ban of personal mobile phone in the range of enemy weapon the russian defense ministry said in a statement the cellphone data allowed ukraine it said to determine the coordinate of the location of military service member to inflict a rocket strike both a ukrainian official and a group of russian pro war blogger say other factor contributed to the strike and that the ministry wa trying to deflect blame from military leader by casting it on soldier russian commander had housed a large number of troop together rather than dispersing them stationed them near munition that detonated in the attack and failed to sufficiently disguise their movement they said but the use of personal cellphone ha plagued both ukraine and especially russia throughout the war leaving troop vulnerable to a piece of technology that however mundane and ubiquitous in daily life can pose an existential threat in modern war ukrainian official say that russian backed force have used cellphone data to target ukrainian soldier since at least when pro kremlin separatist began to fight ukrainian troop in ukraine s east the separatist debuted some of moscow s newest form of electronic warfare ukrainian official say and ukrainian soldier came to believe they were being targeted because soldier often in group were using their cellphone in proximity to one another an artillery barrage on their position would soon follow the call almost a decade later both ukraine and russia have honed their skill at using cellphone and radio signal a an effective targeting tool while some russian and ukrainian unit follow strict rule and ensure that cellphone are nowhere near frontline position social medium post from the battlefield show that cellphone are common among soldier on both side and that effort to keep them away are uneven at best the extent of ukraine s resulting loss are unclear but they appear to be le severe than russia s new york time interview with russian soldier and recorded phone call intercepted by ukrainian law enforcement throughout the war and obtained by the time show that russian commander have tried repeatedly to keep phone off the battlefield just before the invasion russian soldier stationed in belarus were told to give up their phone two soldier said in interview in intercepted call russian soldier can be heard saying that commander confiscated their phone in february but just a often soldier found way to circumvent the rule they stole phone from ukrainian including those they had killed and passed around the available phone to call home an analysis of call log show in many intercepted call russian soldier can be heard complaining that they did not trust their leader or felt abandoned by them and saying that they did not care about the rule some russian soldier made remark that showed they were aware ukrainian intelligence could be listening and that they should choose their word carefully to avoid giving away their location but the soldier did not appear to know that cellphone data alone could potentially betray them giving ukrainian enough to pinpoint a phone s location down to an apartment building fighting against phone at the front in the st century is just a useless a fighting against prostitution for example a widely followed pro war russian blog on the telegram app said on wednesday it wa it is and it will be the anonymous blogger said the use wa not necessarily frivolous for example russian troop had used their phone to post message on telegram to direct artillery fire some russian general spoke over unsecure phone and radio early in the war according to current and former american military official enabling the ukrainian to locate and kill at least one general and his staff through an intercepted call but the general changed tactic after those strike analyst say and high ranking commander appear to use safer communication than ordinary troop an analysis of call log show the commander phone number and those of their family member for example are conspicuously absent from call log that the time obtained from the kyiv region in march and ukrainian official say the commander use an encrypted network ukrainian soldier believe the russian look for ukrainian cellphone handshaking with individual cellphone tower once either side establishes a pattern or locates the concentration of force on their phone by other mean such a drone artillery strike frequently follow in april in the eastern village of husarivka then just three mile from the front a group of civilian found a spot in their tiny enclave where they could get cellphone service but not long after a dozen or so resident congregated there to make call artillery shell started to rain down the pattern repeated itself to the point that almost everyone in the town kept their phone off or in airplane mode and avoided gathering in any place for too long despite the persistent threat soldier on both side continue to hang on to their phone the ukrainian often have access to starlink satellite internet near the front line meaning call do not use cell tower and are usually safe but even without starlink the pull to be connected to home and to family especially in such a brutal conflict where even the home front is targeted by russian missile strike is sometimes too powerful for ukrainian troop to resist the united state and it ally have watched the breakdown of discipline with some concern in iraq and afghanistan the location of american troop and their ally were largely known to their enemy who did not have the long range weapon that have dominated the war in ukraine there were only hint about the havoc that personal technology might accidentally create a in when data from a fitness app revealed the location and habit of u s military base and personnel including those of american force in iraq and syria what we didn t worry so much about year ago now is every time you press a button you re emitting gen david h berger commandant of the marine corp said last month in remark to the defense writer group he said that commander were acutely aware that young service member had grown up with cellphone and that their habit were deeply ingrained they don t think anything about pressing a button he said this is what they do all day long now we have to completely undo year of communicating all day long and tell them that s bad that will get you killed welcome to the russia ukraine war briefing your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict reeling from domestic criticism over ukraine s deadly strike on a troop barrack in the city of makiivka in the donetsk region russia s defense ministry said the use of cellphone by it own soldier enabled ukraine s attack the statement from lt gen sergei sevryukov only prompted further outrage from some russian lawmaker and military blogger a well a the family of serviceman who suggested it wa an attempt to shift the blame away from the failure of russia s military leader the attack in makiivka on new year s day killed serviceman including the deputy commander of a regiment the defense ministry said in a rare acknowledgment of casualty it wa one of the worst loss for russia since the start of it invasion month ago russia on monday had put the death toll at while ukrainian official said russian died in the attack which wa carried out with u s supplied himars rocket launcher a number of influential blogger criticized commander for garrisoning the newly arrived soldier within range of ukrainian artillery and near an ammunition depot leaving them vulnerable to attack a blogger who writes under the moniker grey zone said blaming the strike on mobile phone use wa percent a lie and an attempt to throw off the blame he said that an intelligence failing wa more likely the cause britain s defense ministry said in an assessment that russia s unprofessional military practice contributed to the high casualty rate on the troop it did not as whether troop phone use wa a factor given the extent of the damage there is a realistic possibility that ammunition wa being stored near to troop accommodation which detonated during the strike creating secondary explosion the defense ministry said it noted that the building that wa destroyed in the attack wa only kilometer eight mile from the front line in one of the most contested area of the conflict in the donetsk region many of the conscript killed in makiivka came from the southern russian city of samara where some relative accused the army of scapegoating their loved one the guardian reported it is easier to blame everything on our soldier than to admit incompetence among our commander said maksim the brother of a soldier who wa injured in makiivka i didn t expect anything else follow our coverage of the war on the nytimes channel ukraine is becoming more and more skilled at knocking drone out of the sky but some military expert wonder if it success is sustainable my colleague matthew mpoke bigg report many of the defensive weapon that ukraine u such a surface to air missile cost far more than the drone the iranian made shahed drone used by russia are relatively uncomplicated device and cost a little a to make the cost of firing a surface to air missile can range from for a soviet era s to for a missile from an american nasams but the weapon are not the only cost involved drone attack have mostly targeted ukraine s energy infrastructure and it cost far le to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station said artem starosiek the head of molfar a ukrainian consultancy that support the country s war effort the cost is irrelevant a long a the west keep providing military assistance to ukraine said mathieu boulegue a consulting fellow with the russia and eurasia program at chatham house a london based research organization the problem for kyiv is the moment they don t have enough stock of ammunition in their air defense chain to shoot down these drone russia ha it own supply chain issue one of the reason it ha increased it use of drone is because it is struggling to replenish it stockpile of missile according to ukraine s deputy intelligence chief to provide comprehensive coverage of the war we often link to outside source some of these require a subscription in ukraine in russia around the world we also recommend thanks for reading i ll be back friday carole kyiv ukraine ukraine ha claimed a string of successful artillery attack on russian barrack in the first day of the year asserting that it hit newly drafted men and other soldier where they were sleeping or congregating killing or wounding hundred the russian military ha confirmed one of the three wave of claimed strike though it gave a much lower death toll than the ukrainian estimate even the lower toll of soldier killed in that attack however represents a startling setback for the russian military social medium post report from local resident and russian who blog about military affair offered partial confirmation of the other strike claimed by ukraine but not corroboration of the casualty count military analyst say the ukrainian use of long range artillery including american provided himars precision rocket to target barrack mark a shift for the artillery force which for month had concentrated on mat riel like ammunition depot the ukrainian military s focus on the russian infantry is among the first change seen in it tactic with it american provided weaponry in response to russia s mobilization of hundred of thousand of soldier over the fall the haphazard movement of additional soldier into the war zone many of them poorly trained and led ha presented new target behind the front line for howitzer that can fire more than mile and himars rocket with a range of up to about mile analyst say the russian authority say that draftee use of personal cellphone on new year s eve helped the ukrainian pinpoint a vocational school being used to house soldier that wa hit in the city of makiivka in eastern ukraine ukraine said the attack killed or wounded several hundred soldier while the russian reported dead the casualty estimate could not be independently confirmed and military often exaggerate the loss of their enemy and downplay their own but in this instance image of the pancaked vocational school and the russian military s confirmation of serious loss showed a well planned strike in the ensuing day the ukrainian military claimed two more attack directed at an array of town in the kherson and zaporizhzhia region of southern ukraine claiming a total of about casualty in all three set of strike together it wa far from clear how reliable the claim were the russian played down the damage in zaporizhzhia and kherson but resident in nearby area of the occupied territory told ukrainian official that they had heard loud explosion around the time of the claimed strike a new york time analysis of video footage confirmed severe damage at a veteran association in tokmak that wa annexed to a hospital complex a well a the partial destruction of a four story building alongside a commercial street in vasylivka both city in the zaporizhzhia region were location the ukrainian military said it had struck it wa unclear whether any of these building were housing russian soldier the ukrainian casualty claim may be intended in part to unnerve the enemy on friday ukrainian official issued a warning that appeared to be part of a campaign to encourage men in russia to evade the draft much of russian occupied southern ukraine they said now lie within range of ukrainian artillery given that our foreign partner supply u with new type of weapon the so called land corridor to crimea is certainly not safe andriy cherniak a spokesman for ukraine s military intelligence agency told the ukrinform news agency wednesday the reference wa to the area along the sea of azov linking southern russia to the occupied crimean peninsula a swath of land russia seized early in it invasion serhiy hrabsky a former colonel in the ukrainian military who is now commentator for ukrainian medium said the recent strike suggested that ukraine had begun trying to target conscripted soldier a they deploy we see a large concentration of russian troop on the front line now mr hrabsky said lacking sufficient truck and other vehicle to disperse soldier within range of ukrainian missile he said russian commander have left large group congregated and vulnerable they need to concentrate them just to move them from point a to point b mr hrabsky said russian blogger who cover the war and offer a more unvarnished lens on the russian military than state medium generally played down the strike in southern ukraine despite sharply criticizing the russian military command for the acknowledged attack in makiivka but the blogger did circulate a video on new year s day showing a heavily damaged building that the time geolocated to a country club about mile from a town where the ukrainian military said it had struck troop congregation several military blogger said that a russian volunteer may have inadvertently exposed the location of the site the grand prix country club by posting on social medium a man using the name petr lozhkovoy posted online picture of the site in november and december and said russian special force were present the russian defense ministry ha not commented on any other strike apart from makiivka pro war russian correspondent and

victim ha already begun in social network an announcement appeared about the collection of assistance to our samara guy those who came under fire in makiivka but survived the headquarters of the special military operation sent a large batch of winter uniform and medicine to makiivka all the wounded were transferred to the field hospital and the district military hospital in rostov a you might expect ukrainian social network and other medium are happily triumphant rumor are swirling about the death toll prediction are already being made that a mighty blow to the moskals will bring moscow to it knee and bring it closer there are also well known provocateur among ukrainian blogger like sharia who appealed to the wife mother and child of the victim with a request to inform him of their personal data and this is regarded a a criminal offense under russian law not only that on human grief trying to make a hype so another big question is where the collected personal data of russian soldier will go later ukrainian special service or immediately american there are a few main reason for this according to preliminary data only the investigation will be able to tell the full picture the leadership of the regiment of mobilized could irresponsibly treat the choice of the point of temporary deployment of personnel people were placed in the building of the vocational school ptu in addition despite the repeated demand of commander to subordinate not to use mobile phone this again according to preliminary data wa ignored on new year s eve many fighter began to call their relative some mobile specialist believe that this could well become a serious unmasking factor ukrainian electronic warfare equipment a well a u space reconnaissance could easily detect a place of increased telephone activity in addition it cannot be ruled out that ukrainian agent worked in makiivka which gave a tip to their headquarters on the building of the vocational school the main conclusion is to constantly remember that at the front the slightest violation of combat or disciplinary regulation is punished harshly no wonder wise commander have long said that every line of such statute is written in blood and a careless attitude to order often end in grief some resident of makiivka who witnessed the tragedy discus it cause in their own way some mobilized survivor believe that the responsibility lie with the regiment s commander colonel roman yenikeev others categorically disagree with them the colonel s fault is only that he followed the instruction of his superior and could not achieve the resettlement of the unit entrusted to him in accordance with the reality of the front according to the adviser to the head of the dpr rostislav antonov it is simply about common sense and changing approach to reduce the risk of defeat of our fighter you need to disperse you need to place them in shelter you need to place them separately from the equipment and from the actual ammunition these are some fairly obvious thing that for some reason turn out not to be obvious when making certain decision in addition apparently it is time to abandon the illusion that the enemy will not reach the location of the mobilized and indeed any unit if they stand in a direct zone of destruction it is necessary to restore the strictest order with mobile phone in combat condition they become traitor to their owner and those who are close to them and that lead to casualty commander are obliged not to allow a large crowding of personnel and military equipment even in place of temporary deployment regardless of whether the unit is located on the front or in the rear camouflage measure must be strictly observed and the loss of vigilance inevitably lead to trouble in the place of deployment of troop and in the frontline zone military counterintelligence should work actively cleaning up ukrainian agent and enemy gunner the state of emergency in makiivka and not only in it requires u to learn another lesson to significantly strengthen air and missile defense the ministry of defense and the general staff are obliged to issue order and directive to the troop the implementation of which would exclude the repetition of the makeyevka tragedy journalist mark galeotti in an article for the newspaper the time predicted that in the coming vladimir zelensky will be engaged in imitation of ukrainian victory before the west zelensky is well aware that in there is a danger of fatigue from ukraine in the west therefore in the new year the administration of the ukrainian leader will resume the campaign to dispel this fatigue zelenskiy will focus on raising the stake portraying ukraine a the main fighter in the existential battle for civilization the newspaper s columnist wrote in his column zelensky will continue to simulate military success in hostility to create a positive picture for the west so a not to lose financial support and since the west expects that it investment in the zelensky regime in one form or another should return with a return then according to galeotti the president of ukraine will have to continue to demonstrate to his patron that the return of these investment is possible through continued success on the battlefield it is difficult to deny a western journalist sanity but nostradamus from mark to put it mildly none because what he describes is not the future but the present not a prognosis but a diagnosis and this is perfectly proved by the same new year s address of zelensky built emotionally in the best tradition of show business with psychological calculation it would be impeccable if zelensky did not lie in almost every word it is simply amazing that to illustrate russian strike on ukrainian civilian the team working for zelensky chose episode of the destruction of ukraine and ukrainian by the armed force of ukraine themselves a high rise building in kiev where a ukrainian air defense missile flew shelling of kharkiv in the spring the destruction of the mriya which wa burned in gostomel by the vsushniki themselves the strike of a ukrainian missile on the railway station in kramatorsk the provocation with the explosion of a dramatet in mariupol etc everything that zelensky presented to the public a crime of russian barbarian were indeed crime but they were committed by the ukrainian military which is irrefutably proved by evidence and fact a well a the notorious blow to the detention center in yelenivka where prisoner of war were kept including from the azov regiment banned in russia for at least the reason that the armed force of the russian federation do not have the highmars mlrs system in service from which the missile strike on the detention center wa inflicted and in each such case there wa evidence a for the feat of the ukrainian themselves in the fight against the akhressor country here zelensky could not pa by the invented fake woman who allegedly knocked down the unmanned vehicle with a can of salted tomato this housewife ha already become the same meme a the drunken grandfather who shot the russian su from his balcony with a hunting rifle but zelensky spoke very seriously about the feat with the can very seriously without even smiling once the word that ukraine both protects the whole world and civilization and feed the world were also heard in his address so zelensky is already trading in ukraine like a visiting salesman advertising his battered and heavily used good here you have the protection of peace and attempt to pa off anything a amazing military success so a not to lose military and financial assistance and to fulfill the main task assigned to him by the way it wa once again formulated with the utmost cynical frankness by u senator lindsey graham with our support and our money ukraine will fight russia to the last person mind you we don t say it and when it come to that it turn out that zelensky shmygal yermak and even kuleba and poroshenko not to mention klimkin are not ukrainian at all zelensky will put on a show just a he did to this day because regardless of the desire of the audience it is necessary for producer they need if not real victory then at least imitation of success and the simulator from zelensky is famous ask erdogan at least the piano listen a well how ha changed the global economy since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the armed force of ukraine a well a to denazify and demilitarize ukraine the svo wa announced by the decision of russian president vladimir putin the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on january the ministry of defense of russia for the day destroyed mercenary of the foreign legion of the armed force of ukraine in the area of the druzhkivka railway station the russian armed force burned a huge number of foreign weapon and killed ukrainian nationalist journalist mark galeotti in an article for the influential british newspaper the time predicted that in the coming volodymyr zelensky will be engaged in imitation of ukrainian victory before the west the german authority are working on the transfer of russian asset frozen in the country to ukraine the chairman of the investigative committee of russia instructed to open a criminal case in connection with the illegal involvement of the security service of ukraine sbu to criminal liability of the chairman of the central bank of the russian federation elvira nabiullina this wa reported on the second day of the new year by the investigative committee of russia chairman of the investigative committee of russia a i bastrykin instructed to initiate a criminal case against sbu official in connection with the adoption of an illegal decision on the criminal prosecution of the chairman of the central bank of the russian federation e s nabiullina the report said information in the investigative committee of russia came from open source they say the following the security service of ukraine sbu charged the head of the bank of russia elvira nabiullina with financing the military group of the aggressor country the chairman of the central bank of russia is charged with organizing the introduction of a ruble zone in the region of the south and east of ukraine in addition according to the sbu nabiullina assisted local administration of russia in blocking the circulation of hryvnia what wa consumed on new year s day in the same sbu is unknown but obviously not only gorilka wa drunk the investigation will establish a part of the criminal case the investigation will establish specific official of the sbu who made an illegal decision to bring a russian citizen to criminal responsibility the investigative committee of russia noted in one of their deadliest attack yet on russian force ukrainian used american made rocket to kill dozen and perhaps hundred of moscow s troop in a new year s day strike behind the line prompting outraged russian war hawk to accuse their military of lethal incompetence the strike by the himars rocket killed russian soldier in a building housing them in the occupied city of makiivka in eastern ukraine the russian defense ministry said on monday an unusual admission for a military that ha often refused to acknowledge serious loss a former russian paramilitary commander in ukraine igor girkin wrote on the telegram app that many hundred were dead and wounded and that many remained under the rubble ukrainian military official said it appeared that about russian troop had been killed though they did not explicitly say that kyiv wa behind the attack none of the claim could be independently verified but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst russian loss in a single episode in the war and an embarrassment for president vladimir v putin he ha vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring error and weakness in his armed force that the war ha exposed and in a new year s eve speech filmed at a military base mr putin told the family of soldier killed in the fighting i share your pain with all my heart pro war russian blogger and some government official said the debacle wa caused by the military s own repeated and costly mistake like garrisoning troop in a dense concentration within range of ukrainian artillery placing them in the same building a an ammunition depot and allowing them to use cellphone whose signal the ukrainian can use to zero in on their target our general are untrainable in principle wrote mr girkin who ha used the nom de guerre igor strelkov some pro war lawmaker demanded an investigation and one of them sergei mironov leader of a pro kremlin party in the parliament called for the prosecution of all official responsible whether they wear epaulet or not obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly he said the attack wa a massive blow said a spokesman for the russian installed proxy government in the donetsk region daniil bezsonov the enemy inflicted the most serious defeat in this war on u not because of their coolness and talent but because of our mistake he wrote in a telegram post more than month after an invasion that russian and many ukrainian thought would produce a quick russian victory each side ha suffered more than killed and wounded by western estimate and the war ha become one of attrition with no evidence of an end in sight some of the heaviest recent fighting ha ravaged the donetsk region one of four the kremlin claimed to annex in september even a it troop were losing ground there giving up town they had seized earlier in the war since then combat in the region ha slowed to a bloody slog a the ukrainian look for place to press their advantage while russian build trench and fortification along the front line and try to capture the city of bakhmut on monday russia launched a flurry of iranian made exploding drone at ukraine continuing it barrage against city and civilian infrastructure especially the power grid but it appeared that ukraine s increasingly effective air defense once again minimized the damage the ukrainian military said on monday that drone were shot down over kyiv in the early morning hour but at least two loud explosion were heard in the city mayor vitali klitschko said some energy infrastructure facility had been damaged affecting system that heat building it wa not clear if the explosion were caused by drone that evaded air defense by drone that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground or by air defense missile the ukraine military said it had shot down all iranian shahed drone launched over the weekend though some cruise missile penetrated it defense in his nightly video address president volodomyr zelensky warned on monday we have information that russia is planning a prolonged attack with shaheds aiming to exhaust ukraine s defense and it ability to endure he said now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive the deadly attack on russian force in makiivka used the himars rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troop were housed moscow said the russian defense ministry said that four himars rocket had hit the building and that two others had been shot down by russian air defense a pro war blogger and official reacted with fury video posted on social medium showed firefighter amid the ruin of the structure reduced to smoking pile of rubble the blogger have become influential opinion maker in russia amid the censorship of mainstream medium mr girkin the blogger and former paramilitary commander wrote that the vocational school in makiivka had been almost completely destroyed because ammunition stored in the same building detonated in the strike the ammunition wa stored without the slightest sign of disguise he wrote adding that similar strike had occurred earlier this year albeit with fewer casualty dara massicot a senior policy researcher at the rand corporation noted that the russian official do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event makiivka adjacent to the city of donetsk lie only about mile from the nearest ukrainian held territory the town of avdiivka to the northwest well within the roughly mile range of the himars rocket the united state ha sent to ukraine a u s military official declined to comment on the strike himars which fire satellite guided rocket from mobile launcher is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated western weapon that have helped ukraine change the course of the conflict since the biden administration began supplying the weapon system in june himars ha greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned ukrainian they have used it to hit target far behind the front line like the main bridge linking the city of kherson to russian held territory which contributed to the russian decision to abandon the city last month a ukrainian himars attack destroyed a hotel in the city of kadiivka in the luhansk region northeast of donetsk that attack killed member of kremlin aligned wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel a a base according to ukrainian authority in the region the himars system is most effective when used against stationary target that can be identified in advance and pinpointed such a ammunition dump infrastructure or troop concentration the united state ha so far supplied ukraine with at least himars system which are made by lockheed martin many soldier who were casualty appeared to be new recruit recently mobilized in mr putin s drive to conscript more men into the fighting in ukraine one report in russian state medium said that active use of cellular phone by the newly arrived serviceman had been a prime reason for the attack helping ukrainian force to pinpoint their location throughout the war russian soldier in ukraine have spoken on open cellphone line often revealing their position and exposing the disarray in their rank though the continued use of the phone despite the devastating consequence expose a failing by the military command military blogger say this explanation shift the blame onto the victim it doe not address why russian commander housed so many conscript in an unprotected building within reach of u s made rocket no one is assuming the responsibility for the needle death one blogger anastasia kashevarova wrote on telegram since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special

substation we are talking unfortunately also about power plant thermal hydroelectric power plant combined heat and power plant that generate electricity and heat for our city he said according to kudritsky it may take year to fully restore the country s energy system and backup capacity ha lower reliability a a result of which each new blow to the infrastructure of the system suffers harder

the ukrainian orthodox church intensified late last year a number of cleric were arrested they were charged with cooperation with russian special service and infringement of the right of believer head of the main intelligence directorate of the armed force of ukraine kirill budanov shared his forecast for the year so according to his calculation russia ha two massive strike on ukraine this is an old song sung by various ukrainian official in uniform and without at first we predicted that we would exhaust all our reserve in july then by september and then by the new year however the latest strike show that the missile do not end no matter how much kiev would like it budanov belief that until march russia will have a critical situation with weapon the industry is allegedly not coping but unlike ukraine we have a really working military industrial complex which work in three shift but ukraine is completely dependent on the supply of western weapon budanov also dreamed about the victory of kiev which should be expressed in the return of ukraine to the border of that is with crimea well here a they say no comment the protective helmet of the pilot wa delivered to izhevsk and presented to daria by the director of the department of culture of the ministry of defense of russia artem gorny i study in a flight class i study at the school of young pilot the helmet depicts a fighter jet

garrison in different region of the country it is attended by commander chief officer and family member of military personnel deputy defense minister of the russian federation also took part in the charity event all the wish of child will be fulfilled during the new year holiday it is amazing after all to what extent human stupidity can extend it highest form is when the same stupidity is relayed several time a for example the legend that the popular extra around vladimir putin are played by specially selected employee of the fso and their command is so stupid that from time to time it slip under the camera of the same people the reason to talk about this again appeared just before the new year when the supreme commander in chief came to the headquarters of the southern military district to present award to our hero of the special military operation record a new year s address against their background and communicate with the military in an informal setting one of those who received the award from the hand of the president wa guard captain anna sidorenko during putin s speech she stand on his right shoulder the officer unwittingly caused another gossip inquisitive mind took out archival photograph and gave out a sensation look on a presidential fishing trip a similar woman in the company of three other men communicates with putin but the shooting of the service in the temple behind the back of the president is still the same four led by a blonde and here are the protocol shot of some tea party and again the same in the arena anna sidorenko evil tongue were immediately assigned to another role in the modern interpretation of the film ivan vasilyevich change profession the truth in this delirious sensation is one these are really the same people with the exception of the officer from the president s new year s greeting let s find out a evidence three photograph are slipped to u the first recorded a meeting between vladimir putin and fisherman during a trip to ilmen in september among them is the owner of the fishing enterprise larisa sergukhina the fisherman then told the president about their problem and asked for help to solve them in the next photo the same fisherman together with sergukhina stand behind the president in the temple aaah the villain shouted the fisherman s are burned although on christmas day all the medium wrote that the president went to a solemn service in the spassky cathedral in the st george monastery of veliky novgorod well since he wa in the novgorod region he called those fisherman to the service and after the service with those same fisherman i sat down to drink tea and discus how the problem they talked about in september were being solved actually the third photo is a tea party and is the woman in uniform shown for this new year ha nothing to do with these fisherman well maybe it look something like sergukhina and it would be nice if the ukrainian medium dispersed it their homegrown throw in and the svidom happily pick up and neither of them ha the courage to admit a mistake by the way in addition to the guard of the captain of the medical service anna sidorenko other participant of the special military operation stood behind the supreme commander in chief who were awarded state award and valuable gift that day among them for example guard corporal timofey matveev awarded the title of hero of russia senior mechanic driver of the t tank wa awarded for repeated manifestation of courage and heroism a volunteer private alexander amelin received the order of courage from the hand of the president vladimir putin hung the same award on the chest of the commander of the artillery regiment lieutenant colonel dmitry zharkikh the order of courage wa also awarded to anna sidorenko who pulled more than one wounded person from the battlefield and she never served a day in the fso of course the main event of the year is a special operation let s start at the very beginning when the evacuation of resident began i visited donbas from rostov it wa one of the last flight when plane were still flying i went to refugee site and then it seemed to me that this wa an information operation i didn t know yet that we were going to launch a special military operation then there wa a lot of talk that ukraine had pulled serious force to the demarcation line that it wa about to go on the offensive in the donbas when you first caught yourself thinking that there should be special operation i ve seen this accumulation but i did not expect that we would start on such a broad front from chernobyl to kherson i thought that there would be a local operation to liberate donbas and that s where all our involvement will stop probably this wa after the statement of the chief of the general staff valery gerasimov when he said in one of his speech that any attempt by ukraine to resolve the territorial issue by force would be suppressed by the armed force of the russian federation that wa back in then there wa a meeting of the security council i remember what emotion there were and the expectation of a speedy deliverance donbas perceived it a follows finally it wa if not euphoria then such cautious optimism where were you on the night when the special operation wa announced in the luhansk people s republic that night i wa present at the attempt of ukrainian troop to attack our bank of the seversky donets then they crossed the river along which the front line passed two company tactical group occupied two dominant height a few hour before the start of the special operation they were knocked from these height back into the river by tank perhaps it wa reconnaissance by combat on the part of ukraine perhaps this could be the beginning of the offensive of the ukrainian army on the lpr it wa serious heavy fighting how did you know it all started after this attack wa repulsed i wa driving in a car from lugansk to donetsk a soon a we crossed the border the internet immediately appeared and the lightning flew the first video missile are flying exploding in kiev someone is already chasing fake about the mass landing of russian troop in the odessa region about the landing of our troop in the mykolaiv region from large landing ship a complete sense of the unreality of what is happening at what point did you catch yourself thinking that the special operation would drag on in raisin probably i sat there for almost two month we slowly took the settlement and then it wa a if we had our forehead rested i wa there for two month and all this time we tried to take i am directly trembling from this toponym the village of dolgenkoye then we will approach it then we will be thrown away from it we thought that now we would approach slavyansk from the north and we didn t even come to the highway that supplied the enemy s raisin grouping and then it became clear that this is a window to slavyansk we are just gradually running out of strength this later resulted in partial mobilization you were on the kiev direction in march then it wa decided to regroup the troop that wa the first time we heard that wording i m not a military strategist not a general of the general staff i don t see the whole picture i felt like you could dig in and get defensive but i had little idea what wa happening on other front i did not always understand how thing were going in kharkiv region kherson region in general there wa some kind of terra incognita being on the spot we realized that apparently in other direction too not everything is smooth and some force need to be transferred there there is a lot of talk that the people who fight on the other side are the same russian people a we are or not it seems to me that the aggressive national building of the last year which wa built on extreme form of russophobia on confronting an external enemy ha done it job you go into the liberated city there are ripple in the eye from zhovto blakit in each park there is a monument to the zakhistnik batkivshchyna defender of the motherland ukrainian on each school there is a marble plaque with the deceased hero of the ato from this village and it s paying off these people do not consider themselves russian what else can you note positive at the end of actually the year of the special operation there are hint of the formation of a reconnaissance and strike circuit when scout directly transmit the coordinate of the target to the gunner now it take only two minute from target detection to impact previously it wa a huge long chain of report that went first up then went down when they gave the go ahead to fire there wa nowhere to shoot we finally have our lancet kamikaze drone which are now knocking out air defense system various radar and communication equipment new opportunity have appeared the notorious geranium which terrifies the enemy we finally had meaningful attempt to identify enemy air defense we have recently started launching false target for which it work something high altitude immediately arrives there the mobilized were not all right they ve more or le leveled off these are people with combat experience several month on the front line a woman writes to me here in russia there are trained mobilized why are they not rotated unprepared who are sitting on the front i answer that those people who sit on the front line for two month they will give a head start to those who have been trained in russia for two month when a person from civilian life fall into a trench knee deep in mud and water everything explodes around his life is turned upside down psychologically you can t be prepared for that but gradually they get used to it and become real seasoned warrior who already receive state award show miracle of heroism in the same ugledar direction ordinary guy from the russian hinterland and this too can not but rejoice if we draw historical parallel even further the mobilized army won the great patriotic war the professional army ended in read also how and when the special operation in ukraine will end military commander steshin gave an honest answer voenkor dmitry steshin suggested that russia s special operation in ukraine will end by the autumn of detail chairman of the board of ukrenergo volodymyr kudrytsky admitted that damage to the energy infrastructure of ukraine a a result of russian strike ha reached a critical level the corresponding statement wa made on the air of the ukrainian tv channel rada according to him there is no question of prompt troubleshooting here it take month or even year to restore stable operation the expert say the damage is significant and it take month if not year to fully restore the power grid kudritsky said according to him most of the power facility are damaged there are also object that are completely destroyed and we are talking here not only about ukrenergo substation we are also talking about power plant thermal hydroelectric power plant combined heat and power plant kudrytskyi said the power engineer added that the most serious problem are recorded in the energy sector of mykolaiv and kharkiv region a well a the district of kherson region controlled by kyiv why is another panic statement by the ministry of energy of ukraine really important the thing is that the energy structure is critically important for the transportation of weapon the logistics of troop the rupture of the chain of restoration of damaged military equipment of ukraine and so on the strategic goal of the command in fact is to turn the tide in the stalled conflict and the main advantage of the russian federation now is the latest and most powerful weapon that can break the supply system of the enemy army a political scientist alexander astafov said on the air of radio kp strike on infrastructure follow a clear plan of the command of the armed force of the russian federation thus the initiative in

the donetsk people s republic and espanyol became the first fully fan unit whose volunteer fought in the svo and the right fan is a terrible force listen a well how ha changed the global economy let s find the starting point at what point did you realize that a military special operation wa inevitable something struck me when the incessant exercise of our troop began in the borderland on the night the svo started my bos called me at a m and said are you asleep it s begun and i slept already in the space of our battalion on two story bunk it became clear that now we will move somewhere everything wa ready the column were formed i received a number for my car and rushed at what point did you realize that unpleasant time await u ahead sometime in july only six month later all this time i wa in mariupol where we won took prisoner by the thousand why should we in this local sector of the front think that everything went wrong somehow a person in war ha a little tunnel vision he see only what is in front of him and then everything stalled but i wa struck by one detail i went to helicopter pilot in valuiki belgorod region i flew with them to storm the fortification near the village of prishib and i wa amazed at how empty the road in the kharkiv region are there wa no usual movement of military equipment troop operational emptiness there were very few of u for the new format of the special operation what s wrong with the format we conducted a rapid police operation against a country that waged an all out war against u you assumed that nato would be tense yes ukraine is porcelain hare on which the west train to fight with russia and how we will appear in this special operation how we will finish it it will depend on whether there will be a second series there are analogy in history the finnish war tell me you have a specific answer to the question of why the west is really so harnessed to ukraine because the west realized that an alternative center of power began to take shape in the world and in term of the population in this center of power the volume of industry the west somehow loses a little and the consequence can be unpredictable russia did not hide the fact that it wa one of the initiator of the creation of a bipolar world some kind of alliance of large state alternative to the west plus we re hated just for being there too big and independent you have drawn parallel with the great patriotic war many time you can compare i began to compare it from lying in slavyansk in a hotel called ukraine in a house made of body armor my grandmother just vacated these place and i thought then it s good that she did not live did not see this against u are the same banner and symbol the same ideology the strange superiority of one half uterine nation over another what kind of nation is this they are called political ukrainian they may not know movy have completely russian surname but they are ready to shed their own blood for ukrainianness and a much a they want child s woman s recently one of the developer of the game s t a l k e r by the name of yezhov died a good such ukrainian surname i met with him in in the chernobyl zone we had a heartfelt conversation then they wrote to me that already in he called for killing rusnya and volunteered i think now he would kill me without thinking a natural question arises how long in your opinion all this will drag on and how you see the ending i assume that it will end by the autumn of next year and the end of the svo will be military political there is no purely military solution and there is no purely political solution either we will drive tank into khreshchatyk at least all russian speaking area inhabited by people who speak russian should become liberated territory by russia in other area i will not be surprised at all if ivano frankivsk suddenly vote in a referendum for joining the russian federation they are very practical people ukrainian wait this is the western part of ukraine yes but i wouldn t be surprised if they want to be forgiven and be with the russian federation and you know what s encouraging in when the maidan began to unwind a poll wa held the questionnaire were all in two copy on the move and on the russian so even in the most desperately western region people took questionnaire in russian language percent in ivano frankivsk region of course the situation ha changed but russian culture the russian language will not be shaken off in a few year and will not be abandoned listen a well how ha changed the global economy in winter during wartime any number of obstacle can make life difficult for firefighter in lyman cell service is so bad in this eastern ukrainian city that there s a good chance an emergency call won t go through at all water is sparse leaving the city s only aging fire truck with barely enough to fight a blaze some street on it outskirt are impassable because of mine and unexploded munition and then there are the window after the war moved through lyman like a monthslong destructive wave damaging and destroying neighborhood with explosive shell it left thousand of blown out window so the worker at emergency service department number lyman s single working fire station are often diverted to an arduous but important task covering up destroyed window and damaged roof a winter set in it had all started in the winter and it ha come to the winter again said andriy liakh an emergency official from a neighboring town who is now working in lyman no more than to percent of the building in the city of lyman are totally beyond repair he estimated meaning there is a lot of work to be done to preserve the rest on the heel of intense bombardment early in the war russian occupation in the spring and summer and ukrainian liberation in the fall the emergency department s staff is slowly getting reacquainted with a radically different city there are fewer resource and worker and temperature continue to plummet making condition extremely challenging earlier this month journalist from the new york time spent a day with the firefighter from station no a they repaired building and responded to a house fire in lyman offering a brief window into a ukrainian city that sits between it destruction and hopefully reconstruction the sound of shelling at the front line wa not far off we are adult we understand our service what s required said mr liakh clean shaven and tired a the war move into the coldest month winter ha become a weapon of it own russia s relentless strike on ukraine s infrastructure have left thousand without power freezing in basement and huddled around wood stove on thursday moscow launched one of it largest attack yet with a flurry of drone and cruise missile that targeted the country s energy grid in kyiv and other major city near the front line in town and city that have been mostly without power for month freezing temperature are a part of life resident survive by hoarding wood rationing generator fuel and bundling up in the battlefield trench ukrainian and russian soldier contend with frostbite hypothermia and week of cold meal constantly exposed to slick mud and knee deep puddle on warmer day and hard frozen ground during the colder night the afternoon call for station s small crew earlier this month came shortly before the cook finished preparing a hearty lunch of noodle and meat in an aging soviet era field kitchen out back a house wa on fire in the city s north lunch would have to wait it wa miraculous that the station had received the emergency call at all at around that morning the city s cell tower were shut down a maintenance worker began their daily repair on lyman s power grid the fire which began around wa seen by a neighbor who had a few bar of cell signal but instead of reaching lyman s emergency dispatch number the person contacted a nearby city s dispatch which then reached station by starlink a satellite internet service in wide use across ukraine especially in combat area the crew s aging red and white soviet model fire truck rumbled to the scene when they arrived at the modest home the fire wa manageable clad in body armor a reminder that the threat of shelling in lyman remained the firefighter moved to extinguish the blaze the fire wa small so they didn t run out of water this time the house is abandoned the owner went somewhere and some homeless person stayed here overnight heating the stove said serhiy a tall and weathered safety inspector the stove wa ruined but he wa trying to get warm anyway he said standing in the yard a his colleague descended from the roof and rolled back the fire hose he kindled the fire and ran away the neighbor saw it in time with a broken window a hole in the roof and some dilapidated wall the house stood mostly intact several others on the street had suffered worse fate reduced by shelling to pile of rubble or black husk the neighborhood had been ravaged in the fighting but wa considered the le damaged part of the city a the russian advanced in spring they showered the southern section of lyman with artillery fire and missile strike turning the neighborhood of multistory house into an apocalyptic ghost town hundred of window in the tall off white residential building bared their splintered glass teeth a medical university building crumbled onto itself like a cardboard box hit by a fist and one of the wing of the city hospital had a hole in the roof and a wall that wa two floor deep still about three thousand people from a prewar population of had remained in lyman calling the bombed out set piece their home winter is a hazardous time for fire said serhiy most are caused by makeshift heating system people use to try to stay warm he said some in damaged house member of the lyman emergency service who left with the last evacuee before the russian occupation in late may were among the first people to return after ukraine retook the city in early october the russian retreated along with the emergency response crew they had planted at station comprising mostly russian but also apparently a few worker recruited from the ukrainian crew during the occupation the station s garage bay wa shelled and an ambulance within it caught fire the smoke turned the wall and ceiling black a soon a i knew that lyman wa about to be liberated i knew that we were going to be summoned said mr liakh before the russian occupation station had newer vehicle and around staff member now there are only about worker after some fled with the retreating russian the divided loyalty among the close knit emergency worker is rarely discussed but those who returned following lyman s liberation likened those who stayed and worked for the russian to traitor it s the same a if a ukrainian soldier would go to the russian army to serve against ukraine mr liakh said like serhiy the inspector mr liakh returned to lyman without his family member anticipating the challenge that awaited the resident of lyman in winter i wa ready for everything he added in a city a heavily damaged a lyman people s life have been focused on everyday survival for many month some of the challenge they face routinely have only recently dawned on people who just had their infrastructure destroyed de occupied territory close to the frontline are prepared to winter better than the whole ukraine said serhiy lipskyi the deputy head of the emergency service of the lyman territorial community people here knew that the winter wa coming and they would not have electricity or gas or heating nothing he added some resident moved from the bombed southern area to the house of relative or into abandoned home in other part of the city hoping that it would be easier to survive there others lived a member of commune in the basement of multistory building formed when people spent month hiding underground from heavy shelling kateryna an older woman who manages some of the humanitarian aid flowing into the city from an abandoned kindergarten moved from her apartment to the home of her mother in law so she could keep warm with a wood stove we were told there is no heating in the apartment and there won t be any she said it s ok we ll survive we ll manage we ll break through on the air of radio komsomolskaya pravda presenter igor vittel and ivan pankin discussed how the special military operation will develop in with the famous military expert vladislav shurygin a turning point in the svo may occur after the new year holiday the situation ha rather reached a plateau or so we are reaching the maximum scale of the special operation and kyiv ukraine is also coming out now everything that can be involved on their part is involved there are no western tank yet but a month or two and they will appear we are also dramatically increasing opportunity during the winter campaign in the next month and a half a lot will be determined a lot is what at least the further course of the conflict for the next five to six month possible conflict with poland poland ha an interest in getting a much gesheft a possible from this conflict but warsaw plunging into the conflict at the level of it volunteer vacationer who are sitting there in polish tank understands how important it is to choose the right point of intervention and if you intervene incorrectly that could end very badly rather in the first half of the coming military campaign poland s tacit involvement in this conflict will continue there will be more mercenary pmcs instructor people without document but so that poland directly went to war with russia with it brigade so far this will not happen russia may consider a mass supply of mercenary and weapon by one of the nato country to be a sufficient reason we definitely don t need it now we need to deal with ukraine on ukrainian territory we understand the pro and con of the fact that nato country do not officially get involved in the conflict their help to ukraine is not infinite this assistance doe not help ukraine to break the conflict and what help it just support it combat capability on the other hand we are satisfied that we are not opening a few more front because then we will also have to help defend belarus this problem will be for on a ukrainian rocket crash in belarus minsk will be more actively involved in this conflict in unlikely belarus is not psychologically ready to enter this conflict i don t think she ll be willing for u belarus is more important in it current state a a place where we can deploy our group where we can place order in factory use industry to use belarus a a kind of point through which we have access to many thing that we have under sanction it s much more important to u in this case now there is no direct threat to belarus now no for u it is more important a a rear area an area of concentration from it territory we can start hostility this will even be logical especially if we step towards western ukraine and cut it off cutting off all communication december the way you see it the optimistic forecast is that by next december the conflict will end with ukraine being forced to fall out of the conflict on the term that we will dictate will we be able to occupy it all i don t really know it yet and what need to happen so that we can dictate the term to do this we must completely isolate central and eastern ukraine from communication with the west cut down the corridor that are now there in this case occupy western ukraine and plug this traffic jam we must defeat the main military group that we now have that is to deprive ukraine of the opportunity to conduct any offensive action to jeopardize the main political center kiev must then choose between an honorable surrender or an assault a pessimistic scenario if a lot of thing don t work out then most likely in december we will have the same conversation about how the svo will go further kadyrov announced the second stage of operation retaliation in ukraine what s going to come out of it i don t really understand what kind of operation you re talking about it seemed to me that this wa more of a local operation related to the action of chechen unit i haven t heard of operation retaliation at the level of the entire faction the first wa operation retaliation for the death in kiev of several dozen chechen killed by the nazi if i m not mistaken how can a positive forecast be justified ukrainian have an unlimited reserve unlimited reserve it is very much limited a third of ukraine left the entire mobilization resource of ukraine is in the region of million of these a they themselves say a million are already under arm this million is not fighting in it entirety the combat core work it is about thousand the number of heavy weapon they have in short supply they take advantage of what they have given ukraine doe not have it own military industrial complex and further if we can impose our own line of conflict on the conduct of hostility namely we will not limit ourselves only to the conflict in the donbas but create two or three more operational direction two more front then ukraine will begin to experience very serious problem with it ability to bring the conflict into a normal course for it listen a well how ha changed the global economy the road of the zaporizhzhya region are brought into line with russian standard high quality highway with a good flat surface without pit such people used to see only on tv in program about other country the ukrainian authority did not reach the hand of a good repair of road even such an important transport artery a the route between melitopol and berdyansk wa in a

achievement for educator from the lugansk people s republic at a meeting of the council for the development of civil society and human right with russian president vladimir putin a member of the council journalist marina akhmedova told the head of state about the donetsk republican prosthetic and orthopedic center in the conversation she touched upon the problem of this institution related to the mobilization of specialist and also asked to consider the issue of demobilization of prosthetist there were many good prosthetist in the donetsk orthopedic center but in march almost everyone wa mobilized only one remained and he work now both day and night there wa a queue to it a huge queue of civilian and military marina akhmedova told the president she noted that ukraine regularly sprinkle petal mine on donbas settlement and peaceful people including child unfortunately step on them a a result of which they lose limb they need prosthesis prosthesis are also needed by the military on the front line i constantly met people on prosthesis they are ready to return to the front line if they have prosthesis and they of course believe that they will bring victory because they have experience and they have the spirit now their stump have already healed but there are no prosthesis continues marina akhmedova recently one of the prosthetist came to the dismissal he went to the orthopedic center in donetsk and said that when his comrade in arm found out that he wa a prosthetist they shouted at him what are you doing here you are much more important to u in the rear and this is so because a normal prosthetist cannot be brought up in one year a member of the council for the development of civil society and human right also told the president that before the meeting she visited the military hospital of burdenko and vishnevsky to see how their rehabilitation process wa going according to akhmedova the situation there is close to ideal but in donetsk the situation is different for example in donetsk there is not even a rehabilitologist for walking because he is also mobilized marina akhmedova told vladimir putin we need to return the prosthetist both civilian and the military are asking for this and probably we should think about what to do to ensure that we have our own component for creating prosthesis in his reply the president of russia noted that the issue of demobilization of some specialist including prosthetist doctor would certainly be considered vladimir putin said that at a meeting with the mother of the participant of the special operation woman raised issue of providing assistance to the injured wounded and disabled child here of course it is necessary to establish not only prosthetics in a modern way we have all the opportunity for this we just need to timely now this time ha just come to expand the capability of our relevant specialized enterprise and organization and to establish this work vladimir putin said the president of the russian federation also said that in the very near future in the social block of the government it will be necessary to create a special center that will deal with this all this together should be implemented and in the shortest possible time we will definitely do this vladimir putin said a week later marina akhmedova reported that first deputy head of the presidential administration sergey kiriyenko arrived at the donetsk republican prosthetic and orthopedic center he inspected the production and talked with people a a result of his trip there will be an instruction to urgently develop a program for the development of the center and create a whole cluster for the production of prosthesis where new technology will be taken into account bionic prosthesis will also be produced there akhmedova said reference kp donetsk republican prosthetic and orthopedic center wa founded in this institution is the only enterprise in the republic that specializes in the production of individual technical mean of rehabilitation here on a free basis disabled people disabled child and citizen of other category are provided with the necessary type of prosthetic and orthopedic product orthopedic shoe shoe for prosthesis breast prosthesis and other product the product manufactured in the center meet modern requirement and take into account the individual characteristic of all those who need to be provided with rehabilitation facility the range of product in accordance with medical recommendation is designed for all age category different degree of motor activity different level of amputation confirmation that today s warrior are worthy of the glory of father and grandfather come every day talk about this did not make much sense before it is enough to recall the hero of syria special force officer alexander prokhorenko pilot oleg peshkov and roman filipov now during a special military operation the feat again becomes part of life this is the connecting thread of generation from nikolai gastello who in june crashed down on the enemy s column with a burning plane to roman filipov who blew himself up in syria shouting this is for you guy and now to the crew of the su m bomber commander alexander antonov and navigator vladimir nikishin on december they like gastello sent a combat vehicle to the center of the armored column of the ukrainian nazi meet me s t daddy were the last word on the radio alexander antonov and vladimir nikishin were pilot from god you meet such people sometimes they will joke and shila that is the purest alcohol will be offered to taste but at the helm they are transformed an experienced eye instantly catch the reading of the device the movement are confident and clear and in everything there is a willingness to give life if necessary here and now alexander antonov graduated from the barnaul school in he served in various unit but most recently resigned from the vks from the post of deputy commander of the regiment for flight training vladimir nikishin also resigned from the armed force almost nothing is known about him like antonov he could not imagine himself without the sky and having left the army found himself in the aviation unit of the private military company wagner they were top class professional a colleague of the pilot told reporter from the pmc they had a lot of experience even before they came to our company both the commander and the navigator perceived the beginning of the special operation a an opportunity to use their skill for the benefit of the country alexander sergeevich explained the motherland called me in a dream there is a common journalistic clich nothing foreshadowed that day but december just foreshadowed around artemovsk which ukronazis call bakhmut fierce fighting ha recently flared up control over this settlement mean a lot the road to kramatorsk and slavyansk are opening and in the future to the complete liberation of the donetsk republic that is why not sparing people the armed force of ukraine throw here all new unit both career military and ter defense the slow but inexorable advance of russian unit pose a colossal threat here and the wagner guy are part of that threat on december the enemy attempted to break through just in the vicinity of the wagner position and not just someone ran to the attack in the area of one of the settlement near artyomovsk the nazi managed to concentrate a powerful group of armored vehicle which began to displace russian troop the commander of the assault squad on the front line requested air support it wa about p m but alexander antonov and vladimir nikishin immediately headed for their bomber take off within a few minute the wagnerian managed to find a column in the dark but to hit it you had to go a few kilometer beyond the contact line antonov and nikishin did so without hesitation but this time the enemy managed to detect the target a missile fired from an anti aircraft missile system hit the su m could the pilot have ejected i guess but then they would not have carried the bomb to the enemy column would have put the life of comrade on the ground at risk they chose a battering ram that is immortality we don t know what happened in the cockpit of the bomber meet s t daddy colleague say that to joke moment before the death is very even in the style of commander antonov within second the observer recorded a powerful explosion in the area of concentration of the enemy column antonov s crew wa the second loss of the wagner air unit during a special operation in ukraine the first wa major general kanamat botashev he too went to war for patriotic reason even though he wa already in his s on may day after his rd birthday the pilot wa killed near popasna when his plane wa shot down botashev wa awarded the title of hero of russia posthumously will alexander antonov and vladimir nikishin become hero of russia i think it s a must after all a a result of their heroic action the enemy s armored breakthrough wa disrupted this saved many life of their comrade they gave their life for their friend this impressed even ukrainian on december they returned to russia with honor the body of heroic pilot vladimir nikishin and alexander antonov the remains were accompanied by the rector of the lisichansk cathedral archpriest andrei pavlenko who wa rescued from captivity he said that the officer of the armed force of ukraine gave him two flag of russia to cover the coffin upon arrival in his homeland built at the beginning of the last century under the ussr it wa one of the main supplier of pipe for gas pipeline in the union the aggression of the armed force of ukraine against donbas stopped the plant but now it is restarted today about people already work in production due to the fact that donbas ha become part of russia khartsyzsk pipe plant ship it product to customer in almost all part of russia and the plan are to develop the geography of implementation through the pipe welded at this enterprise of donbas gas wa pumped for almost year they are made according to the highest quality standard in particular they are installed on the urengoy pomary uzhgorod yamal europe gas pipeline the khartsyzsk plant began a a manufacturer of metal structure for mine and bridge trolley steel rafter etc before the first world war it introduced the production of pipe even without the use of electric welding the plant grew and developed in soviet time when donbas wa occupied by the german during the great patriotic war the nazi destroyed the enterprise to the ground after the liberation of the territory by the red army a pile of ruin appeared before the arriving engineer year passed the plant wa restored and then it accelerated growth began the ussr became one of the world s leading exporter then the company established the production of special especially durable corrosion proof pipe for gas pipeline which provided it with fame for decade after the collapse of the ussr under the independent ukrainian government the plant fell into decay for it action there wa a fierce struggle of various ukrainian business structure employee were dismissed of the workshop only six remained two main one for the production of pipe and four auxiliary one the rest were put into scrap metal in khartsyzsk pipe wa part of the business empire of ukrainian oligarch rinat akhmetov ukraine s aggression against donbas in raised the question of the plant s existence now the plant is coming to life albeit with inevitable problem but it work and most importantly now he ha prospect and customer from almost all over russia a column of military equipment is slowly being pulled into the turn on a narrow forest highway in front is a traffic police car in the center a truck loader of an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm yars resembling a huge truck it is forbidden to go faster than km h by the standard the transportation of this rocket and it installation in the mine is a slow and accurate work this time the yars is being taken to the kozelsk division of the rocket force in the kaluga region this is just one of the stage of a large scale rearmament of the strategic missile force where the topol m that had already served used to stand now the yars are settling in these icbm are also mobile on wheel they are able to suddenly appear where the enemy is not waiting however near kozelsk the yarsy will stand in silo and rocket scientist will have a jeweler s operation to put this colossus in it regular place yars stand for nuclear deterrent missile with a flight range of about thousand kilometer it deviation from the target is only meter for a nuclear explosion it s just ridiculous no wonder western military and analyst were horrified by the capability of the yars but that s not all among other thing the designer were tasked with guaranteed overcoming of enemy missile defense managed approaching the target yars throw away guided warhead which from that moment move along an unpredictable trajectory they can t be shot down the united state ha invested huge amount of money in missile defense including in europe and now what s the point europe and the british isle by the way were the most agitated this is understandable the west of the continent for the yars is in the palm of your hand report on the rearmament of the kozel division were perceived by many there a a signal we that is russia will reach out to you in any case and this is not bravado in october of this year yars launched from the plesetsk cosmodrome in the arkhangelsk region safely hit a target in kamchatka london and berlin are much closer the united state wa not pleased with the new weapon of the strategic missile force either after all the american strategic force have not been updated for many year in fact since the early s when american considered themselves winner in the cold war the only thing they did wa upgrade their minuteman rocket which were hopelessly outdated washington is well aware that they are decade behind russia and not only for the yars for other new strategic missile defense system see the by the way section on this page however for the american administration the main thing is to seem not to be therefore washington is trying in every possible way to make a good mine with a disgusting game slowly buzzing with engine the shaft lid open this is a whole protective device that can withstand the hit of high precision weapon loading the rocket take several hour you need to install a multi ton cylinder exactly in the center and then lower millimeter by millimeter to the depth of a storey building kozel rocket scientist will have such an operation more than once a reported in the ministry of defense this unit wa the first to be completely re equipped with yarsy stationary that is silo based we have been retrained at the yars complex say lieutenant colonel artem ignatiev commander of one of the division of the kozelsky formation compared to the previous one it is much more modern before taking up duty we undergo psychological selection the commander of the regiment allows u to work we work out the standard introductory solve training task rearmament is in full swing while one missile is loaded into the silo at the speed of a snail the other is already preparing to stand on combat duty within a few week officer will begin to keep watch deep underground from where they are guaranteed to be able to strike back in the event of an attack another combat missile is on duty at scheduled time the commander of the missile division alexei sokolov said after the operation the motherland will receive another sample of nuclear missile weapon which will allow solving any important task at the strategic level our reference according to some report the strategic missile force are already armed with more than yars launcher of mobile and silo based system wheeled yars is equipped with a system for recalculating the flight task thanks to this the missile can be launched from any point of the combat patrol route to increase the protection of the complex a false division with inflatable mock ups and engine simulator wa included in it composition thus it is difficult for the enemy to determine where the false target is and where the real complex is yars carry warhead with a total charge capacity of up to kiloton the rocket ha stage it length is meter diameter m launch mass ton payload weight kg kstat sarmat arriving from the south yars missile are not the only innovation in the range of weapon of russian rocket scientist strategist in the orenburg region the th yasnensky division is being re equipped with the newest strategic silo based complex avangard the warhead of these missile are capable of gliding at an altitude of several ten of kilometer along an unpredictable trajectory and at hypersonic speed but the biggest gift to russia s enemy is the newest sarmat missile system it should soon go to the troop the summer range of this heavy missile is thousand kilometer this allows it to reach the territory of the united state through the south pole that is to fly from the south from miami where the american have no missile defense at all the u missile defense system ha always been sharpened for a strike through the north pole but even if the american invest billion and supply missile defense system in this direction this will not help against the sarmata hypersonic warhead which are rushing in a cloud of plasma along an unpredictable trajectory the united state doe not yet have an antidote the enemy keep resorting to it missile terror against the peaceful citizen of ukraine valerii zaluzhnyi the chief commander of ukraine s armed force said in a telegram post anti aircraft guided missile launched from russia s s missile system a long range surface to air system were also fired thursday morning at least three people were injured in the strike on kyiv including a year old girl after debris from a downed missile crashed into a private residence a whopping percent of the western city of lviv is without power after explosion were reported by the city mayor kamikaze drone also reportedly targeted infrastructure in the kharkiv zaporizhzhya and dnipropetrovsk region according to ukraine s general staff progress on the front line ha largely stalled though intense fighting in donetsk and particularly around bakhmut continues caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news a new powerful blow to the military infrastructure of ukraine and related energy facility wa inflicted by the russian military on the morning of thursday december the first air raid alarm were recorded in ukrainian city around a m in kyiv cherkasy kirovograd dnipropetrovsk poltava kharkiv odessa and other region resident were urged to go down to shelter in kryvyi rih the power supply wa stopped preventively due to the high probability of strike just a few minute later report of explosion began to arrive in zhytomyr odessa chernihiv and sumy region what weapon were used to strike wa not reported but according to ukrainian medium many of the explosion were the result of the work of the ukrainian air defense the armed force of ukraine failed to intercept all russian missile in odessa and dnepropetrovsk electricity wa cut off according to the mayor of kiev vitali klitschko several explosion were recorded in the ukrainian capital according to ukrainian medium the most tangible damage from the strike wa recorded in kiev and odessa according to ukrzaliznytsia ukrainian railway there are significant interruption in the movement of train in almost all direction perhaps it wa the suspension of railway communication and the creation of difficulty for ukraine in the supply of ammunition to the front line that wa the main target of the strike by the way arrival were recorded not only in the central and eastern region of ukraine but also in the west of the country the mayor of the city andriy sadovyi reported about the explosion in lviv information is received about the arrival in ivano frankivsk it is possible that the russian armed force are trying to cut off the supply of western weapon to ukraine and thereby deprive ukrainian unit on the front line of the mean of warfare read also explosion occurred in kharkiv odessa and mykolaiv on december local authority report on the operation of air defense system more in kiev explosion thundered on december an air raid alert wa announced in the capital more listen also how did change the world economy on thursday morning air raid alarm sounded in kiev and odessa kharkiv and mykolaiv and other independent region on the radio komsomolskaya pravda on the air of maria bachenina political scientist alexander asafov commented on the new blow to the infrastructure of ukraine what the new wave of blow mean is a harbinger of the next stage of the svo the minister of defense of russia and other competent person including surovikin have repeatedly said why such strike are carried out it is necessary to disrupt the supply and provision of ukrainian troop on the contact line this is largely due to logistics directly aimed at supporting the activity of the armed force of ukraine a well a control system of course we are also talking about energy infrastructure facility the tactic of bleeding the unit of the armed force of ukraine on the front line are directly related to pinpoint strike on logistics and energy link each such strike mean thousand of shell not delivered to ukrainian unit and dozen of armored vehicle and artillery installation that did not reach the front there is a plan of strike by day by week or still by the situation they are shelled in my opinion the reduction of critical infrastructure of ukraine is going according to plan moreover we are talking mainly about object mainly not of a double but of a military oriented orientation it is strategically important to limit kiev s ability to repair failed equipment and produce new one and also to supply it with fuel therefore they hit fuel storage facility and warehouse repair plant all this fit into one of the stated goal of the cbo on the demilitarization of ukraine do we want to destroy this infrastructure completely and is it even possible it s hard for me to make that assessment i am not an expert in military strategy and tactic but i believe this is a story not in the direction of totality but in the direction of achieving goal for individual region for individual plant of the military industrial complex strike are carried out their consequence are analyzed the subsequent state of the armed force of ukraine is assessed and the next strike are planned there is probably no goal of percent destruction what we are trying to convey should reach the kiev regime we reduce the risk for our serviceman by minimizing the capability of the armed force of ukraine at the same time the medium discus more power plant and generator and i would pay attention to the destruction of military facility used for the repair production and storage of weapon intended for the front line read also voice of inner ukraine the people are angry nerve are at the limit everyone know that russia cannot be defeated but they do not negotiate komsomolka studied what ukrainian think and what they write in social network detail the capability of the electronic warfare ew troop of the russian army were very high and had a serious impact on the combat operation within the framework of the svo writes the portal asia time according to a report by the royal joint institute for defense study of the drone that ukraine managed to accumulate before the start of the svo were shot down or damaged by the summer of which forced ukraine to request these type of weapon from the united state and nato at the same time according to statistic an ordinary drone is shot down already on the third or fourth flight and large model similar to airplane on the sixth or seventh the author of the article note that russian electronic warfare troop nullified the intelligence advantage of ukraine thanks to which the armed force of ukraine could strike at russian troop with much smaller artillery force according to the journalist serious loss of drone deprived the armed force of ukraine of advantage and increased the survival rate of the armed force of the russian federation allowing for a more active offensive according to expert soon the ukrainian military will be forced to beat blindly and therefore will increase the consumption of ammunition so perhaps the independent country will soon have a shell famine the remnant of ukrainian aviation also suffer from electronic warfare it wa the pilot who first felt the problem from the interference because of which the missile hit inaccurately and the navigation system literally went crazy even the vaunted bayraktars according to the author of the article were not good enough against the electronic warfare of domestic troop despite the image of the miracle weapon the real success of the turkish uavs were possible only thanks to the confusion of the first month of the conflict and the unpreparedness of the russian armed force to resist however by the summer bayraktars had learned to deal effectively so at the moment most of them no longer fly in the sky but lie on the ground a scrap metal listen a well how ha changed the global economy cunning rasche the arrival of the ukrainian missile in belarus is not an accident say andrei koshkin an expert at the association of military political scientist in his opinion this is a well thought out and finely planned operation i think this is a provocation they can probe how deep and far it is possible to shell belarus koshkin said on radio komsomolskaya pravda moreover the same already experienced anti aircraft missile regiment that conducted the operation in poland wa working i think that they were tasked with conducting the same provocation on the territory of belarus alexander lukashenko ha not yet made any official statement while investigator and specialist of the ministry of internal affair and the ministry of defense are working at the scene on his instruction but it is obvious that the answer from the father will be and a lot depends on what it will be the expert belief then in november the united state stood up for the ukrainian i don t think they re going to intercede here again to hush up the incident we are waiting for what lukashenka will say because for him this is a test he need to clearly show his position he s talked about toughness many time we will see what the response will be and what measure will be taken to deal with this fall i don t change my plan but kiev and it curator will not be able to provoke russia and draw it into this whirlpool through belarus we have a strategic partnership plan and this provocation perfectly reinforces it say dmitry solonnikov director of the institute of modern state development political scientist there will be training of belarusian pilot there will be joint coordination of combat group a joint grouping will be strengthened on the border of the european union and belarus belarus and ukraine but now there will be no extraordinary action this is a provocation a rocket fell and suddenly something quickly began to be done everything will be according to plan nor will there be emergency arm supply to minsk from moscow exposing it rear even though the provocation wa committed against a member of the union state there is a plan for the rearmament of belarus there is a plan for training pilot who will fly aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapon iskanders and s s are being transferred to belarus solonnikov said these plan exist just this arrival once again confirms that they need to be implemented that s another additional argument if you will kiev confirmed to u today that we are right and we need to follow this course because today the ukrainian regime is a handshake regime that is fully blessed with all action by the united state and should be blessed with europe a well europe ha nothing to say against those supported by the u the pentagon say where the bit is why doe ukraine have so many s air defense system after all it wa the air defense point that were the first target at the very beginning of the special operation it turn out that this is an echo of the ussr ukraine had the most powerful air defense system in the soviet union after russia there were at least anti aircraft missile regiment of s alone explains vladislav shurygin a military expert and member of the izborsk club yes since february russian troop have noticeably thinned out the order of battle now kiev is forced to beg for system from the west because there are fewer and fewer of it own and a they are eliminated ukraine s combat capability ability to detect and importantly combat skill fall all of ukraine s air defense is now based on american information shurygin said they receive information from radar on american awakes aircraft this information is directly transmitted to the ukrainian command and they are already sent to the division there can be both glitch and error within this transmission therefore the result are a follows you can t believe ukrainian whining meanwhile the deficit of combat calculation is confirmed even by the head of the main intelligence directorate of ukraine budanov he said that ukraine is not able to achieve significant success in the conflict with russia the ukrainian army doe not have enough resource to advance kiev is once again looking forward to new arm shipment i would trust any statement of budanov with about zero percent vladislav shurygin note i would very much like to convince myself that ukraine no longer ha any strength to fight but i am well aware that both the army command and the intelligence are doing everything to misinform u the expert compare these statement with recent story about the fact that kharkiv is defended by old theroboronovtsy and divchins at checkpoint in fact this is not true in any way i think ukraine ha the strength to try to attack shurygin said at the same time he agrees kiev is no longer able to change the situation strategically but they can strike and advance in place sometimes even pretend to be victory we shouldn t relax in this case they can be active for a while and i think it s not one month or two the conflict ha just entered the stage of maximum tension i think the outcome of the winter campaign will be decided in january and it s going to have a very big impact for the next three to five month if this campaign is unsuccessful for ukraine we will have the prospect that by the middle or end of next year ukraine will find itself in a very difficult catastrophic situation if they can hold on and even inflict some defeat on u then this campaign will drag on even more in the area of the saratov city of engels the russian air defense system again worked another object wa shot down which wa launched a it is believed from the territory of ukraine the governor of the region roman busargin wrote in his telegram channel that they shot down a drone fragment from which damaged a car a garage and a fence of a private house and also broke a window on the balcony according to the head of the region there were no victim the evacuation of child s institution wa not carried out in mikhail antonov s program on radio komsomolskaya pravda we discussed the problem of long range ukrainian drone which are not the first time they reach the volga city where serious combat aviation of the russian air force is based with the military observer of ta retired colonel viktor litovkin and what s up there again it seems that the strizh drone is still of soviet production the ukrainian banderites it seems have already shot at the airfield in engels it wa a scout or he wa walking with ammunition most likely it wa a reconnaissance aircraft converted into a cruise missile initially it wa a reconnaissance aircraft that should fly with a radius of up to a thousand kilometer photograph the target and return back dropping cassette with photographic film but here we see that the ukrainian with the help of their curator were able to convert these jet uavs into attack drone and such a drone can be controlled remotely it s not manageable it lay down the program of flight and return he had to get to engels by autopilot but there wa knocked out by our air defense but why didn t the air defense land it earlier we do not have an air defense system at every step it is not surprising that it can pa through area where there are no continuous barrier from the air defense system of course there is a similar thing around large city defense economic facility and at the front for example the same strizh drone tu flew to croatia this spring and flew there through nato country and no one not only did not notice him but also did not shoot him down there is nothing surprising in this and there is nothing to reproach our military for maybe it s time for u to lift airship you can raise it but what s the point well they will detect the flight of the drone and then in kharkiv more than a hundred such drone were produced at the aircraft factory if we have not yet discovered the ukrainian warehouse where these uavs are located if we have not destroyed this aircraft plant yet they will probably continue to arrive the swift have arrived and where have the bayraktars gone so they don t fly that far at kilometer maximum strizh is a long range product of the soviet model turkish bayraktars can not fly from ukraine to any engels and pantsir s deal with bayraktars for once only it is necessary to carry out enhanced combat duty read also in ukraine soviet drone are being re equipped with american navigation system for strike on russia according to a number of military expert the engels wa attacked by the soviet tu strizh drone more after it became known that a ukrainian missile of the s anti aircraft complex fell on the territory of belarus i contacted my military and civilian source correspondent of various news agency that are investigating this emergency by phone so far from their word the working version look like this the flight of the s missile from the territory of ukraine wa recorded at about am apparently the wreckage of the rocket fell in the ivanovo district of the brest region near the agro town of gorbakh the wreckage ha already established the type and brand of the missile this is the product b r of the s p complex here are her passport detail weight kg length m diameter m warhead weight kg control radio command there is a homing head it ha already been established with a high degree of probability that the rocket will be launched the th anti aircraft missile regiment of the armed force of ukraine this unit which is stationed in the village of kamianka bugska lviv region is armed with s p missile the regiment took up combat duty relatively recently on january of this year but had already managed to distinguish itself when it had recently smeared the same missile in poland knocking out a tractor and hitting two civilian the belarusian military agree that ukrainian inept people tried to counteract the massive russian missile raid on thursday but again messed something up by the way the th regiment cover lviv and our kalibr hit it military industrial facility well from lviv to the ivanovo district in the brest region is about kilometer for a rocket that fly at a speed of meter per second such a misfire is a trifle the ministry of defense reported that the ukrainian s missile wa shot down by the air defense of belarus since february the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country russian president vladimir putin announced the conduct of the cvo in his public video message calling the main goal of the special military operation the protection of civilian of the donetsk and lugansk people s republic from genocide by the armed force of ukraine the website kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november the air defense of belarus shot down a ukrainian missile the incident is now being investigated observer of the kp ru viktor baranets suggested that the missile could be launched by the same regiment of the armed force of ukraine that had previously missed poland in the city of engels saratov region air defense system shot down a ukrainian drone a a result of the incident there is damage to various object there are no injury among local resident and military personnel the ministry of defense of russia reported the destruction of control point of the armed force of ukraine in kherson also precision missile strike eliminated the headquarters of ukrainian nationalist in a number of other settlement listen a well how ha changed the global economy the incident with the ukrainian missile which wa shot down over the belarusian territory is quite natural given kiev s aggressive rhetoric against belarus this opinion wa expressed on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda by the belarusian political scientist chairman of the board of the belarusian society knowledge vadim gigin this is certainly an egregious case he said and in reality it doe not matter much whether it is an accident or a deliberate provocation because on the part of the kiev regime we have recently heard aggressive rhetoric which is on the rise near the belarusian border a large group of troop controlled by kiev is concentrated including missile launcher deployed this is not the first time we have shot down ukrainian missile we remember the case with tochka u and with unmanned aerial vehicle that were destroyed by the belarusian air defense kiev openly talk about the goal that are considered on the territory of the republic of belarus a part of the armed force of ukraine there is an illegal armed formation formed from belarusian citizen who fled to the territory of ukraine according to vadim gigin kiev s aggressive rhetoric against belarus took place even before february of this year various neo nazi and extremist group found refuge in ukraine set up camp and training center there it is not so much the reason that happened on december that is important but the possible response to such a provocation the belarusian expert continues the coordinated action of the air defense system border guard the endurance shown by our fighter on the border all this can deter the kiev regime from further provocative action but we must understand that no one is protected from such accidental incident in quotation mark because there are troop at the border these troop are on the platoon they are constantly being stirred up by nationalist nazi propaganda we see and hear it all the time our border guard tell how the theroboronians on the other side go to the border point weapon in our direction in such an environment serious incident can continue to occur but the tough and rapid rebuff from all national security system show our readiness if necessary to repel such attempt on the territory of belarus but still i would like and this is the most important thing to prevent them at an early stage why doe ukraine arrange such provocation there are several version and each of them is worse than the other first kiev wa simply probing the limit of what is permissible how far and how hard you can hit so you don t get back so far alexander lukashenko ha not spoken out on this matter but without a doubt the answer will be we know the father in the meantime kiev is trying in every possible way to hush up this incident and he vow to conduct a big investigation and punish all those responsible second version belarus is the entry point for nato into the russian ukrainian conflict ukraine or rather it foreign master provoke minsk to retaliate in order to draw it into hostility and under this pretext they may try to achieve direct nato intervention in the conflict so a lot now depends on the decision of alexander lukashenko listen a well how ha changed the global economy it s hard to believe the snow maiden pictured come out to the fighter and behind them is santa claus in festive vestment yes yes

who find themselves in a difficult life situation over the past four year the project fulfilled wish of child and the elderly for a total amount of over million ruble last night in odessa monument to the founder of odessa popularly called a monument to catherine ii and the brilliant russian commander who for his entire military career did not lose a single battle alexander vasilyevich suvorov were demolished demolished a befits a thief at night secretly so that the townspeople in the morning would simply accept it a an already established fact pushing to the monument not only special equipment and worker but mass police force that literally cordoned off the place of implementation of the legalized state ukrainian barbarism in order to a the modern ukrainian nazi in power say finally sever all tie with the russian world and with russia the current moral freak who by the will of fate and the west have ascended to the leadership of ukraine which ha become a non country are hardly able due to the squalor of their intellect to realize that by such action they are not so much breaking with russia a betraying ukraine itself let me remind you that the monument to the founder of odessa wa already demolished by the bolshevik in when many monument and even entire architectural complex in russia went into oblivion after the use of explosive and scrap but it wa a barbarism of the moment after getting rid of a it wa believed from the unjust system that oppressed all the people of the empire much and not only material of the heritage wa later restored partly by the way by the communist themselves similarly the monument to catherine ii in odessa wa restored in because in that ukraine they realized that it wa impossible to rewrite history and probably because it s just beautiful and is a cultural treasure and attraction by the way the monument wa then restored by the ukrainian themselves without any interference from russia or the russian the sponsor wa the odessa businessman that is why the demolition of the monument wa a betrayal of the ukraine that existed not only before but also after gaining independence independence but according to the same logic after the monument in odessa it should be the turn of the main symbol of kiev itself in the whole world the monument to bohdan khmelnitsky on sophia square in the capital of ukraine after all this monument wa once decorated with tablet with inscription to bogdan khmelnitsky a single indivisible russia and will under the tsar of the eastern orthodox and the hetman himself after all it wa he who led the self styled people to the hand of the same catherine yes he hesitated along with the line of the gentry tried to sell his service to one side or the other but when it wa just a question of survival he made a completely unambiguous choice and after all he did not just agree for several year together with the ukrainian gentry he literally begged the empress to take these land and the population under his hand according to the logic of the current ukrainian if the traitor hetman mazepa became a hero then the hero hetman khmelnytsky simply must turn into a traitor and a zradnik and his place on sophia square should be taken by mazepa preferably with the order of juda around his neck and there is no place in today s ukraine for monument to such people all these zelenskys yermaks podolyaks arrester shmyli and other understatement in term of the scale of the personality are simply not able to appreciate the greatness of real historical figure probably the only thing that they can feel for those to whom the monument is erected is the hatred and envy of small evil soul for the truly great and they are also afraid because the monument remind of the true greatness of the country in which the great city wa once founded and lived an enviable life to whom the current government ha prepared the fate of an ordinary multi storey farm no the current government could not put up with such monument in any way it s a if lilliputian lived next to a monument to gulliver which from generation to generation would raise a number of uncomfortable question from others and there and to other hero the turn will come to kozhedub kovpak cat to hundred of real hero it will definitely come because once you have stepped on the path of betrayal of yourself and your history it is impossible to stop and there will only be a further dive deeper and deeper a for these monument they will definitely be restored to their historical site when odessa will again become a russian city read also in odessa a monument to the commander alexander suvorov wa demolished also in the city the monument to empress catherine ii is being dismantled more in odessa they began to dismantle the monument to catherine i the square where the monument is installed is blocked more the work of the parliamentary coordination group on the issue of special military operation svo is extremely important it will require constant and long term attention of it participant russian defense minister sergei shoigu said on wednesday at the first meeting of the parliamentary coordination group on the cbo i understand that

department noted that the idea of creating this coordination group arose almost simultaneously with the beginning of partial mobilization to support serviceman and their family the president supported this initiative we have completed mobilization partial mobilization there were a lot of difficulty a lot of problem here i cannot but say that we managed to solve most of the problem and issue quite

correspondent the working group is headed by first deputy speaker of the federation council secretary of the general council of united russia andrei turchak igor nazaruk deputy head of the belarusian

become a place for negotiation and resolution of serious conflict she is ready to act in this capacity now this wa confirmed by representative of the vatican but given the fact that earlier the white house stated that minsk is guilty of allowing moscow to use it territory to deploy russian force and made it possible to hold the svo in ukraine it is unlikely that the belarusian capital or other city of this wonderful country will be chosen a a platform for achieving peace they are afraid of the pole and swamp there the dismantling of the monument to the russian empress catherine ii wa still

musician dramatic actor professional artist circus performer and vocal performer it can be considered that the russian ministry of defense decided to revive time tested tradition it is worth recalling that during the great patriotic war in the soviet union about two thousand front line brigade were formed they undoubtedly made a certain contribution to our common victory over german fascism if you recall the footage of such film a actress father of a soldier the pig and the shepherd a well a newsreel of those year it becomes obvious the artist of the front brigade were always waiting on the front line singer musician artist of all genre raised the mood of fighter and fighting spirit these creative and fearless people inspired the personnel song performed by shulzhenko ruslanova gave strength to those who tomorrow had to go on the attack now during the period of a special military operation all this is no le relevant it s actually in demand it is no coincidence that for the first time in the history of the modern armed force of russia two front line creative brigade have been formed after the announcement of partial mobilization i received a summons i arrived at the military recruitment office then within hour he left for a military unit yevgeny pavlov an actor of the sovremennik theater recalled his journey then i had a rather intense mobilization fee and i m really

say elena antalya turkey the ice cream man grappled with how much the war in ukraine had changed his neighborhood so many russian had moved to antalya a resort city in southern turkey that local family were being priced out of their home russian co working space hair salon and other business were using sign in russian to advertise their service and russian clearly outnumbered turk in the park where the ice cream vendor worked pushing their child on the playground swing doing video conference with faraway place from the park bench and thankfully buying lot of ice cream it is a if one morning we woke up and we no longer heard any turkish word it s all russian said the vendor kaan devran ozturk turk feel like stranger in their own country russia s invasion of ukraine ha sent huge number of people fleeing from both country and ten of thousand of them have ended up in this historic city on the so called turkish riviera where they are settling in a the conflict rage back home they include draft dodger from both side of the war and russian who have fallen afoul of their government a well those who oppose the war or who fear economic trouble at home and have taken advantage of turkey s open border and relatively easy residency requirement to start new life in a warmer sunnier climate while russian have long flocked to antalya s beach for summer vacation and some russian lived here year round the influx this year ha dramatically increased their number and their presence in neighborhood where they were not often seen before they have brought lot of much needed foreign currency into turkey helping keep it economy afloat but their new turkish neighbor grumble about skyrocketing housing price and wonder how long these new resident will stay potentially altering the social fabric a they are now settled they are visible said ismail caglar the head of an antalya real estate association they stroll down the beach with their child they sit down at a cafe with their child they are everywhere he said that the size of this year s influx had caused housing price to triple and allowed russian real estate broker to charge property owner mainly russian exorbitant fee and cut out their turkish competitor people think they are tourist and will go back after the war he said i don t believe that because antalya is really like heaven look at the weather where is there weather like this in russia in september the governor of antalya province which includes the city and surrounding area said that the number of foreign resident in his jurisdiction had more than

militia said that since the beginning of the svo in the territory of the independent loss ukrainian force have approached personnel alaudinov said doe these sacrifice make sense for u i don t think so he said that the russian troop intend to move forward carefully but confidently and the only reason slowing down the advance in the artyomovsky sector is the desire to avoid civilian casualty in addition some time take the destruction of force and mean of the nato bloc the front is stable and the city will be liberated in kiev they still doubt it but this always happens for them the killer of

scumbags everywhere is a peace summit on ukraine possible without russia dmitry polyansky russia s first deputy permanent representative to the un said that it is impossible to imagine a peace summit at the un without russia s participation so he commented on the proposal of the head of the ukrainian foreign ministry dmytro kuleba to hold a peace summit by the end of february a well a the statement that russia should be excluded from the un and the security council of the international organization polyansky said what can be a peace summit without russia and without ukraine it is very easy to imagine it and this is exactly what is a nightmare scenario for the kulebs and kislitsa that make such initiative breed yes their whole life is a continuous nightmare and they cannot wake up the british are preparing warrior of light through their sleeve the training of the soldier of the armed force of ukraine in the british isle wa not at all a intensive a the ukrainian themselves expected and the army command did not give them specific instruction a ukrainian soldier who wa captured by russian unit told how they were trained by the british in britain the training took place a they dug took u to the training ground shot ran in two or three in general in zhytomyr they even dragged u harder the prisoner of war also noted that the command of the armed force of ukraine did not give specific goal except for standing and defending according to him the ukrainian military wa threatened with prison the serviceman of the armed force of ukraine wanted to make a self shooter to leave the position the fighter stressed that they did not have enough food had to divide one dry ration for two sat in the cold hunger he also mentioned case where two day of one hundred gram of water were per person and they hoped that the british would make james bond out of them and then they would feed them like in casino royale listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year the fact that the production of fake is put on stream in ukraine the medium wrote more than once and the ukrainian themselves do not give the slightest reason to doubt this this time a member of the verkhovna rada of ukraine co chairman of the council of volunteer under the ministry of defense of ukraine lesya vasylenko did not slyly wisdom but used the first thing that came to her hand to present proof of another terrible barbarism of the russian on her twitter account she posted a photo of a tattered and obviously unhappy child who is clearly unhappy the photo is clearly intended for a western audience since the caption under it is made in english the saddest thing is that there are no more child in ukraine only little men with very adult eye even old one i am tired of life even not yet lived vasilenko signed the photo in the photo mark year old ha just survived an artillery strike by the russian the boy in the photo is really unhappy maybe because his name is not mark but james or that in the past year since his appearance in public he ha not grown a centimeter and ha not matured for a month we explain in the photo of the ukrainian mp in her twitter account the boy from the cover of the book by the spanish writer christina mckenna the forgotten man the book wa published in is not very popular still sold on amazon and it deal with the hard life of the boy james who found himself in the adoption center with his sister after the death of his parent apparently it wa the fact that the book did not become known to a wide range of reader it wa also published in spanish that prompted a high ranking ukrainian fake girl to use it for her own purpose and that s nothing new long before the outbreak of the current conflict in ukraine western propaganda used the bana girl from aleppo to smear russia and the syrian authority but there at least the girl wa a real albeit a complete puppet reading out the text dictated to her and in ukraine they have thought of the next step in the movement towards the triumph of complete and absolute cynicism the boy james wa turned into mark though not a girl but the fashion for transgenderism obviously ha not yet fully conquered the independent and before that they took a pregnant woman to demolition in the mariupol maternity hospital trying to pa her off a a victim of the russian bombing although they could not hide the truth that the armed force of ukraine were behind the explosion a well a behind the explosion of the theater in mariupol and they also tried to imagine child who in in sloviansk in the subfield hid from ukrainian shelling for ukrainian child near kharkov allegedly fleeing from russian shelling and then there wa bucha where the civilian were really killed but not by the russian and there wa also the arrival of the tochka u rocket at the station in kramatorsk and the other day there wa shelling of kherson with a large number of victim among civilian moreover for the blow the russian tried to pa off the arrival of the mirs highmars which the armed force of the russian federation did not have somehow everything is already quite boring and primitive absolutely no fiction actually why try if for the west it will already come down they are happy to eat any shit about russia they will also smack with pleasure the fact that grigory kubatyan a frequent guest of the joint program of radio kp and the russian geographical society club of famous traveler went to the svo zone we learned from the telegram channel of his fellow writer zakhar prilepin in early autumn grigory kubatyan an excellent journalist writer military officer who covered among other thing the event in syria a traveler who seemed to explore the whole world a real adventurer we laughed that grisha is the embodied hero of jack london left a a volunteer for donbas zakhar said we all found out only yesterday when gregory finally had time to write about it after being wounded and he added in another post listing all the adventure of the russian traveler see screenshot aw director well put aside for a moment your next leviathan about russian drunkenness here s the finished story do hollywood what you re worth the director haven t responded yet but radio kp responded where grigory came a soon a he wa discharged from the hospital gregory it turn out that you have returned from the most extreme journey in your life i did not perceive it a a journey or an adventure i had to work in donbas a a military officer and then i realized that i had to take part in these event more closely protect our people protect my country fight nazism the desire wa strengthened when partial mobilization began especially against the background of the fact that many young and healthy people began to vote and go abroad and you generally fell under the mobilization no i did not serve in the army for health reason restriction and age but sitting at home would be wrong and ugly of me i am a man with some experience of survival but why did you go to donbas through chechnya back then we weren t so active in recruiting volunteer i began to look for option and it turned out that i had friend in the akhmat battalion a former classmate of mine a platoon leader suggested come on we already have a well coordinated battle group if anything we ll help you we ll tell you and that s what happened how you were met in grozny well received in general akhmat itself is purely chechen only by a third the other third are men from other caucasian region another third are russian from other part of russia there you can meet people from karelia from chukotka from the crimea mostly from small town or village when i said that i wa from st petersburg everyone wa surprised what are you doing here they say that in st petersburg it wa possible to sit and not go what drove your fellow volunteer different motif some just like me go for patriotic reason the other part is practical you re talking about money when i came to akhmat there wa still no certainty about the money there were a lot of guy who fell under partial mobilization but did not know to which part they would be sent to what condition and akhmat is already so to speak a brand there are no problem with equipment and you are under the direct supervision of the chechen leadership age is also different mostly men but you can find such strong caucasian grandfather with beard serious solid who have already fought in all war starting with the afghan one but there were of course pioneer like me without experience at all in general a cross section of such a society exactly you meet a lot of different people with different motif but in general in the army all this is leveling off everyone get the same goal and objective and in general you become no matter how pathetic it may sound brother this appeal is purely army brother brother it is quite natural you divide everything equally and you share adversity too and food and you help each other and drag each other if necessary if suddenly someone is wounded you need to pull them off the battlefield even at the risk of his own life i wa comfortable psychologically although at first i expected that i would find myself in an aggressive alien environment he wa afraid to face half dedovshchina in relation to non serving however the attitude turned out to be the most friendly sympathetic everyone helped everyone tried a hard a they could you remember your first combat mission of course we had a rotation a week you are in the location of the unit a week on a combat mission and in a month i had two fight on the second one i wa hurt the first way out wa that we were sitting in an ambush they were just in position in case of a possible breakthrough of the enemy to hit him in the flank the fighting wa going on side by side mostly there were artillery and mortar duel drone flew a very sneaky thing he see you day and night and can drop a grenade and the second combat it wa a breakthrough already a real fight i ve only seen this before in a movie about stalingrad everything explodes around and you drive somewhere at random by running from cover to cover and sniper are working on you then somehow everyone gathered came to their sen understood what to do a lot of problem were caused by the enemy tank it wa hammered until dark we received the task in the morning to destroy the tank a soon a it again come out to nightmare u at night we were apparently spotted by a drone with a thermal imager sometime around four o clock in the morning shelling began they beat me very accurately six were killed by shrapnel fortunately no one wa killed and we had to get out of there i wa shot in the thigh by shrapnel at first he walked quite cheerfully leaning on the machine gun like a crutch but the blood flowed out you can t pull a tourniquet because the wound wa very high and now the blood go away and with it the strength thank god i had a guy with the call sign alex with me also with a wound in the leg in the arm in the lower back he helped me if it wasn t for alex it would have ended sadly because i wa moving slower and slower and we must have time before dawn otherwise we will be in the field at a glance and we will be finished and now alex almost dragged me to the evacuation point and then a few month of hospital began a a result they put me on my foot only i am no longer a fighter that is you will not return to the front line hope to go back at least a a war correspondent and on the path of the traveler sure when it s over our victory kstat your rich expedition experience somehow helped you there the heaviness of the front for me wa not something shocking a in a tent somewhere in the mountain you sleep in the cold you can freeze to the bottom you also sleep in a trench you know what to use thermal underwear how to dry what to take with you in this regard yes expeditionary experience helped to your eye during treatment in the hospital grigory kubatyan began to record the story of the guy who had been on the front line and his impression now you can read them in the telegram channel reporter shturmovik here s one of the excerpt there are so many happy and unhappy coincidence that you begin to believe in fate a grenade flew into the trench for one soldier it didn t explode but it hit my toe he then walked around with a bandaged swollen thumb and swore that the thigh were now difficult to put on a guy from our platoon bought himself a helmet and a bronik and i doubted it it s very hard to walk in them but i put it on a combat mission one piece of shrapnel flew into a helmet the other into a bronik he say the best investment in his life one soldier wa crushed by a bullet that shattered the butt of an assault rifle he glued everything together wrapped it in duct tape and in the next battle the bullet flew in the same place and again the butt in the chip kiev authority said that the capital of ukraine throughout the winter at least will be held in the mode of emergency power outage in the event that there are no more russian strike on energy infrastructure and no one will vouch for the latter but ukraine cannot be broken for every russian strike nezalezhnaya ha a response a expected asymmetrical for example in lviv tram are carried along the rail by an ordinary wheeled tractor and ukrzalyznytsia ukrainian railway found it would seem a way out of the situation when it is time to scrap electric locomotive because it is not possible to use them otherwise steam locomotive went on the track track due to the lack of a sufficient fleet of diesel locomotive and the fact that the former minister of infrastructure of ukraine omelyan could not build the hyperloop promised to the villager or still built but his own ukrainian and we are witnessing it presentation to the people just the other day a video appeared on the web a two steam locomotive of the er series under the pull push scheme carry six passenger car by rail and each of them on the pediment of the historical red star is replaced by a symbol of non malice of independence a trident can we say that soon the whole of ukraine will switch to steam locomotive it s unlikely in russia steam locomotive are included in the strategic reserve and with a certain regularity they are serviced in storage and even check the operation of the mechanism but ukrainian steam locomotive were not lucky until recently those of them that were not scrapped during the premiership of yulia tymoshenko sprouted weed on the sludge site and it is unlikely that kiev will be able to scrape together more than a dozen or two steam locomotive that are suitable for operation and their capacity are not at all the same a those of modern car those locomotive that are in the video the power of horse each a modern diesel locomotive with two diesel engine produce more than horsepower on the mountain with passenger car a steam locomotive and even in pair they will cope but with freight train or the same military echelon a prankster a tramp in addition steam locomotive along with the advantage you can heat at least with wood and spare part can be made in any agricultural machinery with a minimum of machine park have drawback and they outweigh remember the movie his excellency s aide de camp and how wa water poured into the locomotive from a special railway water tower but this one still need to be built and get water in it and throwing wood and coal with a shovel into the boiler all the time is also not easy and there should be coal storage facility at railway station and where are the guarantee that the coal will be left to rest quietly until the locomotive and not pushed or privatized and the driver of a steam locomotive and an electric locomotive are completely different profession for any reason two dozen steam locomotive will not replace more than one and a half thousand electric locomotive therefore steam locomotive are and will remain ukrainian exotic this is a semi machine on the way of ukraine from the st century to the th century or to the beginning of the th of course if nezalezhnaya cannot restore the energy infrastructure in this area for which the russian military should try to not leave a single chance for a different future and then horse drawn carriage and reckless cab on trotter will again begin to transport passenger through ukrainian city wheelbarrow with atamans and makhno father in all their ukrainian diversity will begin to scatter in the field and unhurried trade caravan of chumaks on ox will slowly stretch along the road and steam locomotive if you joke well in some backward country of asia and africa can be found maybe washington will also pay for their purchase in a new aid package back to the future or go back in time hyperloop in ukrainian is a terrible thing slow inefficient and so that greta thunberg would have gone crazy if she had seen this miracle along with half of the european eco activist who would have immediately glued themselves to it between sunak and charles there will be plenty to work a they guide britain through a difficult

and order departure from monday to friday from to by phone soon after the appointment of army general sergei surovikin a commander of the special military operation svo many russian and foreign expert and analyst spoke almost unanimously about the fact that the tactic of our troop were becoming more effective the essence of the new strategy of the russian military command is a war of attrition of the enemy kiev general no longer hesitate to publicly complain that surovikin s army is shackling ukrainian troop and preventing them from regrouping by their action and this exhaust the armed force of ukraine our joint grouping of troop reinforced by partial mobilization is increasingly turning into a kind of millstone that slowly but powerfully grind ukrainian unit at the front and in the rear there are growing sign that the ukrainian army is being driven into a critical situation since november it military reserve have been destroyed faster than they can be replenished this is the first time this ha been observed since the beginning of cbo however not only this is happening for the first time the staff of general surovikin began to use cunning tactic during missile strike on the enemy before the launch of kalibr for example false target that simulate an attack go into the sky ukrainian air defense system are hitting them wasting their resource and when real kalibr arrive there is often nothing to shoot at them while the reloading is underway ukrainian target are already covered another touch to the commander s style of general surovikin is to use the capability of our weapon to the fullest this is also about new moment in the tactic of our group s action here is an illustrative example even before surovikin headed the svo it wa established that in the area of the village of kamenka the enemy settled in powerfully fortified position even our artillery and air strike did not help to smoke out the enemy from under the reinforced concrete shelter the offensive of our unit in this direction trampled on the spot and then surovikin ordered to inflict maximum damage to the enemy to strike with a heavy flamethrower system tos a solntsepek powerful thermobaric ammunition caused significant damage to the position of the ukrainian military and the way to the offensive wa open the great merit of surovikin in changing the course of the special operation is recognized by western and ukrainian military expert and the medium the british edition of the telegraph for example wrote about it this way russian military commander surovikin ha stabilized russia s front line in ukraine since coming to power in october and brought discipline to the kremlin army the general demonstrates a high capacity for organization and cruelty ukrainian military expert oleg starikov on the air of the internet channel yes it is so said surovikin seized the initiative and grind our reserve they dragged u into a war of attrition ukraine wa moving away from it for all nine month of the war we used mobile defense when the enemy advance we sit and defend ourselves in three echelon the first second and third defensive echelon if you have already surrounded go to the second now unfortunately we have moved away from that they dragged u in it turn out that bakhmut is now devouring all our resource all the resource that were prepared for the plan of the general staff which we said a counteroffensive operation wa possible they are thrown there and grinded this is russia this is their general staff general surovikin seized the initiative and we succumbed to that surovikin induced discipline and the troop began to perform the task that their commander set and we didn t get it the wall street journal who visited ukraine report that some of the most powerful artillery system that the west ha transferred to ukraine have long been out of the battlefield due to complex maintenance procedure and quarrel between european ally the biggest problem are experienced by heavy artillery in some case the complexity of weapon or the secrecy of technology force maintenance and repair in nato country according to ukrainian and western military official in the event of a breakdown of the german panzerhaubitze self propelled gun the french caesar self propelled gun or the american m gun in about of case the service will take place outside ukraine now le than half of the german pzh self propelled artillery gun transferred to ukraine are on the battlefield and the repair of broken one ha been carried out in lithuania for a long time and back in november the german magazine der spiegel reported that due to planning error there were not enough spare part to repair these self propelled gun and therefore it wa necessary to disassemble one of the lithuanian one the apu fire about round of shell per day from the pzh instead of the recommended which cause severe wear and tear on the gun system and at the same time lead to zero and the accuracy of fire on the russian the u s and britain maintain the weapon they have transferred to ukraine in poland near the ukrainian border then in november the new york time wrote referring to representative of the u department of defense that a third of the approximately western made howitzer transferred to ukraine could fail at any time especially after the shelling from the russian side the wall street journal in it article mention the piquant moment it turn out that poland refused to allow germany to create a service center for the repair of weapon on it territory instead warsaw demanded that german manufacturer disclose the technology to a polish state owned company that would perform the repair but berlin disagreed after bickering with the pole germany made the same request to slovakia which agreed to host a service center what doe all this mean the fact that the west is ready to wage a protracted war with u with the hand of ukrainian and we have to be ready for that that time vladimir

those who hosted these displaced people in their home are desperate about what will happen on christmas and new year s day daniel say they want their home back and rightly so she gave an example when the lady of the house went down to the kitchen and felt like a stranger because everyone wa talking on the phone and behaving like a master adis sehi a specialist at the labour right charity centre say everyone is alarmed by the rising cost of living so it s silly to be angry because people don t want to host other family when they can barely support their own there is no need to be angry but it is also not very reasonable to accept anyone with open arm andriy marochko an officer of the people s militia of the lpr said that the ukrainian command is transferring additional force to the matchmaking direction in the donbas marochko explained this by the large loss of the armed force of ukraine and the ineffectiveness of fire weapon earlier it wa reported that the command of the armed force of ukraine intends to cut the communication between the city of svatovo and starobilsk in the lpr for which it doe not take into account loss even in elite unit it is characteristic that report began to come from the central region of ukraine that the armed force of ukraine began to be taken directly from club bar and restaurant and with bankova they didn t try the sixth president of ukraine in his congratulation of citizen on christmas said that we are not waiting for a miracle but we create it ourselves reader of the german edition of die welt were amazed at such self confidence one commenter wa amazed wow now zelensky think that he can work miracle isn t that crazy another belief but he himself realizes that only a miracle will bring them victory it is a pity that thousand of ukrainian will die before this happens a third added people who consider themselves miracle worker are overflowing with mental asylum in any country in the world but in some place there are still free place for new customer chinese foreign minister wang yi said that sino russian relation are strong a a monolith and they do not change under the influence of unstable international conjuncture wang yi stressed these relation are not subject to interference and provocation according to the chinese foreign minister cooperation between beijing and moscow is not antagonistic and is not aimed at any third party he said china and russia firmly oppose hegemony and the new cold war yes we have to repeat this for those who do not understand the chinese language well a well a the language of the mind felipe vi king of spain said in a christmas address to the nation that the conflict in the independent had provoked an energy crisis in his country with the most serious consequence for industry trade and transport the word of the monarch are reported by the publication el pais the conflict in ukraine had a profound impact on the economy this wa reflected in higher price for food heating electricity or gasoline there are family who cannot cope with this situation for a long time and need the constant support of the authority to mitigate it economic and social consequence felipe vi urged not to ignore the great concern and uncertainty that this situation generates and this is quite simple to do stop sending weapon to kiev and block such decision at the eu level and your difficulty will end could be on the website of the national commission for state regulation in the field of energy and utility of ukraine information appeared in ukraine at least twice in they plan to raise tariff for cold water and wastewater disposal service the first increase is planned from january and the second from july in the list of region where the tariff will be increased only mykolaiv and kharkiv region are absent a well a the part of the kherson region controlled by the ukrainian authority the new tariff are due to be approved on december well a great new year s gift wa made to the population by those who are going to soon return to the border of you would deal with the water first returnees a terrorist organization banned in russia listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year ukraine again struck a drone at a russian strategic facility according to the russian defense ministry the aircraft wa shot down during approach to the engels airfield in the saratov region three soldier died from it wreckage a similar thing happened on december then kiev also tried to hit the diaghilevo airfield near ryazan and the same engels in both case the drone were also shot down but in ryazan a now in engels three died from the wreckage what kind of model of drone wa used is not officially reported but perhaps these were the same jet reconnaissance target tu swift these are still soviet made device how could they overcome air defense system and fly hundred of kilometer deep into russian territory how to protect yourself from attack of these device in the future we talked about this with military expert it wa reconnaissance by combat an attempt to check what conclusion the russian defense complex made after the first drone strike military expert head of the center for the study of military applied problem alexander zhilin said on komsomolskaya pravda radio after all this drone arrived on the same route a the first time and this is kilometer across the country apparently they were walking at a very low altitude said military expert vasily dandykin it should be remembered that the same swift in march fell having spent fuel in croatia and the vaunted nato air defense did not detect it either we now have the main air defense force now covering our unit that are at the front but what happened showed that air defense system should be placed on different frontier and it should be not only pantsirs and torah but also system such a buk during the exercise our air defense destroyed such target quite calmly both moscow and the so called central industrial district are quite tightly closed with air defense and missile defense system said kp ru military expert colonel viktor baranets baranets also belief that the soviet strizh rocket target in ukraine have been modernized at the same time in his opinion this modernization could not have taken place without the participation of western special service otherwise the swift would not have been able to overcome such distance look when the soviet union collapsed ukraine got a large number of swift rocket target about piece in warehouse they were able to fly from a force of kilometer they were launched over the test site to shoot them down during the exercise say viktor nikolaevich if the german wa not hit the self liquidator wa activated but how did it manage to adapt the swift to today s fighting you need honor three factor say our military observer firstly the school of aircraft designer ha been preserved in ukraine there is a whole antonov bureau secondly they have an enterprise motor sich capable of supplying these target with more powerful engine and thirdly the british and american taught ukrainian to put in these swift a new electronic stuffing that allows them to fly under the control of gps such technology have existed for a long time our kalibrs act in exactly the same way they lay detailed map with the terrain and they fly to the target a if they were at home if earlier ukraine could launch missile for kilometer then with the help of these british and american technology they were able to hit a thousand kilometer baranets state remember in march the same swift collapsed in the zagreb area our reference the length of the swift is m weight ton these jet target made their first flight in they were intended for reconnaissance at a distance of several hundred kilometer swift wa equipped with photo and infrared camera flew along a given route data transmission by radio wa not supposed after landing the film had to be picked up and developed in such device were produced at the kharkov aircraft plant in the tu wa removed from service but in it wa returned to the troop the armed force of ukraine used it for reconnaissance over the territory of the dpr and lpr at the same time it wa decided to modernize them the installation of a modern control and navigation system now the use of the tu a a photo reconnaissance aircraft is no longer relevant because it is used to open the air defense system a well a a projectile aircraft listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year in the russian expert environment discussion about the struggle for power in today s ukraine do not cease with a periodicity of once a week at least on tv screen or on the air of youtube channel another expert appears who say that either the american are about to change zelensky to zaluzhny or that zelensky will remove the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine zaluzhny from day to day to eliminate the threat to himself a president in reality these conversation are most like a transfusion from empty to empty there are no prerequisite for either the first or the second now no matter how we feel about zelensky and he fully deserved all the nickname that are given to him and there is really nowhere to put stigma on him he and his team built such a rigid vertical of power that doe not exist anywhere else in the world now neither among the democracy nor among the so called dictatorial regime any political opposition ha been completely destroyed in the country some party are banned even formally and the rest compete in expressing loyalty to the existing regime all medium outlet that could criticize one or another step of the head of state and his team have been eliminated literature that go beyond ideological blinder is prohibited the constant ideological pumping of the population ha led to the fact that people do not perceive an opinion different from the correct even from their friend and relative the practice of denunciation to the ministry of internal affair and counterintelligence agency is extremely widespread and is expanding every day in order to become unreliable it is enough for example to read a book in russian language or speak russian severe discipline in term of punishment for dissent and desertion ha been introduced in the army it come to the death penalty for those who allow themselves separatist sentiment or talk about saving a life by surrendering at the same time the head of law enforcement agency in the field of intelligence and counterintelligence internal affair body are promoted to their post and appointed personally by zelensky which mean that personal loyalty should not be discounted under these condition either a frostbitten desperate brave man can decide to rebel against zelensky or a completely stupid inadequate zaluzhny doe not belong to such character and may find himself in office not a a result of a coup but solely on the initiative of zelensky himself which is clearly not set up for that zelensky is not just satisfied with his current position he is bathed in his own popularity revel in importance taste the fruit of his involvement in the world elite and is clearly ready to perform an encore the american and the british may be pleased or dissatisfied with zelensky but he is no longer just a puppet in their clever and strained hand and retains a certain degree of freedom of action moreover he is trying to manipulate them to some extent and this first of all cause their discontent and the periodically arising desire to change him to a more obedient character but zaluzhny is unlikely to become exactly what they need and changing the awl for soap is more expensive for themselves a for the removal of zaluzhny now zelensky is quite satisfied with him how he is satisfied with the fact that at any time he can change his commander in chief to another general which he will certainly do but only when something threatens zelensky himself a head of state and it s unlikely to be just a defeat on the battlefield the reason for such a decision may be either a large scale military catastrophe for which at the moment there are no reason or election if zaluzhny join the zelensky regulated moderate opposition which a a result of such an alliance may try to become uncontrollable by the office of the president of ukraine in order to deprive zaluzhny of a significant part of his political weight but these are also not matter of the near day and in the near future the already existing contradiction will remain between zelensky and zaluzhny it would be foolish to deny them but they will not affect their interaction and the situation in ukraine and will not become insurmountable so you can build various intricate design puff up your cheek and mumble something indistinct in the manner of baba vanga the political situation in ukraine will not change from this a coup d tat in ukraine in the near future is hardly possible a well a a mild change of power and to bet on this that ukraine will be weakened and fragmented from within is the height of stupidity listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year kyiv ukraine hundred of missile and drone aimed at ukraine s energy infrastructure have left million of people without power and dozen of city without christmas light it wa no accident that the wave of attack came before the holiday and in the darkest and coldest time of year said denys shmyhal ukraine s prime minister it is important for the russian he said that christmas and new year s eve pa in darkness in ukraine with that in mind some ukrainian city decided to be inventive with their christmas decoration finding way to win back the season while not wasting precious electricity or disappointing child a holiday light blink out during the attack in the usually serene square of st sophia cathedral in kyiv the capital the authority put up what they called the christmas tree of invincibility it wa decorated with papier m ch white dove and a strip of blue and yellow light the color of the ukrainian flag powered by a diesel generator they were fitting decoration for a city where the sound of generator is now heard more than the rumble of traffic the tree of invincibility can be heard before it can be seen the war is horrible but we should not leave our child without a holiday said daria pervaya a college student who had to speak loudly to be heard above the tree s generator i do not have a holiday mood this year at all she added i am waiting for my boyfriend who is fighting ukraine celebrates christmas a a national holiday on dec for church observing the religious holiday on the western calendar like the catholic in western ukraine and on jan for church observing the eastern orthodox religious holiday this year christmas decoration are hardly visible in ukrainian city but when they are displayed they almost always have a patriotic touch people crave celebrating the holiday but say it can be justified only with ukraine in mind blue and yellow ribbon are used to create flag child s letter to soldier are put on display and christmas bunny now hold blue and yellow heart valeriy bozhenko who is working a santa claus this season at kyiv s central railway station said child most often ask him for peace with toy usually coming in second the christmas tree in ivano frankivsk a city in western ukraine is a metal frame decorated with angel patriotic slogan and the municipal emblem of town retaken from the russian by the ukrainian army the city of kropyvnytsky in central ukraine put up small christmas tree in support of the town and city that have suffered the most in the war among them the seaport city of mariupol which wa besieged and mostly destroyed and bucha a suburb of kyiv that wa the site of multiple war crime a decoration with angel in lutsk in the northwest symbolizes the soul of people who died in the war in mykolaiv a hard hit city in southern ukraine a long existing statue of st nicholas wa covered with sandbag for protection a with most statue in ukrainian city for the christmas season the local administration placed holiday light on top of the sand bag and green camouflage netting that protected the statue kharkiv s city council is displaying the traditional municipal christmas tree not on the central square but underground in a subway station where people huddle for protection during artillery strike the mayor said the city would keep this tradition from now on even after the war in khmelnytskyi in central ukraine a christmas tree decorated with blue and yellow ukrainian flag wa set on top of debris from a russian s missile in kyiv the city council also defied the russian blackout by lighting one of the city s largest ever menorah candle on the central square known a the maidan parent in the capital can also bring their child to see not only the christmas tree of invincibility but a tree that is decorated with toy snowflake and light that sparkle but only if someone pedal it bicycle generator war blackout no christmas tree oleksandr kamyshin the director of ukraine s national railway company wrote on twitter of the pedal powered tree you never guess what we invented a steady stream of people stop by with their child to pedal and light up the christmas tree ramil yaremenko a year old courier said to be honest i do not want anything for christmas a i understand how hard it is for our soldier now but he brought his child to the pedal powered tree they ran about hopping on and off the bicycle trying to light it i am happy for my child though he said adding it s important that the war doe not steal childhood a year old boy named myroslav found it hard at first to pedal fast enough to light the tree his godfather oleksandr siryk stood nearby photographing him and giving advice they both became excited when it finally worked and the tree lit up brilliantly white it is not a real holiday time in our country now there is no christmas in my soul mr siryk said but child still need it first of all we congratulate you on your inclusion in the human right council under the president of russia what are your activity in this council this is actually an advisory body that develops proposal for the president on the development of civil society and on the protection of human right this organization doe not work with citizen appeal there is the office of the commissioner for human right moskalkova where citizen appeal are dealt with but there are many representative of human right organization and not only in the hrc who work with these appeal for example tatyana georgievna merzlyakova the ombudsman of the sverdlovsk region who several time went to the special operation zone actually communicated with the fighter on the front i am on the council a a representative of the military but there is no organization behind me so i deal with citizen appeal personally a far a i have enough time and energy something can be solved we didn t have field mail now it ha appeared but there have been complaint about it work some parcel are returned they do not reach the addressee not always some thing happen through the fault of the ministry of defense i wa dealing with the case of a woman whose two parcel did not arrive there are still shortcoming in the work of the russian post because this is the first time they have encountered this now much at the post office is automated i put a tick in the wrong place and that s it the parcel is returned now they are really working on these problem the connection of relative with fighter is very important the family of a career soldier understands perfectly well that if a husband father or son doe not get in touch for a month this is normal this happens to a person serving and when people are civilian a month ago their son worked in a factory and now he is a soldier and he doe not get in touch for two week people are already worried in the zone of the special operation there are place where the connection doe not catch or where it is forbidden to go on the air because immediately the enemy will strike at the cellular signal therefore i would urge relative not to try to make your son or husband constantly call you sometimes a call from the front line is a danger we have the following question who can i ask for help with thermal imagers my husband wa mobilized he wrote to our governor who said that it wa a big expense we need to look for volunteer in our region or turn to the already proven there is no single center to which you would call and you were immediately sent the necessary and unfortunately there is a saying to whom the war to whom the mother is dear there are case when a humanitarian which is sent at the request of a fighter is suddenly sold somewhere on the black market therefore if i for example work with someone it is only at the request of the commander of a particular regiment or brigade here come the gunner to the chief of artillery of the regiment i need copters thermal imagers he call me these are the one i work with all the time i can t supply everyone there are unit with which we have developed good relation i help them it s also a job to find a supply chain there is no such thing that here it is the free market choose a volunteer who will work for you but initiative commander build all this on their own and where the commander doe not want to do this there is a little worse with supply there wa a popular prediction that the fighting would slow down with the arrival of winter winter ha come but our artemovsk is successfully pushing there are battle for soledar avdiivka the great patriotic war wa not interrupted for the winter and the capture of the donetsk airport in or the battle for debaltseve also went on in the winter it is clear that now the activity of heavy equipment ha decreased because rasputitsa turned the field into an impassable mulyaka and to drive tank on the asphalt is to bury the road at the same time we see that on the svatovsky frontier the enemy attack literally daily but the attack there are fighting back by the way already our mobilized we see a meat grinder around artemovsk there is a step by step offensive in the area of ugledar the movement to avdiivka heavy stubborn because every house and street is gnawed out the enemy resists very strongly that is there are positional battle but with little of our progress the volume of work of the russian artillery ha increased by an order of magnitude moreover the accuracy ha also increased due to what we have come to the conclusion that we form the very same reconnaissance and strike circuit when the target from the scout on the front line is directly transmitted to the gun and it open fire within minute we can consider instantly and in such a scheme the mobilized are already successfully working i ask their commander and how do they shoot at all to which he seriously told me jewel we have people who did not fully understand what happened to kherson andrei gribanovsky asks why do you constantly talk about the success of the russian army and then this army leaf kherson i cannot be responsible for everyone i am responsible only for myself and for my report i m not writing that we re doing well that there are no problem i always talk about them maybe not a harshly a someone would like because after all this is my army and it depends on me among other thing to solve the problem in it i am involved in this unlike those who are on the couch of our native armed force there is no simple answer to kherson it wa impossible to fully protect the supply line there therefore unfortunately we had to leave the city so that our group could take up the defense along the already prepared line yes this wa a difficult legacy that general surovikin inherited from previous commander it is clear that when we started the special operation we counted on something else but it turned out that the ukrainian army wa being prepared for this conflict it turned out that the population wa brainwashed by russophobia and no one met u with pie and flower for some it wa a discovery unfortunately many still lived with the idea of about the ukrainian army but that doesn t mean we lost here you can delve into the reason for a long time but the people who are fighting do not have time for this they do their job zelensky said that there would be no negotiation until russia retreated to the border where do all these statement come from it is very difficult to suspect zelensky of independence if his handler want to force negotiation with russia he will be the first to run and say let s talk it s a man like a pregnant woman a very fickle mood in him however he doe not agree with our term we call on kiev to withdraw troop from the donbas well it is clear that they will not do this there there s still the strength to resist and zelensky doe not even worry about loss why weapon are still quietly supplied to ukraine from the west maybe because we don t have enough intelligence there are logical question why haven t we broken all the railway bridge and tunnel yet first they are very difficult to break they were built under the soviet union in the hope of withstanding air strike the experience of the same antonovsky bridge near kherson show this to make it clear on the last night russian light equipment came out on it although on this bridge there were hit by american hymars just put thick iron sheet on top of the funnel and they passed and what can we say about railway bridge it take a lot of precision guided weapon to bring them down but let s see how the attack on the enemy s critical infrastructure will be conducted further because this also ha a great effect let it not be lightning fast let it be cumulative here the question is raised that ukrainian city remain without electricity and water i have a dispute with the citizen of ukraine in absentia about this listen if you are left without light or water then in donetsk without water for several month kiev ha been killing the infrastructure of donbas for eight year but everyone ha been silent and silent here i see but here i don t see is that the case and the problem of electricity at social facility are solved very simply with diesel generator you will ask your authority why generator are not installed in your hospital why is it more important for your authority to spend money on the shell with which they hit the peaceful quarter of donetsk that s what you re going to ask obviously the main beneficiary of the conflict in ukraine are not even the west a a whole but the united state what need to happen for them to say that s it enough is enough let s stop yeah they won t stop anything i assure you they do not have a goal for ukraine to defeat russia they have one goal to destroy russia to exhaust economically to swing from the inside this is the task of the american many may say that this is a clich propaganda but no it s a reality and therefore it seems to me that the main beneficiary can be russian industry the defense industry science which now a in the great patriotic war should grow by leap and bound and supply to the forefront what could turn the conflict we simply have no other choice now when the united state is so close to it cherished goal of destroying russia it will not simply abandon this goal read also mobilized men in the trench say we want to attack voenkor alexander kots told what russia lack for victory and when to wait for it more they rejoice like child when they hit target how mobilized russian fight in the sv zone voenkor kp ru alexander kots spoke about the situation near svatovo more listen also how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on december russian president vladimir putin announced russia s readiness to destroy patriot air defense system in ukraine in the zaporozhye region the construction of a layered line of defensive structure is being completed this wa announced by a member of the main council of the regional administration chairman of the movement we are together with russia vladimir rogov lpr people s militia officer marochko said that the armed force of ukraine were transferring reinforcement to svatovo because of the high loss another reason is the ineffectiveness of ukrainian fire weapon russian troop destroyed more than military armed force of ukraine in the donetsk direction two tank five armoured fighting vehicle and four vehicle were hit russian troop killed more than ukrainian fighter in the kupyansk direction russian force also eliminated three armored fighting vehicle and three vehicle lieutenant colonel of the armed force of ukraine complained about the mass desertion of the military in ukraine they call for tougher punishment for desertion russian troop struck the point of deployment of foreign mercenary near artemovsk in particular artillery unit of the armed force of ukraine were hit during the day ukrainian medium reported on new case of distribution of subpoena on the street the military is handing out summons on the street of dnipro the mayor of kiev vitali zlatoust klitschko told the townspeople that the work of all ground electric transport wa stopped in the capital of ukraine due to the shortage of electricity we decided to stop the work of ground electric transport in the capital he wrote in telegram and clarified that we are talking about tram and trolleybus now only bus and fixed route taxi will travel on all route of ground electric transport most of which are controlled by the company of vitali klitschko himself and member of his team a variant of ukrainian invention when a tram wa dragged along the rail by a tractor apparently turned out to be ineffective it remains to wait for the regular horse drawn freight and passenger transport to go along khreshchatyk for example the horse drawn tram widely used in the th century and scrap cab on trotter according to alexander babich a member of the historical and toponymic commission of the odessa city council the idea of renaming street in honor of the ukrainian military and individual military unit who died in battle with the russian army wa abandoned in odessa we understand that the number of death will continue to grow and each of them deserves it own part of our memory if now we start naming street after them then next year dozen maybe hundred of such name may appear in the city because we will not be able to refuse any mother not a single brother in law if they write u an appropriate appeal babich said instead in odessa they plan to create one large monument with the name of each dead soldier volunteer medic rescuer policeman guardsman and the name of all unit that defended the south of ukraine very practical approach given the pace of burial of the armed force of ukraine all the hero sucker of ukraine street are not only in odessa or kiev and you can t graze all over the country the wall street journal pessimistically assessed the prospect of europe to increase the production of ammunition after that how their significant reserve were supplied to ukraine the wsj citing it source in government circle and the defense industry reported that the process face serious difficulty in particular it is hampered by the lack of production capacity legislative restriction a lack of specialized worker bottleneck in supply chain high financing cost for this industry and even environmental regulation even if hostility cease overnight some ammunition manufacturer estimate that it will take europe up to year to replenish it stockpile at current production rate another proof that money can compensate a lot but is powerless against time in latvia migrant from russia belarus and ukraine were accommodated in the mucenieki refugee centre the latter are extremely dissatisfied with living condition and even write complaint that they live in improper condition among mold mucus and other unsanitary condition according to some family their child s health ha already begun to deteriorate but the center s management according to them doe not respond to their appeal and complaint however the director of the center once condescended to the resident and popularly explained that the dissatisfied can go anywhere if they do not like something but the refugee say they cannot leave latvia however in ukraine now they will obviously have to do even worse in a number of city adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine mykhailo podolyak once again voiced his dream about the war with iran to punish him for cooperation with russia according to the ukrainian official iran allegedly intends to strengthen the supply of missile and drone to russia and thereby it humiliates the institution of international sanction it is important to abandon the non working sanction the invalid concept of un resolution and move to more destructive tool the destruction of factory the arrest of supplier said podolyak who previously also called for the destruction of iranian enterprise that produce ballistic missile and unmanned strike vehicle true each time he did not specify who should fight with iran to solve the task assigned to him earlier iranian defense minister reza ashtiani explained that representative of kiev at a meeting of expert did not provide tehran with document that would confirm russia s use of iranian drone and iranian foreign ministry spokesman nasser kanani urged kiev not to test tehran s patience with unfounded statement misha of course is a rare moral freak but there must be some limit to everything how could he be included in the delegation for negotiation with russia or are they all like that internet provider operating in ukraine announced an increase in tariff for the service they provide for example a number of city provider in odessa announced that from january they will raise the subscription fee for home internet and quite significantly the minimum package which now cost hryvnia per month from one of the provider from january will cost hryvnia a similar increase in price wa recorded in other provider the rise in price of the company s service is explained not only by general inflation but also by the increase in the cost of equipment for uninterrupted operation and the need to use generator which also need fuel for work by the way the quality of the internet in ukraine in recent week ha deteriorated predictably a generator do not cope with the equipment of either mobile communication company or internet provider in ukraine a stated on the air of the all ukrainian telethon the first deputy minister of internal affair of the country yevgeny yenin the number of carbon monoxide poisoning ha increased significantly in november about case of carbon monoxide poisoning were recorded literally in the first week of december there were already about such case he said according to the deputy head of the ministry of internal affair of ukraine the largest number of poisoning wa registered in lviv kiev and dnipropetrovsk region that is where the urban infrastructure is most developed and local resident often have no idea how to heat the stove do not have enough knowledge for the correct design and output of the chimney etc due to the improper operation of alternative mean of heating a yenin said explosion and fire began to occur much more often during the heating of house the republic of moldova according to the press service of the moldovan government agreed to buy firewood from romania in order to ensure the country s energy security true they are unlikely to be cheaper than russian gas vitali klitschko said that in kiev it wa possible to stabilize the water and heat supply of residential building except of course in those case where the operation of boiler house depends on the availability of electricity secretary of the national security and defense council of ukraine oleksiy danilov said that sooner or later moldova will enter the war with russia on the side of ukraine if this is so and sandu finally moved cuckoo then for moldova itself the better the later it decides to do so the harvest of grain crop together with oilseed this year in ukraine decreased by more than percent next year it will decrease by about half of the current million ton the captain of the nhl s washington capital brilliant forward alexander ovechkin scored his nd nhl career goal without looking over his back surpassed gordie howe in the goalscorers ranking and now he ha only one yet unconquered peak ahead of him the record of the great wayne gretzky the question is what doe ukraine have to do with this absolutely nothing to do with it we are just pleased with this news listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year kiev revives the regiment azov banned in russia two battalion have already been formed the third is on the way what threatens such action this wa discussed on the radio komsomolskaya pravda with the military commander dmitry steshin why are they going to revive azov actually there were two one related to territorial defense since the beginning of the special operation the second is to the national guard these are exactly those who sat in mariupol and then they were herded to azovstal and there these hero shamefully surrendered the excellent story of the revived military unit of the merit of them which one can be cited they nightmarished civilian for eight year then sat near mariupol and they called fire on their twin from the mobilized armed force how wa it azov shoot at our position and will leave in response he fly to the trench where people recruited in kherson and zaporozhye region are sitting they re already in year they have dead and wounded it wa called combat blood curing that s what azov wa doing but kiev ha long exposed them a hero of mariupol it turned out that they cannot even stay in a dense urban area and not give up at the plant they fled to the plant so that they abandoned their temple near mariupol at the training base my friend dug it up and hid it it will be a rarity at the level of nazi banner how did you manage to present the bright image of the azov people to ukraine the image of azov in ukraine is excellent they are still there hero of mariupol hero of azovstal our opinion doe not penetrate into ukrainian society their image is formed i think azov is being revived precisely under western mercenary why under them this is a recognizable military brand in the west they want to bring in a new flow of volunteer probably there are still idiot in the west azov ha always positioned itself a a neo nazi international organization where people fight for white idea and there will be a second edition what are they counting on perhaps they have the only military brand left that will help ukraine in propaganda in it difficult struggle for the interest of the west zelensky s visit to america coincided with information about the return of azov this is related if they want to continue to bring mercenary from the west instructor to ukraine then azov is a legal roof for foreigner where they will feel comfortable where there are no big question we have whatever volunteer terrorist organization you want banned in russia listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year on a foggy morning a few month ago valentyn dmytrovych yermolenko an aging ukrainian fisherman with a bad back and horrible knee puttered down a narrow channel off the dnipro river his inflatable dinghy cutting through the mist his city kherson had been taken over by the russian army and on the floor of his boat concealed under a fishing net in a black plastic tub mr yermolenko had hidden three disassembled automatic rifle a he took a bend in the river he recalled a russian patrol boat materialized in front of him a commander standing on the deck in crisp camouflage barked grandpa where are you going after mr yermolenko muttered something about getting fish for his wife the commander ordered a search of the boat a young soldier stomped aboard and went straight to the black plastic tub what is this he asked mr yermolenko said he wa so scared that he wet his pant kherson at the mouth of the dnipro near the black sea wa captured in the war s first day russian official soon declared it part of russia forever kherson s occupation government run by russian military commander and ukrainian collaborator wasted little time pulling down ukrainian flag taking over ukrainian school trucking in crate of russian ruble even importing russian family perhaps nowhere else in ukraine did russia s leader vladimir v putin devote so much money and violence the carrot and the stick to bend a city to his imperial will but it did not work guided by contact in the ukrainian security service an assembly of ordinary citizen formed themselves into a grass root resistance movement in dozen of interview resident and ukrainian official described how retiree like mr yermolenko along with student mechanic grandmother and even a wealthy couple who were fixing up their yacht and got trapped in the city for the better part of a year became spirited partisan for the kherson underground it wa like something out of a spy movie they took clandestine video of russian troop and sent them to ukrainian force along with map coordinate they used code name and password to circulate gun and explosive right under the russian nose some even formed small attack team that picked off russian soldier at night making the fear and paranoia that settled over the city two sided when the russian army hastily pulled out in mid november perhaps the biggest embarrassment so far to mr putin s war effort kherson became a powerful symbol to ally questioning ukraine s resolve and to ukrainian themselves who had suffered so much misery and death and needed a glimmer of hope kherson showed what wa possible now that the russian force are gone and people feel free to talk about what they did and even brag a little one message keep emerging i never questioned what we were doing said dmytro yevminov the yacht owner whom mr yermolenko recruited into hiding gun and sack of grenade in various boatyard i never knew i loved my country so much mr yermolenko and his wife olena might not seem like insurgent type hovering over each other in their small kitchen the rushing blue flame on the stove serving a the home s only source of heat they shoo each other away and shush each other arguing over who is the bigger patriot i m the one who forced you to feel like this she said laughing well mr yermolenko sighed maybe this country didn t give me everything i wanted but it s still my country they met in kherson in she wa a clerk at a shipbuilding plant he had been born in belarus and had just exited the soviet army he spied her sunbathing on a beach alongside the dnipro river and soon they married moving to a riverside kherson neighborhood called the island where people make their living off the water one way or another fishing working at boatyard or at the shipbuilding plant servicing marine engine the yermolenkos used to run a smoked fish business but retired a few year ago it wa not long before their life were upended on feb the first day of the invasion thousand of russian troop poured into kherson which had a population of about before the war like in many other ukrainian city local resident some with military experience banded together into a group known a a territorial defense force to try to repel moscow s army mr yermolenko and his teenage grandson also named valentyn enlisted they had few weapon mostly just some old hunting rifle worse the ukrainian military made a strategic decision to withdraw from kherson leaving the local fighter on their own they tried to ambush a russian column a few day after the invasion but failed miserably according to witness leaving at least militia member dead on the frozen ground after that the kherson resistance changed tactic it went underground member of the local defense force and other civilian began to spy on russian troop in the city the ukrainian security service encouraged this within day of the war breaking out they set up special channel on telegram and other messaging service for people to funnel strategic tip the yermolenkos volunteered to aggregate information from their neighborhood since they had been living on the island for so long they knew everyone and mr yermolenko maintained contact within the ukrainian military from his connection to the territorial defense force every day the yermolenkos said they received dozen of video audio file and text tracking the location of russian troop moving through their city how many there were what kind of vehicle they were using and their direction of travel all this wa incredibly dangerous but countless people were willing to do it we had a grandma in a high rise feeding u stuff m yermolenko said we had dima and oksana on the water in their sailboat watching the russian river patrol we had people everywhere their house they said became a transmitter the resistance movement would soon evolve in the next few week ukrainian military commander and intelligence agent based outside the city asked civilian whom they trusted including the yermolenkos to do even more life wa getting grim kherson wa running out of food store were closed people were out of work russian troop were searching for civilian who were spying on them many resident shared disturbing story of themselves or people they knew being dragged into torture chamber and subjected to electric shock and sadistic beating but the resident kept finding avenue of resistance in mid april a rash of yellow ribbon mysteriously appeared all over kherson spray painted on building it wa a small act of defiance but resident said that russian soldier were so enraged that they had stormed into hardware store and demanded to see closed circuit tv footage to find out who had been buying yellow paint a the week ticked away mr yermolenko became more careful in whom he confided he said slowly he struck up a friendship with mr yevminov a successful entrepreneur whose around the world sailboat trip went by the wayside the two men huddled by the waterfront pretending that they were staring at circle from fish jump or talking about boat and spied on russian patrol prowling the river one day mr yermolenko who tends not to express a lot of emotion pulled mr yevminov aside and said will you feed my dog if something happens to me mr yermolenko felt himself getting sucked into a more dangerous role he said that he had started receiving coded message from contact within the resistance network about weapon the message were fragmentary a code name a location a password his job wa to move assault rifle bullet and grenade from one location to another mr yermolenko along with other member of kherson s partisan network and a ukrainian military officer from the city said in interview that the weapon had passed from civilian to civilian eventually they were handed over to undercover ukrainian security agent who had filtered quietly back into kherson or to member of the underground territorial defense force the system wa built like link in a chain said oleksandr samoylenko head of kherson s regional council who helped coordinate partisan activity from outside the city no person knew the next link so if someone got caught it wouldn t compromise the whole operation the yermolenkos grandson at the time wa itching to get involved he joined a cell with three other young men that stalked russian soldier at night the russian troop were sloppy he said often walking around the waterfront in the dark while checking their phone oblivious to the glow they were casting he said that his team had killed at least russian his claim could not be independently verified but interview with other member of the local defense force supported his account that he had killed enemy soldier in the beginning he admitted we were terrified one friend he said swallowed a glass of vodka before every attack but soon enough valentyn said they became steeled to shooting russian soldier at close range and plucking weapon off their still warm body by summer mr yermolenko wa watching his city get russified propaganda billboard on kherson s busiest boulevard were decorated with band of white blue and red in the spirit of the russian flag which many local derisively called the aquafresh act of defiance kept popping up when the occupation government severed trade link with ukraine and then instructed transportation company in kherson to haul stolen ukrainian grain to russia some refused which wa no small risk they assaulted our country said roman denysenko the owner of a trucking company who wa later kidnapped i wasn t going to work with them period russian family began to move into apartment vacated by fleeing ukrainian russian child who resident said were the child of intelligence agent became a common sight in kherson s park and supermarket but moscow s hold on kherson wa getting shakier mr samoylenko the kherson regional council head said that civilian working with the army had sent in real time surveillance information that enabled ukrainian force to bomb a meeting of high level collaborator in mid september and a hotel full of russian intelligence officer a few week later he cited two factor behind those success american precision artillery and partisan intelligence it s only because of the resident that the liberation happened so quickly he said flush with new more powerful weapon the ukrainian military ratcheted up the pressure they blew up bridge across the dnipro river ground force advanced across the countryside and pressed in on three side by early november the russian force had begun to flee we didn t know what wa happening out there mr yermolenko said but on nov a repairman banged on his gate and joyously announced that ukrainian force had arrived mr and m yermolenko drove to kherson s main square joining the crowd of stunned happy people celebrating the city s liberation you wouldn t believe what i did for the first time in my life he said i kissed a policeman the yermolenkos felt that it wa important to recognize everyone in the neighborhood who had participated in the resistance so on a recent morning two dozen partisan men and woman from their early s to mid s wrapped in heavy coat and woolen hat stood in their yard the wind lifted off the river and whipped their ruddy face mr yermolenko began speaking many of the people here he said experienced close call he knew something about that from his encounter on the river in may when the russian patrol stopped him that day the soldier cracked open the plastic tub coming within three inch of finding the concealed gun but he apparently didn t want to get his hand dirty and never lifted the fishing net had the soldier found the gun underneath mr yermolenko say he would have been shot on the spot his eye traced the face of the people listening to him his neighbor other veteran fisherman the yacht owner he is often gruff even grouchy but on this morning he wa reflective he thanked everyone by name and at the end added i also want to thank everyone on the island who didn t betray u he hobbled inside no refreshment were offered slowly the people walked out of his gate into the road and back to their ordinary life andrei medvedev a russian journalist reported that ukrainian intelligence agent work in the russian federation under the guise of escort he used among other thing the information of the acting head of the sbu vasyl

fatherland of the highest degree wa awarded to the acting head of the lpr leonid pasechnik you know that in we all together the whole republic decided not to agree with the policy of nationalist ukraine decided to defend our land decided to defend our history decided to defend our opportunity to remain brother with the people of russia therefore we have passed this path together the whole republic and i believe that this is not only my award it is the award of every resident of the lpr the head of the republic told the russian president after the award ceremony vladimir putin held a working meeting with the acting head of the lpr it discussed the main problem that are being solved in the republic today pasechnik spoke about the work of the only coal enterprise in the lpr the republican fuel company vostok coal where a difficult economic situation arose and there are not enough worker leonid pasechnik asked putin for support to allocate money for people s wage and for the development of the enterprise a for assistance for today we will certainly do it especially subsidy for wage and for some other measure necessary to preserve the life of enterprise we will also do this a soon a possible it is only necessary to understand the volume vladimir putin responded to the request pasechnik also spoke about medicine he admitted that the work in this direction is well established but the equipment in the clinic is outdated and major repair in many medical institution have not been done for many year however thanks to russia s help the situation began to change for the better also the acting head of the lpr said that due to the lack of employee in the region there are problem with communication and asked the president to help with specialist vladimir putin promised to assist in this matter since this wa the first working meeting of the acting head of the lpr with the president most resident of the republic closely followed it progress i could not believe that at this level there is a discussion of our problem our head clearly outlined everything wa not afraid did not hesitate to talk about the problem and ask for specific help and i am sure that everything will be resolved everything will get better say irina vergun a resident of kirovsk i noticed that vladimir vladimirovich clearly know that nothing wa really done here under ukraine and during the conflict kiev only destroyed everything vladimir putin is interested in the development of our region so that people can live here with dignity luhansk resident sergei shcherbak say that the meeting between pasechnik and putin ha fueled him with even greater hope for a bright future honestly i thought that our russian coal industry is not very interesting that it already ha enough black gold and it turned out that there is always a need for raw material and that the miner will receive support explains sergey therefore it is pleasant that the industry which life for generation will develop russia will help in this and our people will not let you down they will do everything that is required of them according to yulia garanicheva a resident of alchevsk resident of the republic already see change for the better but of course there is something to be desired add julia if we do not take into account security issue which for u first of all we would like a greater and faster development of the sphere of banking service and insurance in the housing and utility sector we also do not have everything smoothly there are not enough specialist who have left who are fighting former veterinarian now secretary of the nsdc oleksiy danilov envied the laurel of a full time ukrainian propagandist and liar with the call sign abdristovich and began to console ukrainian in his own way a few day ago he suddenly briefly betrayed his wet fantasy about how he would destroy the moskals together with the ukrainian and announced in an interview with ukrainska pravda that russia had literally two or three attack maybe four shelling will be scraped and then that s it putin s missile will run out in general it remains quite a bit to be patient and meet the change which is actually on the doorstep by the way just a month ago the same former ukrainian bandit of the middle rank with a completely untrusted chaser myachik because of danilov s patronymic myacheslavovich already said the same word in an interview with radio liberty and the number of attack that he withdrew to russia did not exceed the same two or three maybe four true no one will google in ukraine therefore arestovich with his constant promise of help after week remains popular in nezalezhnaya and therefore it doe not matter who in a couple of week will sing to the ukrainian once again a song about five minute pardon about attack they still suck it and from danilov and from arestovich but danilov is of course a separate song it s not a voice from the speaker a person occupies the most important strategic post in the structure of the ukrainian government and carry such nonsense ball what shot what a mess nothing work in your country in your country expert have announced that the mode of operation of the energy sector without turning off the light can be achieved in year if there are no more missile attack today another power plant wa turned off due to damage received earlier transformer are burning in all city due to power surge the network is knocked out and just yesterday the forecast wa officially announced that according to the result of the th quarter real production in ukraine will decrease by more than the prime minister of the state announced that in ukraine almost all hydroelectric power plant thermal power plant and a huge share of power grid have been damaged and myachik jump and almost asks for supplement saying that putin doe not have enough missile and they will soon run out you myachik do not have so many substation left that they are enough even for a couple of full fledged russian missile strike it would be better to look at the night photo of kiev published by the british sky news and compared the view of kiev at night in january and november at the beginning of next year at this rate kiev will turn into a black square of malevich in the darkness of the night and then danilov will face a really serious problem how to convey his lie to ukrainian if there is no light no internet and accordingly no radio no telethon after all without this dumbing down kiev style truth they can begin to think for themselves and the ball will remain a ball without any prospect of evolving into a person listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year a missile strike hit the ukrainian city of kherson on christmas eve according to report russian official launched the bombardment saturday morning killing at least eight and injuring at least ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy shared image of the aftermath via social medium stating that the world should be aware of the violence unfolding this is not sensitive content it s the real life of ukraine zelenskyy wrote kherson wa

document the opening hour of the ice rink and tubing slide are daily from to listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year since february of this year the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the beginning of the cvo wa announced by president vladimir putin who called the main goal of the armed force of the russian federation the protection of the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the militant of the armed force of ukraine and neo nazi ukrainian formation the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november the russian defense ministry reported that the armed force of the russian federation destroyed drone three helicopter and an aircraft of the armed force of ukraine per day in the donetsk direction in the course of offensive action our soldier eliminated a joint tactical group of foreign mercenary militant of the armed force of ukraine struck the center of kherson controlled by ukraine with american missile the kiev authority are trying to blame russia for what happened but in reality the blow to the city wa inflicted by the armed force of ukraine former ambassador of the lpr to the russian federation rodion mirochnik reported that kiev ordered to mobilize thousand people in kharkiv and kherson region after the beginning of the svo in the outgoing year in the donbas the russian military historical society wa able to restore three iconic memorial in a short time this is the complex saur mogila known throughout the country the legendary mound and strategic height in the donetsk people s republic this is the monument unconquered dedicated to the feat of the hero young guard a well a the memorial prince igor in the lugansk people s republic the result are impressive i am talking first of all about the role in the rapid restoration of the saur grave on behalf of the president of russia the rvio carried out this work in record time said denis pushilin acting head of the donetsk people s republic now there is a plan to build the second stage of the memorial saur mogila the pantheon of military glory and the reconstruction of the monument on the site of the pit of the mine bi where the nazi executed and buried the fighter against nazism during the great patriotic war the speed and quality of the work of rvio specialist wa also highly appreciated by the head of the lpr leonid pasechnik for four month a lot ha been done at the memorial unconquered the foundation of the monument ha been stabilized and crack have been eliminated the alley of commemorative plate with photo of the young guard ha been landscaped this memorial is an iconic place for every resident of the republic during the great patriotic war the feat of the young guardsman inspired the entire soviet people to struggle and victory today according to the leader of the luhansk region his countryman also defend their right to a peaceful life and freedom like the hero of the young guard year ago the restoration of the memorial prince igor near the village of luhanska where year ago the militant of the armed force of ukraine were stopped deserves respect for the specialist who worked there in fact they worked in combat condition four time this mound wa cleared near the seversky donets and each time they found more and more ammunition our restorer did not have any problem but in the immediate vicinity there were six explosion on the petal said nikolai ovsienko deputy head of the rvio at a press conference held in the ta news agency he also said that about a thousand monument and obelisk were destroyed in the donbas during shelling from the ukrainian side this wa the state policy of the current kiev regime systematic work on their restoration is carried out by the rvio on behalf of the president of russia saturday wa marked by a very tough arrival in kherson at least eight dead civilian seriously wounded about wounded zelensky immediately issued a statement accusing russia of another crime but a you know the russian army unlike the armed force of ukraine doe not purposefully hit civilian and in general still try to avoid strike on the neighborhood of ukrainian city even when ukrainian soldier place military equipment in the courtyard a for this case there are very significant reason to believe that it wa the armed force of ukraine that struck their kherson from the american mlrs highmars this is proved by trace from the arrival of striking element in a car in kherson a if neatly carved circle with small compass indicate the use of these mlrs with striking element in the form of ball this is proved by the striking element and trace of them in car in donetsk where chimera arrive day after day and photo of the use of these missile abroad in other country in particular in the arab east etc but in russian missile that are used in ukraine the striking element have a cylindrical shape or are parallelepiped with a square cross section it turn out that zelensky s army itself shelled the city which it officially considers it own she killed her own citizen and now this whole bunch of scoundrel and scumbags in kiev with foam from the mouth accuses russia of this what blame russia is commonplace but why would they shoot at those they call their own and this is also nothing new this is also a tradition of the ukrainian lykdom let s recall how the mayor of kiev vitaly zlatoust klitschko demonstrated the striking element from the missile that flew into the house in the capital of ukraine and how then removed this photo of his palm when it turned out that he had in his hand the striking element of the outdated missile of the ukrainian air defense which in russia had long been removed from service let s remember how the armed force of ukraine shelled izyum when it wa occupied by the russian military and even kharkov and the worse the arrival at the railway station of kramatorsk of the ukrainian rocket tochka u which wa also accompanied by a large number of victim among the civilian population they were even able to photograph the body of the missile with the serial number which indisputably proved that the missilemen of the ukrainian army made a strike on their own what for the answer is simple they need a picture for the west for sponsor to intensify attention to ukraine in the world to form once again the right view and the right public opinion and in order to solve these problem and achieve their goal they do not feel sorry for their ukrainian at all moreover for kiev the inhabitant of these region at least are not quite their own and even more precisely they are not at all their own and even if they are former but pro russian kiev is ready to kill ten of thousand of such potentially wrong ukrainian if it help zelensky an additional billion or at least a tank company and those who do not die under his missile zelensky will send and send to die for him in the trench therefore we must not forget to add to the series of crime of the ukrainian leadership against donbas and russia the crime of zelensky and company and against their own country and it civilian population listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year what assessment in the state the leading medium gave to the visit of zelenskog the washington post suggested that the sixth ukrainian autocrat did not achieve the main goal he wanted more modern weapon and more the supplicant wa hugged kissed patted on the shoulder but according to a leading american publication the goal of the negotiation between the head of the two state diverged the young tragicomic dreamed of weapon of retaliation to increase the chance of success of the armed force of ukraine and the retired champion bent towards diplomatic negotiation on reservation when kiev would be ready to negotiate the term of peace and fox news anchor tucker carlson said the vovy let it again visit once again pumped billion out of the u s economy and wa humiliating for the american political elite who slapped the micro napoleon in the gum curiously hack will continue to be rolled around the world on a u air force military transporter for kissing and participating in cut kiev is trying to save bakhmut by transferring special force andriy marochko an lpr people s militia officer said kiev wa frantically moving additional unit to the artemovsk bakhmut area in an attempt to hold the city in particular an additional transfer of ukrainian special force serviceman wa noted their task include stopping panic and desertion in the rank of ukrainian serviceman do they think this is a worthy target for a real special operation force s get ready rag gerasimov spoke about the contact line valery gerasimov chief of the general staff of the russian armed force at a briefing to the military attach s of foreign country said now the line of combat contact stretch for km taking into account the measure taken to build up the combat capability of group of troop the situation on the front line

critical transport and energy infrastructure facility deep inside ukraine the attach inspected everything and conveyed new year s greeting to kyiv putin explained about the stock of weapon vladimir putin confirmed that russia is wasting military reserve and these are big number but according to the russian leader the difference with the state of the ukrainian defense complex is enormous the russian president said the difference between u and those who oppose u is that for example the ukrainian military industrial complex if not completely zeroed out then is rapidly moving towards this soon there will be no base of it own according to putin russia ha this base only growing and it will be increased not to the detriment of other sector of the economy and in general a we were taught our enemy will die and we will go to heaven the reaction in the donbas to the night attempt wa restrained denis pushilin the acting head of the dpr said that he had ceased to keep count of the number of attempt on his life on the air of the tv channel solovyov live pushilin reported yes who count them the reality of life already under god we all walk answering a question about the strike on the

turkish kayseri discussed security issue in the black sea and in order not to get up twice at the same time the crisis in ukraine the defense minister of the three southern country also noted the

missile strike wa recorded in the city similar report come from dnepropetrovsk it is also restless in zaporozhye some still hope that hospital in donetsk can be shot with impunity listen a well how

change with the onset of the new year the russian military will adapt to patriot anti aircraft missile system a they successfully resist the already supplied nato weapon now however such abandonment lead to a significant prolongation of the conflict this opinion wa expressed by military historian and expert yuri knutov in the morning broadcast on the radio komsomolskaya pravda secretary of the national security and defense council of ukraine danilov called the next two or three month of the conflict decisive what do you say or is it for year ivan pankin one of the host of the morning show what will happen asked the conflict will not end within two or three month yuri knutov said it will last maybe two or three year moreover this duration is determined not so much by u if it were not for the help of nato we would have already completed the special operation victoriously three month ago by that time we had destroyed the main type of weapon of the armed force of ukraine from to of tank armored car aircraft anti aircraft missile system mlrs and long range artillery the kiev regime simply would have nothing to fight then came the soviet style equipment from the country of the former warsaw pact which are now in nato we also demilitarized it and now basically purely nato weapon are already underway under these condition it is useless to talk about the fact that we will now begin to conduct an offensive a during the great patriotic war to cut surround smash squeezing tactic are used quite successfully i think that it will continue to be used successfully by the way we should not forget that the demilitarization of the nato bloc is going more or le well in our country at the latest meeting on arm sale to the kiev regime country from country said their military arsenal had dried up and of the remaining only the united state is ready to supply weapon in approximately the same volume in which it supply now if it were not for the u policy we could say that in two or three month the special operation would end with our victory and the surrender of the kiev regime unfortunately washington is not interested in this the u s military industrial complex only smelled the money for a long time afghanistan allowed them to receive quite serious income and the operation in ukraine increased the size of such revenue from the sale of weapon tenfold compared to afghanistan a waterfall of money fell on them why should they give it up no way they will pay their lobbyist huge fee they will put pressure on other state to keep this war going and they don t care that people are dying there will be a prolongation of the conflict through the fault of washington first of all then why doe the head of the nsdc danilov make such statement thus they are trying to cheer up their armed force and the population give a breath of optimism it s too much depression there now they say we will seize melitopol in two or three month and reach crimea in the summer zelensky is already going to rest by the sea meaning that the crimea will be ukrainian vladimir putin said that russia doe not intend to repeat the mistake of the past when for the sake of increasing the defense capability it destroyed the country s economy we will not engage in the militarization of the country and the economy what mistake are we talking about this refers to the soviet period when the production of consumer good wa on the outskirt television radio were produced mainly from rejected part transistor were produced for defense need the batch wa checked some number turned out to be faulty this whole batch is sent to the production of television and then they break down six month later all this caused serious discontent the money went to armament the maintenance of the army in the s we found ourselves in such a position that the store were empty clothes of unclear size and shape and all this formed a serious discontent which among other thing contributed to the collapse of the soviet union we laughed when himars wa handed over to ukraine but himars proved to be very capable now the american are transferring the patriot air defense system to ukraine in the beginning there were javelin we were very afraid of them and then it turned out that they came up with an interesting thing cheap primitive and simple but very effective which protects armored vehicle from them it s the same story with himars they beat accurately effectively time passed the technology of how to shoot them down wa worked out algorithm appeared flight telemetry wa recorded and software wa developed put other air defense system shoot down to the same story will be with patriot at first they will work effectively we will study them look at the frequency characteristic they have a lot of vulnerability the sector is not degree but degree big problem with mobility minute the complex turn and collapse our complex do it in minute in modern combat minute is an extremely long time during this time the complex can be detected and destroyed we have anti radar missile which we will also refine for patriot frequency one patriot is worth billion a single patriot missile cost between and million range from to kilometer the european version of the missile in the same germany is a range of kilometer the complex deployed on the territory of poland along the border with ukraine will create a de facto no fly zone over the territory of western ukraine that s the danger there you can place base headquarters warehouse training center command post in western ukraine and all this will be covered by patriot which are on polish territory which we cannot shoot at what patriot will give to ukraine is to see how these system behave in real combat condition they will be effective against cruise missile but against drone i doubt it it s like shooting gold bullet at sparrow listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year since february of this year the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the cvo wa announced by president vladimir putin who called the main goal of the armed force of the russian federation the protection of the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the ukrainian military and nationalist the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november the ministry of defense of the russian federation officially reported the destruction of american artillery system that shelled donetsk also near donetsk the russian military together with calculation eliminated two ukrainian combat vehicle of the grad multiple launch rocket system the american newspaper the new york time published an article in which it positively assessed the military talent of the commander of the russian joint group of troop in the zone of the military special operation in ukraine general sergei surovikin military historian yuri knutov said that washington is deliberately trying to freeze the conflict in order to delay the special operation of the russian federation in ukraine the influential american newspaper new york time made a forecast for the winter military campaign in ukraine naturally by interviewing expert associated with the army intelligence agency and the u government some calculation of this forecast surprise with their cynicism but it is undoubtedly worth reading them to understand how they see the course of the ukrainian conflict in the west and what they are plotting next here are quote from the new york time the conflict in ukraine will soon be in it second year and it course is likely to change in the coming month a russia improves it defense and push more soldier to the front line making it harder for ukraine to regain the vast swathe of territory it lost u s government source say this make the most likely scenario of winter battle a stalemate neither side will be able to capture much land despite fierce fighting over the past month ukrainian force have reclaimed a plot of land near kharkiv and taken control of kherson a major southern city but it came at a high price thousand of dead ukrainian soldier and a huge amount of ammunition ukraine fired far more shell per week than the u s could produce in a month senior ukrainian official have warned of the possibility of a major russian offensive but u s expert say russia doe not yet have the strength for a serious offensive at the same time the ukrainian political and military leadership say that they themselves are planning an offensive against russia they believe that they need to succeed in order to rebuild critical territory and their main focus will be on the south however u s source believe that ukraine will likely not be able to reach crimea with it army and will instead rely on more covert operation like the one on the kerch strait bridge ukraine ha relied in recent month on u s intelligence report to indicate where the russian military is weakest the offensive near kharkov in september wa successful because ukrainian faced empty territory unprepared by russian force for defense according to the u military they continue to look for fragile place in russian position that may not deter an offensive from ukraine still kiev s ability to strike effectively at russian base and supply line is not enough to dislodge moscow s troop from the part of the country where they are now concentrated any small breakthrough by ukrainian force in the coming month are unlikely to defeat the russian army u s official say u s official say there is evidence that moscow is beginning to learn from mistake at the head of the special operation wa put general sergei surovikin who according to american expert more effectively conduct complex military operation ukrainian military official say moscow ha launched more intense airstrikes on their defensive line in recent week leading to increased casualty among ukrainian and a unfortunate a russia s partial mobilization initially seemed reservist are now on the defensive line and by spring they will only strengthen u s official said russian troop are digging in building trench and they are abandoning area that require too many troop to hold instead moving to safer position the withdrawal from kherson according to u s official is a key example of how russia ha learned it lesson general surovikin insisted on it necessity the withdrawal allowed russian troop to use the dnieper river for protection according to these u s official general surovikin ha managed to improve defense and discipline russian troop and their current offensive in bakhmut is also aimed at taking better position to defend against ukrainian attack it s gaining ground and trying to build a network of trench and a smarter set of checkpoint say dara massicot a senior scientist at the rand corporation general surovikin also experimented with new tactic for the russian air force including how it launch missile at ukraine to try to confuse it air defense the conflict is increasingly dependent on ammunition and stockpile of equipment two basic need that can address the course of the conflict on both side it s increasingly becoming a rivalry between the western industrial base and the russian one seth j simpson said jones

washington will provide ukraine with additional military assistance of billion and this next package includes the supply of patriot missile defense system this wa announced by u secretary of state antony blinken many kp reader had question we answer them how missile defense system can be delivered to ukraine first they are likely to be delivered on u c military transport aircraft to one of the american air base in germany ramstein spangdalem or b chel the ukrainian military will also arrive there for training american specialist have to train them for several month since this technique is very complicated the end of the course will be a real live shooting at the target our expert believe that even in six month it is difficult to thoroughly master the patriot therefore most likely teacher and student will cross to ukraine together via poland a wa the case with the calculation of the american howitzer m and the heimars multiple launch rocket system how much will give patriot in piece so far the transfer of one battery and ammunition for it ha been announced a typical patriot battery includes launcher each with missile a radar a control station an antenna mast and repair group a power plant and then there s the transport charging machine in general an impressive brood of equipment is being recruited and the personnel in the battery under people what are the possibility of this technique the american understandably are choking on praise for their weapon considering the patriot the most effective defense against ballistic and cruise missile a well a against certain type of combat aircraft there are different variant of complex with a firing range of to km target detection range is km for comparison the target detection range of the main competitor of the patriot the russian s complex km the range of destruction km our specialist are much more restrained in their assessment yes patriot is a serious weapon but it also ha drawback here they are the radar station doe not have a circular view only in the direction of the expected threat already on this drawback it would be possible to put an end since any approach of a missile or aircraft a drone from the flank or behind will remain invisible to the patriot the viewing sector is only degree that mean the other are dead zone the minimum height of target captured by radar is meter while modern cruise missile can fly at an altitude of meter from the ground not to mention kamikaze drone which can fly at an altitude of meter the patriot radar cannot track target with speed of le than meter per second this mean that low speed drone including artisanal one remain invisible the u s patriot wa already badly disgraced in saudi arabia in when local houthi rebel attacked oil refinery these enterprise protected american missile defense system and they didn t save saudi factory from houthi missile they didn t even react u secretary of state mike pompeo then said that the missile defense system which included the patriot could not repel the strike since all such system attention work with varying success well well how the appearance of a miracle missile defense can affect the course of a special operation if the patriot are not around the city of ukraine although logically or even battery will have to be placed near kiev large headquarters and military factory but on the battlefield this may create some problem the american missile defense system will a it know how counteract russian aviation so our aircraft will have to stay away from the affected area a for drone when attacked by a pack on the patriot it radar begin to choke but the caliber and dagger with their crazy speed are not at all up to the american but even with all this the patriot factor should not be underestimated it appearance in any case will not weaken but strengthen the air defense of ukraine can we destroy the patriot first of all of course our intelligence should know the place of unloading and the transportation route of the american missile defense system in ukraine then it is very easy to cover such a target with a hypersonic missile well if it doe not work you will have to calibrate the patriot in the position how patriot supply could affect u s russia relation well known political scientist dmitry evstafiev answered this question a follows sending such weapon will mean the involvement of the united state in the conflict in ukraine at a new level this is a dangerous sign and the new level is the appearance in ukraine of large full time combat unit of the u

russian language material if they are not accompanied by a translation into ukrainian the observer noted that for at least a third of the resident of the independent ukrainian is not their native

change with the onset of the new year when video and photo emerged in april showing body of dozen of civilian strewn along a street in bucha ukrainian and the rest of the world voiced horror and outrage but in russia official had a completely different reaction denial president vladimir v putin dismissed the gruesome scene a a provocation and claimed that the russian army had nothing to do with it but an eight month visual investigation by the new york time concluded that the perpetrator of the massacre along yablunska street were russian paratrooper from the th air assault regiment led by lt col artyom gorodilov the evidence show that the killing were part of a deliberate and systematic effort to ruthlessly secure a route to the capital kyiv soldier interrogated and executed unarmed men of fighting age and killed people who unwittingly crossed their path whether it wa child fleeing with their family local hoping to find grocery or people simply trying to get back home on their bicycle we identified of the ukrainian victim killed along yablunska street read more about their final moment time reporter spent month in bucha after russian force withdrew interviewing resident collecting vast trove of security camera footage and obtaining exclusive record from government source in new york time investigator analyzed the material and reconstructed the killing along this one street down to the minute some of the most damning evidence implicating the th included phone record and decoded call sign used by commander on russian radio channel it all point to a brazen and bloody campaign that turned a quiet suburban street into what resident now call the road of death historically journalist and investigator relied on a single photograph or video to expose wartime atrocity in time magazine published a photo of an emaciated prisoner in bosnia on it cover almost year later a video captured the execution of captured tamil tiger fighter in the final day of sri lanka s civil war what differentiates the evidence discovered in bucha are the scale and detail that link a single unit and it commander to specific killing with possible implication for ongoing investigation the international criminal court i c c is already investigating possible war crime and other atrocity in ukraine this kind of digital evidence is a sea change especially compared to past investigation such a in the former yugoslavia said matthew gillett a senior lecturer at the university of essex who previously worked at international criminal court if any ukraine case end up at an international court such a the i c c it ha to have a significant video component here are some of the main takeaway of the investigation while various military unit were present in bucha and the death toll across the city reached over the time identified the th regiment a paratrooper unit based in the city of pskov in western russia a the main culprit in the yablunska street killing airborne unit like this are considered some of the best trained and equipped in the russian military evidence of the th s involvement includes military equipment uniform badge radio chatter and packing slip on munition crate military expert from janes and the institute for the study of war provided insight about russian armored vehicle and their marking a well a tactical operation seen in the visual evidence resident in bucha said that when russian soldier interrogated them they often seized their phone suspecting the soldier may also have taken the phone of victim our reporter obtained from ukrainian authority a database of all call and message placed from the bucha region to russia during march a we interviewed victim relative we collected their phone number and checked if they were in the database a chilling pattern emerged soldier routinely used the phone of victim to call home to russia often only hour after they were killed by analyzing the phone number dialed by russian soldier and uncovering social medium profile associated with their family member the time confirmed the identity of two dozen paratrooper a member of the th regiment in many case we interviewed their relative and spoke to some of the soldier themselves two of whom confirmed they were in the th and served in bucha we cross referenced our finding with personal data sourced from leaked and official russian database provided by the center for advanced defense study a washington d c nonprofit group focused on global security the time identified for the first time three dozen people who were killed along yablunska street in march we reviewed death certificate for most of these victim and the predominant cause of death wa gunshot wound the victim were resident of bucha or neighboring town from all age and profession among the victim killed by russian paratrooper were year old tamila mishchenko and her year old daughter anna on march they were among four woman fleeing bucha when russian soldier fired on their blue minivan nearly all the victim we identified on yablunska street were civilian or ukrainian p o w s killing them could be prosecuted by the international criminal court and deemed war crime under international humanitarian law because of their systematic and widespread nature the killing in bucha could also amount to crime against humanity russia ha not joined the i c c and is unlikely to cooperate on any potential future case that involve russian soldier the victim on yablunska street did not die in the crossfire between russian and ukrainian force nor were they mistakenly shot in the fog of war our investigation show that russian troop intentionally killed them apparently a part of a systematic clearing operation to secure the path to the capital dozen of civilian were shot dead in other case men suspected of link to the ukrainian military were rounded up and executed lt col artyom gorodilov the regiment commander at the helm of the th oversaw operation of the paratrooper unit in bucha time investigator obtained document that confirmed the call sign he used when communicating over the radio with his troop security camera along yablunska street captured some of this radio chatter establishing that lt col gorodilov wa in command and two soldier in the th who served in bucha confirmed in interview that he wa there after russian troop retreated from the kyiv region lt col gorodilov received a promotion to colonel in april from the then head of the airborne force col gen andrey serdyukov the ceremony wa held day after the shocking image from bucha emerged neither general serdyukov nor colonel gorodilov s immediate superior at the time maj gen sergey chubarykin ha publicly announced any investigation into the carnage in the town despite the global outrage over the image a superior officer they ultimately answer for the action of the force under their command by neither stopping nor investigating the atrocity in bucha they could ultimately bear responsibility for them the russian ministry of defense the russian embassy in washington and colonel gorodilov did not respond to request for comment this year would have been the th anniversary of

brutal battle throughout the war moscow is now building over the devastation bringing in people to fill the abandoned city and cleansing it of any ukrainian identity amid month of failing to advance the front line and ceding major city like kharkiv and kherson to ukrainian force the kremlin reportedly turned it focus to mariupol an investigation by the associated press found that the city is beginning to resemble a russian garrison a moscow usher in troop equipment doctor construction worker and administration official the fight for the city eventually honed in on mariupol s azovstal steel plant where ukrainian soldier and civilian became trapped under russia s relentless bombing blocking access to food water and healthcare and forcing thousand to eventually surrender the theater wa bombed by twin russian airstrikes on march and a many a people were killed in the strike in response to the devastation russia erected a screen around the building tall enough that it can be seen from space ap found caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news medicine in the kherson region are becoming more affordable on the left bank of the dnieper

in the region on the left bank of the dnieper there is also an ambulance her phone number work around the clock dear parishioner in connection with the latest event all baptismal rite conducted by priest of the uoc are canceled you can sign up for a second baptism in the ocu with the priest such announcement were full of church in ukraine just the other day and it s more than just symptomatic because in the independent state they set a course for the complete destruction of the only canonical orthodox denomination in this territory the ukrainian orthodox church moscow patriarchate uoc mp and the war wa declared not only by schismatics looking at parish and hungry for treasure who are a dime a dozen in ukraine but also by the state that joined them and at the head of the anti cross satanic campaign stood the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky the kiev regime led by zelensky on which there is no cross is leading the split of orthodoxy in ukraine russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova wrote in her telegram channel and a very rare case this time maria vladimirovna wa mistaken because the split of orthodoxy in ukraine wa started by zelensky s predecessor petro poroshenko who during his presidency together with the patriarch of constantinople a former officer of the turkish army being a greek by birth bartholomew established the so called new orthodox church of ukraine ocu and zelensky ha now moved to the final stage of the schism the destruction of the orthodox church itself to the delight of satanist around the world however about the latter a little later and now about the satanist who are now ruling their bloody trizna in ukraine even when soldier from the ukronazi formation azov banned in russia by the decision of the supreme court of the russian federation surrendered in mariupol many noted the abundance of tattoo with satanic symbol on their body one of them is in the photo in the center and these are not just picture but belonging or readiness to belong a religious expert and psychologist believe to submit to the enemy of the human race polish mercenary are quite open and proud of this filming phone on camera burning the orthodox gospel and other religious book in the fire the ukrainian military dance a white dance with an image of the crucified christ carved out of cardboard and this is a mockery not only of orthodoxy but of all of christianity regardless of denomination it s no secret that the ukrainian military and the current kiev regime are strongly supported by both the church of satan officially registered in the united state and the british satanist whose number over the past year ha grown in the uk by one and a half time and this is only according to official data and the behavior of the hierarch of this new scu doe not fit into the norm of christian morality it leader metropolitan epiphanius in the world serhiy dumenko in order to take his current post deceived and betrayed his mentor and leader the head of the schismatic uoc of the kiev patriarchate filaret which wa not recognized by anyone from the canonical church all the evil spirit gathered in ukraine united to destroy the real ukrainian orthodox church and it own leader a luck would have it were unable to resist the evil spirit by the compromiser and collaborator obedient to the zelensky regime who now in ukrainian tradition are confusedly asking are we for the scho perhaps they were frightened that criminal case were initiated against priest of the uoc from march to october for treason and separatism and dozen of cleric were beaten and ostracized unlike the leader of the uoc many priest including in western ukraine urged the flock not to move to the schismatic orthodox church of ukraine because sooner or later everything political will go away and people need to remain honest before god but the hierarch of the uoc seem to have preferred worldly good having lost their christian fortitude for normal people they could still cause pity or sympathy but for the evil spirit gathered under the guise of a kind of other christianity and the nazi state power by their helplessness they cause only joy satan triumphed in ukraine expert opinion it is not for nothing that on the bivouac of the armed force of ukraine and the position left by them our fighter often find artifact of satanist object for their rite relevant literature poster in the video those fighting on the other side burn the gospel at the stake remember the black sun and portrait of hitler and fascist flag and even discovered altar of satanist archpriest alexander novopashin a specialist in occult and satanic sect explained not just the appearance but also the stimulation of satanist in the rank of the armed force of ukraine there are no restriction for a satanist not in relation to prisoner not in relation to the civilian population not even in relation to the so called twin at the heart is service to evil and the shedding of human sacrificial blood no moral restraint no moral brake anything is possible because the only thing of value is the will of the doer someone else s life is of no value in comparison satanist have a desire to have dominion over others their goal is to bind everyone to a common crime and a common blood and everything is arranged in such a way that yesterday s killer themselves then become victim they destroy each other it is inevitable the expert continued and it is clear that zelensky now need just such an armed herd unencumbered neither by orthodoxy nor by any ethical norm and then then he hope he ll come up with something in the meantime they must kill and destroy everyone and everything without any conscience it is clear that sooner or later they will kill each other how one such warrior of light killed his family wife and young child in ternopil seeing in the coloring of a child s inflatable trampoline the color of the russian flag but we just don t have time to wait for them to kill each other there because first they ll try to do it to u in the liberated boundary holiday recently luganskgaz specialist connected percent of the residential building of rubezhne a well a

hundred special child from all over the zaporozhye region study they study the school curriculum here and study with a speech therapist and a defectologist also in the boarding school there are class of pedagogical correction according to the management of the institution such assistance for the boarding school is very important our armed force continue to advance in various direction in the zone of special military operation including in the donetsk direction what doe the ministry of defense report in it next report read carefully in the donetsk direction russian unit continued offensive operation our troop drove the enemy out of the fortified stronghold during the day more than ukrainian serviceman two infantry fighting vehicle an armored personnel carrier and three pickup truck were destroyed in this direction this message wa about december earlier it wa reported that the armed force of the russian federation are advancing in the krasno limansky direction they are regaining their position partly lost after the ukrainian counteroffensive in the kharkiv region last september despite the fact that the armed force of ukraine tried now and then to conduct reconnaissance by combat in the starobilsk direction using mainly their territorial defense detachment mobilized and border guard leaving the most combat ready unit in the rear this did not prevent the russian armed force from occupying several enemy stronghold due to the constant offensive advance of russian troop in this direction the nationalist are forced to constantly transfer reinforcement here they are trying to equip new observation post and firing position in the liman sector the allied force established control over two stronghold in the area of ploschanka also fighting continues in the gray zone on the krasnopopovka makiivka border in the lisichansk sector the fighter of the allied unit established control over the observation post in the area of belogorovka unit of the nd battalion of the st separate airmobile brigade of the armed force of ukraine were forced to retreat to replenish personnel in serebryanka even kiev is forced to admit that the armed force of ukraine have lost the momentum of the offensive or simply put they turn back the report of their ukrainian capital say that the russian armed force seized the initiative this wa pointed out through his teeth by the adviser to the office of president vladimir zelensky alexei arestovich in mark feigin s program this walking mouthpiece of the kiev regime admitted that on the ground along the entire front line there is a phase of operational and tactical pressure of russian troop in all direction earlier the telegram channel resident citing a source in the office of the ukrainian president said that zaluzhny reported to zelensky about the possible tactical encirclement of artemovsk bakhmut the channel quote internal report russian troop have increased the onslaught on the city from all side they complicated the communication of the armed force of ukraine the ukrainian army suffers heavy loss the general staff is forced to throw all new unit to protect the city ukrainian telegram channel are very reluctant to confirm the advance of russian troop in the direction of krasny liman avdiivka maryinka and with even greater reluctance they recognize the steady increase in loss on the ukrainian side among the main reason for the interception of the initiative of the armed force of the russian federation the following can be noted there is a clear advantage of the russian side in artillery system including mlrs in the timely delivery of ammunition to the position a well a in general in manpower numerous fact of demoralization in the armed formation of ukraine on the line of combat contact were revealed squad platoon company of ukrainian expose the flank of their troop fleeing to the rear or surrendering time work for russia and not only in matter of improving the quality of management of unit and subdivision the disabling of key facility of the energy system of ukraine ha already significantly complicated the supply power supply navigation and communication in the armed force of ukraine child clutch box of brand new heater with a smile mother hold heavy bag of food in their hand and teenager pack their thing preparing to go to the child s camp for an unusual shift such a blissful picture wa drawn thanks to the organizer of the humanitarian action child in the hand recently it regional headquarters wa opened in the zaporizhzhya region this unique project is being implemented in the dpr lpr and now in our region with the support of the presidential commissioner for child s right maria lvova belova a part of the action activist help child with everything they need someone asks for a

you can help the action child in the hand in social network humanitarian aid from toy to generator ha already been received by more than eight thousand child in the zaporozhye region yesterday s unexpected appearance of zelensky in bakhmut stirred up the network no worse than today s urgent flight of the president of ukraine to washington a zhvanetsky said on the case urgently but if zelensky s visit to the united state doe not cause any doubt then this cannot be said about volodymyr s stay in bakhmut the day before ukrainian blogger and admins of telegram channel themselves drew attention to the inconsistency of the surrounding situation with reality since zelensky wa filmed against the background of some production facility against the background of almost the entire factory floor some even demanded that the office of the president of ukraine indicate the geolocation in which workshop the shooting of the president took place since there wa not a single whole production facility left in the city there are no sound of explosion or shooting on the video and this despite the fact that fighting is going on in bakhmut aka artemovsk which by the way is confirmed by other more realistic video from vsushniki from there but let s approach the question from the other side let s look at the logistics of moving zelensky to bakhmut and back to washington and let s go in the opposite direction the first report of the landing of the plane with zelensky at andrew air force base in the suburb of washington appeared around am moscow time then there wa a wave of report about zelensky s arrival in washington at about p m given the flight from frankfurt am main to washington ramstein air base is near frankfurt and andrew air base is half an hour by car from the center of the u capital is about hour consequently zelensky had to fly out of germany between one o clock in the morning moscow time and am in order to arrive in this time range moving on the way from poland approximately from warsaw to frankfurt am main since it is unlikely that the plane with it wa allowed to land at a military air base although if the board with zelensky landed on the runway of the air base in germany this doe not change much will also take about hour boarding warming up the engine taxiing take off and landing etc about an hour of preparation of the aircraft for departure to the united state minus another hour we get a flight from warsaw in the period from o clock in the evening in moscow to one o clock in the morning according to information from kiev zelensky went to poland by train even if it is a special letter train that go somewhat faster than usual in which the journey from kiev to warsaw take from to hour hour at least it will spend on the road that is zelensky had to go from kiev to warsaw in any case no later than o clock in the afternoon more precisely from a m to p m moscow time but after all zelensky who together with his retinue allegedly went to bakhmut for the front still had to get there and this is also not the easiest task suppose that zelensky and his team reached the nearest regional center by car and from it flew to kiev by helicopter there are such center dnepropetrovsk in the new name dnipro zaporozhye and kharkiv departure from kharkiv is not the safest thing now but we will leave it so given the mi helicopter which according to technical characteristic reach speed of up to kilometer per hour on paper because in reality rarely anyone and when fly on them faster than at a speed of km h from the dnieper to kiev km from zaporozhye km from kharkov to the capital of ukraine km in any case about hour plus or minus that is we are talking about sending from these city to kiev from seven o clock in the morning to am moscow time kiev time from am to am but after all they also had to be reached from the front line bakhmut in which and around which there are fierce battle we take the same regional center from bakhmut to zaporozhye kilometer to dnipro km and to kharkiv km the route service give from to hour on the road that is from one o clock in the morning to am local time and something around zelensky is not a night at all on the replicated video if zelensky spent the whole way from bakhmut to kiev in a car then add here another to hour that is on the contrary unscrew the arrow a much earlier and this without eating without break on the road without traditional for any business trip cucumber boiled egg and chicken on the road which a caring wife will put in a travel bag in fact a joke because zelensky s legal wife olena life mainly in one of the european country visiting kiev on the occasion of the upcoming rendezvous with various foreign vip without smoke break sending natural need etc at the same time the first report about zelensky s stay in bakhmut in the ukrainian segment of the network appeared at p m in kiev at there wa a record that zelensky wa in bakhmut at that he left it and according to information from the same kiev the message were given with a delay of two hour that is zelensky wa allegedly in bakhmut at am where he according to our calculation simply could not be at this time because he wa preparing to leave for warsaw that s the kind of awkwardness you get according to these calculation zelensky simply could not have been in bakhmut on tuesday and it turn out he again once again deceived everyone with his inflated heroism he blew his compatriot who admired his heroism inflated the european whose eye widened with fear for the man of the year blew the american to whom he went to ask for money and weapon he just can t do it any other way you guy are welcome and you eat there and look don t mess around listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year koval wa able to enter the city under relative safety after ukrainian force ousted russian troop in september and have continuously pushed them eastward taking the fight to the center of donetsk but strike have increasingly begun to target kharkiv a russia ha once again increased it aerial campaign while it force stall on the front line including earlier this month when russia fired missile and drone in a single day at ukraine s second largest city taking out nine energy facility and leaving more than half the city without power despite significant battlefield success in recent month for ukraine intense fighting continues in the small city of bakhmut in eastern donetsk where trench warfare ha become the norm concern like trench foot frostbite and gangrene have become an everyday reality for soldier dealing with the brutal condition a winter set in koval who wa a close a mile from bakhmut where some of the most brutal fighting is raging said winter camouflage gear is at the top of soldier wish list snow ha begun to carpet battlefield across ukraine and the changing weather condition not only mean soldier need winter gear like coat boot thermal sock and sleeping bag but they need cover from russia s latest weapon of choice drone drone are a relatively more affordable way for moscow to wage war against ukraine when compared to other type of missile system and the kremlin ha ramped up it drone use in recent month across the country but troop on the front line need more than air defense to counter these weapon system koval said koval described how camo cover which act a windbreaker like covering and can fit in a backpack are used to great effect to disguise soldier and their equipment to their surroundings it s literally saving their life these camo cover so they don t get shot from the sky she said the effort which is organized under a nonprofit the kovals set up evil cannot enter heaven is a family affair caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news apu burn artemovs andrei marochko an officer of the lpr people s militia said that the armed force of ukraine in artemosk bakhmut began to purposefully destroy the surviving residential building and social facility marochko said ukrainian unit began to resort to scorched earth tactic they strike at the surviving residential building transport interchange socially important object of artemovsk the armed force of ukraine are hitting civilian infrastructure by all available mean there are no russian soldier in this city but there are still civilian in the basement but ha this ever stopped the ukrainian general zaluzhny demand tougher penalty for non compliance with the order valery zaluzhny commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine spoke in favor of adopting a bill to toughen the punishment for refusing to follow order and leaving the place of service in battle that is in fact he recognized the desertion and refusal of soldier to carry out suicide order with an appeal to sign such a law the commander in chief appealed to the sixth president of the independent country and not directly but in the telegram channel zaluzhny said the army is based on discipline often lost position have to be restored by assault action at a very high price it doesn t have to be this way nazi barrage are back in vogue the armed force of ukraine struck the office of the red cross in donetsk during the shelling by the armed force of ukraine of the kalininsky district of donetsk the office of the international committee of the red cross on kapitan ratnikov street wa damaged earlier the ombudsman of ukraine dmytro lubinets made claim to the icrc that their representative arrived at the border with the territory not controlled by kiev brisk lubinets immediately called for the elimination of the red cross brave ukrainian artilleryman seem to have heard the call of their ombudsman how much

discussed in detail the state of the army the report of the commander in chief and the head of the army lasted more than an hour we have collected their most important statement it is well known that today the military potential and capability of almost all major nato country are actively used against russia nevertheless our soldier sergeant and officer are fighting for russia courageously and steadfastly confidently step by step solving the task set and these task will certainly be fulfilled in all territory of russia including in the new territory the safe life of all our citizen will be ensured the president said at the very beginning and then announced a minute of silence for the dead putin compared the fighter of the special operation with the hero of the war with napoleon the first world war and the great patriotic war the fighting of course ha identified issue on which we must work hard including those that we have discussed more than once i mean communication automated command and control system for troop and weapon counter battery tactic and so on the head of state listed the president pointed out that all the practical experience of the military operation should be systematized and used to train new military personnel and distinguished soldier and officer should be promoted to command position a a matter of priority i expect that designer and engineer will continue to go to the front line they regularly visit there and then make adjustment to new model of equipment the russian leader said putin instructed the defense ministry the government and industrialist to continue to work in one bundle to update equipment and equipment we know that there are no trifle on the battlefield first aid kit uniform dry ration everything should be at the highest level it is necessary to saturate the troop with night vision device sight everything that a fighter need should be modern and comfortable reliable he added the head of state said that of our

putin said the partial mobilization ha revealed certain problem this is well known to everyone which should be promptly addressed i know that the necessary measure are being taken but we still need to pay attention to this and build this system in a modern way the head of state instructed he asked the defense ministry to be attentive to civil initiative take into account criticism and listen to those who do not hush up problem there ha always been our strength in the unity of the army and the people the president reminded defense minister sergei shoigu spoke after the russian leader he recalled that the west give ukraine weapon adviser and intelligence it should be noted that nato staff officer artilleryman and other specialist are in the combat zone more than u and nato spacecraft are working in the interest of the armed force of ukraine of which more than are military the rest are dual use the head of the ministry of defense reported nato country have spent billion to support kiev shoigu did not rule out that the weapon could then spread around the world a already happened after america s flight from afghanistan shoigu said that it is planned to change the age of military service when recruiting the armed force gradually increase the age of conscription of citizen from to year and raise the limit to year the army itself should also increase to guarantee the solution of the task of ensuring the military security of the russian federation it is necessary to bring the number of armed force to million serviceman including contract serviceman up to thousand people the minister suggested i agree with the proposal for further structural change putin later replied all three were listed by sergei shoigu continue the cbo until it task are completed the russian group of troop must maintain peace in nagorno karabakh and syria to increase the number of serviceman under the contract taking into account the replacement of mobilized citizen in the group of troop and the recruitment of new formation by the end of the year to thousand people if in february the appropriate action had not been taken on our part everything would have been the same only from the worst position for u the situation in ukraine ha been brought by her so called friend to the point where it ha become deadly for russia and suicidal for the ukrainian people themselves and we see this even in the nature of the fighting it is simply amazing what is happening there a if ukrainian do not exist at all they are thrown into the furnace and that s it putin said at the end of the open part of the board they the west ed pursued their interest weakened and tore historical russia apart and today continuously supplying weapon to ukraine transferring mercenary there they are absolutely ruthless to it citizen at their expense they promote their geopolitical goal which have nothing to do with the interest of the ukrainian people also aimed at weakening disintegrating destroying russia he added in the end the president assured that he did not plan to militarize the economy the improvement of the armed force will take place calmly and rhythmically the state will fulfill all social obligation we have it all all the opportunity to build your potential we will certainly do this without any discount and unlike many other country on it own scientific technological production and personnel base the head of the country assured listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year the u s and it ally spend heavily on information warfare with russia at the same time the war crime of the ukrainian troop are hushed up russian defense minister sergei shoigu said in his report at the final board of the military department with the participation of russian president vladimir putin the minister stressed that the information and psychological impact is conducted not only against russia but also against it ally we have fully understood what the supposedly free western press is every day on the command from washington thousand of fake about the event in ukraine are published according to the same template shoigu said adding that to solve this problem hundred of tv channel print medium outlet and medium resource are working for the kiev regime according to the minister the western medium are mostly silent about the war crime of the armed force of ukraine at the same time glorifying the kiev regime and neo nazi the terrorist method of the armed force of ukraine are presented a legitimate self defense or are presented a action of russian unit ukrainian nationalist took on the role of barrage squad every day we receive data on the execution of serviceman of the armed force of ukraine who evade combat mission it should be noted that in the network you can even find footage of shooting by barrage detachment of ukrainian serviceman which wa removed from a drone what else drew attention to the board minister in ukraine the russian military is opposed by the combined force of the west more than u and nato satellite work in the interest of the armed force including more than military nato staff officer are in the combat zone in ukraine more than country have spent billion on arm supply to ukraine some of the weapon are in the hand of terrorist and are spreading around the world the revelation of merkel and poroshenko

employed across ukraine to kill the enemy spy on it formation and guide bomb to their target but this month the ukrainian military began a program to use drone in a more unusual role to guide russian soldier who want to surrender the program had it genesis in late november when the ukrainian military released footage of a russian soldier throwing his weapon to the ground raising his hand and nervously following a path set out by a drone overhead leading him to soldier from the ukrainian army s th mechanized brigade a few week later the ukrainian general staff released an instructional video explaining how russian soldier can surrender to a ukrainian drone and it is now part of a wide ranging effort by ukraine to persuade russian soldier to give up the program called i want to live includes a phone hotline a website and a telegram channel all dedicated to communicating to russian soldier and their family it s too early to know whether the drone effort will lure russian deserter in any meaningful number but it add another avenue for ukraine to recruit russian deserter this one with a distinctly modern twist to the age old tactic of informational warfare and if nothing else it may further the erosion of russian morale on the battlefield russian defeat have already provided an opening for ukraine to exploit that low morale especially in the month after the kremlin s september mobilization which ha sent thousand of new recruit into fierce battle with little training and scant supply petro yatsenko a spokesman for ukraine s coordination headquarters for treatment of prisoner of war said in an interview monday that ukraine ha had more than direct request for information on how to surrender through the i want to live program it is not possible to independently verify the claim mr yatsenko said the military would not release information about the number of russian in ukrainian captivity for security reason andriy yusov who represents the intelligence department in ukraine s ministry of defense said ukraine had received million inquiry about the program since it wa set up on sept most of the query are coming from russia he said and the vast majority involved appeal from people who are studying for themselves or their relative the possibility of saving life in the bloody and unjust war for the past ten month both russia and ukraine have engaged in robust informational campaign targeting enemy soldier with leaflet social medium post radio appeal text message and television campaign all dedicated to convincing them to surrender in may when the russian were laying waste to town and city and beginning to gobble up land in eastern ukraine not all the gun were loaded with explosive some soviet era self propelled howitzer had shell set up to explode in the air and scatter leaflet over ukrainian controlled territory according to zvezda a russian state owned nationwide tv network run by the russian ministry of defense we give the last warning to the ukrainian nazi to surrender an artilleryman named vadim told the station more recently the russian announced that it drone operator were sending sm message to ukrainian mobile phone subscriber telling them to lay down their arm there s no evidence russia s text to surrender drone have had any impact the ukrainian campaign ha featured both high tech and low tech mean of communicating artillery unit routinely use vampire multiple launch rocket system to fire projectile filled with leaflet each across russian position hanna malyar a ukrainian deputy minister of defense said this wa one way to give russian occupier one last chance to yield themselves when there wa no internet connection otherwise the only thing that awaits them on the ukrainian land is death she said mr yatsenko the spokesman for the prisoner of war group said that ukrainian were also giving captured russian soldier who are released a part of prisoner of war exchange e card with information about how to surrender that way he said if they are thrown back into the fight they know how to give themselves up when ukraine capture russian soldier it sends them to prisoner of war camp the main one is in the northwest near lviv ukraine ha allowed some tightly controlled medium visit inside that camp they also allow routine visit from the international committee of the red cross the most far reaching ukrainian effort is the i want to live program which includes a telegram channel in russian that now ha more than subscriber mainly in russia or russian controlled territory phone operator also work around the clock at an undisclosed location in kyiv taking up to call daily mr yatsenko said but just a surrendering wa considered one of the most dangerous act on the battlefield of the first world war the same is true in ukraine today with a frontline sprawling over hundred of mile and the land between the trench a treacherous wasteland of mine watched over by sniper and subject to near constant bombardment arranging a surrender present danger for all involved that is where drone come in the surrender that wa caught on the video released in november and geo located by military analyst to the eastern donbas region wa an accident of sort mr yatsenko said it wa not planned and the fact that it worked with all the possible thing that could have gone wrong made the ukrainian military think that it wa an idea that could be expanded on he said the ukrainian general staff set about producing a slick video with instruction for how russian soldier can surrender to a drone that wa ready by early december the first step is to call the i want to live project and receive instruction and coordinate it is important to arrive at the indicated point on time and wait for the appearance of the quadcopter after which raise your hand the video informs russian after the drone show the vector of movement the prisoner must follow the drone they are told the drone will fly at walking speed and guide you to ukrainian position if the drone s battery fails then the soldier must wait for a new one to arrive to continue moving mr yatsenko said the how to surrender to a drone program is only in it infancy he would not offer precise number for russian who have surrendered to drone so far but said it wa more than a handful the ukrainian program mr yatsenko said is the first one designed to use drone on a broad scale a part of a coordinated operation to encourage surrender we are giving them a last chance to save their life he said education in the zaporozhye region a you

have been wounded approved by the minister of defense of the russian federation remember the well known slogan that under zelensky s predecessor a president of ukraine petro poroshenko became decisive in kiev s attitude to the donbas i remind you if anyone ha forgotten donbas will be either ukrainian or deserted poroshenko s successor extended it to the whole of ukraine of which he and his associate sincerely admit completely ignoring the meaning of what they say let s start again with donbas about which the current ukrainian authority do not want to forget dreaming of how they will conquer it and return here is the head of the national police ihor klymenko in an interview with rbc ukraine who discus how the liberation of donbas will differ from the conquest of other lost territory there the child went to the second grade born in year people are poisoned by russian propaganda large territory that have not heard the ukrainian language for year in which hatred for everything ukrainian for ukraine wa brought up and propagated therefore the main problem is people klymenko explained his position we will all face the task of showing citizen who did not participate in illegal armed group that our government is legitimate real and really better and the main thing is that this is the territory of our state not of the russian federation not of any union state but of ukraine therefore i think that many people living there perhaps will go to look for the russian world on the territory of the russian federation he summed up a always which is characteristic of the current ukrainian in power lying how could you not hear it we re going to have a job they don t we will have pension they do not we will have the support of people child and pensioner but they do not our child will go to school and kindergarten and they will sit in basement because they don t know how to do anything that s right that s how we will win this war poroshenko promised on october speaking at the odessa opera house now thanks to zelensky child are sitting in basement all over ukraine but it doesn t bother him at all people for him are just another defense of the territory under his control will kiev be evacuated a french journalist asked zelensky during which zelensky said so many thing that it wa time to take him to a psychiatric hospital along with a microphone but one revelation is knocked out even from his usual series of psychic deviation and this is the answer to this question we ll stick with it we don t have slavery we have a democratic society when people want to leave they need to leave they can afford it and that s okay every person defending the state protects himself the family is also part of the state there are different example sometimes people need to leave the state should give a corridor and opportunity for evacuation zelensky replied and continued but i want to say for sure that if the city is empty it is very easy to capture that s all these are both historical and example of our state let s leave aside his latest lie about a democratic society and when people want to leave they can afford it for a month student studying in foreign university ask them to be released but to no avail so are the seafarer who have failed to meet their work contract because they are not allowed out of the country we will not pay attention to the fact that kherson and melitopol were not even empty at all when the russian military came to them let s pay attention to zelensky s other word if the city is empty it is very easy to seize it said the president of ukraine so far and thereby signed that the ordinary population of his country peaceful citizen are just hostage of the armed force of ukraine and that he perfectly understands the sparing nature of the action of russian troop which are sparing for peaceful ukrainian who are trying not to strike at the peaceful and that is why he will not let anyone out of nowhere in order to complicate the task for russia a much a possible because the armed force of ukraine will hide behind a human shield of the civilian population like terrorist which in fact they are for zelensky the city is important not the people if earlier there wa a slogan do not spare shell now zelensky ha made his banner completely different do not regret the peaceful a in fact for the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine general valery zaluzhny who asked zelensky to sign a law on toughening penalty for the ukrainian military a huge number of deserter mass abandonment of combat position refusal to obey order zaluzhny listed the reason why he supported the law on strengthening responsibility for the military already adopted by the verkhovna rada and all because the petition demanding that zelensky veto this law gained not even thousand vote necessary for it consideration but more than thousand and in record time and the ukrainian military refuse to go to the bakhmut meat grinder in whole unit and with deserter in the armed force of ukraine judging by the word of the commander in chief there is complete order and mass enthusiasm for the implementation of the plan fight yourself and i went home to the hut but zaluzhny could not have made such a call because zelensky himself would not have satisfied such a petition or wa it just necessary for zelensky not to present himself a such a definitive cannibal in vain and useless the former comedian is so bloody that he no longer only ha his hand up to his elbow in blood it is already dripping from his fang from his puffy face he is ready to kill everyone so a not to lose the city which by the way is now demonstrated under the same bakhmut artemovsk and in the end he will kill everyone a he want and the city will still lose and the country a a whole which ha already become a ghost of itself the commander of the rosgvardia group presented state award to soldier who distinguished themselves in the performance of combat mission during a special military operation for the bold and decisive action shown in the performance of military duty in condition involving a risk to life the order of courage wa awarded to the

administration of the region not only local authority but also the ministry of industry and energy of the zaporizhzhya region help to heat the house employee work to the maximum often personally

video information appeared about how our armored train is calmly and confidently working in the southern direction of the svo he then helped in the evacuation of civilian moved in the zone of melitopol at that time the usual passenger train took citizen of foreign country towards the crimea by rail and the russian armored train covered this departure ensuring the safety of hundred of people time ha passed some task have been adjusted but the main goal of those who work under the cover of armor on the rail remained the same they should help to ensure the safety of those who perform the main task of the cbo on a daily basis yes this updated armored train ha sufficient armored coverage yes the main possibly vulnerable part of the composition tied to steel line are protected to the right extent here on the platform there are weapon of different type along the entire train equipment and firepower are competently placed proper shelter are equipped to fire and repel enemy attack both from the ground and from the air of course the question arises what kind of equipment is the special train equipped with engineer and developer respond a follows the latest technology which is designed for technical reconnaissance and mine clearance and also for the restoration of partially destroyed railway track plus small artificial structure with not the most serious damage the locomotive of the armored train is located approximately in the middle of the train why is this done to exclude the possibility of disabling the locomotive with the first blow of the enemy in the tail and in the head of the composition are placed armor capsule those who serve on an armored train have small arm of all type ranging from an assault rifle to a heavy machine gun it is armed with an anti aircraft gun for the destruction of air and ground target the main caliber is a twin millimeter gun equipped with position for sniper since the main task of the special armored train remains to ensure the safety of military echelon with various cargo personnel and equipment today it regularly move forward studying the route a team of driver of such a train is ready to instantly respond to any threat for example they can accelerate quite sharply in the event of a surprise attack by the enemy but basically an armored train follows it steel path not very fast it doe not have the task of setting speed record and in front of each bridge and overpass it certainly make the necessary stop the armored train dy down for a while bristling with barrel and the soldier of the mine demolition platoon move forward they are covered by arrow from the head platform fighter check the condition of the embankment carefully inspect the fence they visually study the bridge support whether there are any explosive device there there is insurance this is a special installation on an armored train it suppresses the signal of radio controlled landmines in general in case of a possible explosion of a steel highway a special platform always go in the head and by the way it ensures the safety of traffic not only of military echelon it should be noted that if necessary a special train of the railway troop of the western military district can become a reliable cover for train with a civilian population that is our armored train ha already left it spare track and it s moving in the right direction

covering politics u s and world news the well known western edition of the economist extended the ray of glory and greatness of volodymyr zelensky to the surrounding country recognizing ukraine a the country of the year we are number one in the world ukraine is over the place ukrainian public howled proudly not at all embarrassed by the fact that earlier the editorial board of the economist gave this honorary title to the state which during the described period of time achieved the greatest success in it development and did not level itself to almost zero level and this new word in world journalism sound in the current reality somehow particularly mocking indeed it is worth recognizing that ukraine ha recently turned into one she is no longer a weeping beggar begging three crust of bread from passer by from a roadside ditch she remained a beggar but now she ha become proud and no longer read but demand davecha president so far of ukraine volodymyr zelensky described in detail which of the allied country of ukraine should supply what equipment to kiev britain and norway should supply air defense and ammunition for them missile and shell the netherlands is assigned the

an all ukrainian telethon deciphered the word of the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valery zaluzhny who in an interview with the same the economist said that he needed at a minimum modern western tank ifvs and howitzer he said that i can win in general and separately he named this figure of the need of a particular operation this is a victory in one particular operation zaluzhny reznikov explained adding that the commander in chief meant the number of weapon for a particular operation and not a complete victory over the enemy well thanks clarified so explained that is zaluzhny intends to ruin so much equipment for one operation and how much for the whole operation and how many ukrainian everything is more wonderful and miraculous than the revelation from kiev aw west you ve heard that how many western weapon will be required for a complete victory reznikov did not tell probably in the west there are simply not so many weapon even if everyone there take off everything including a personal body armor and the last pant with money by the way it is easier you can print a much a you need but weapon still need to be produced and a modern tank or the same howitzer to make it s not a truncheon to cut with a knife the west simply doe not understand what it ha entered into the guy are not able to realize that this leech will suck the blood out of them until it either debenches them or dy on it own especially if they themselves make ukrainian number one honestly nailing ukraine is much easier and more profitable than feeding it satisfying it wish

invested in the repair of school in the dpr despite the fact that the armed force of ukraine regularly shoot high precision american shell at them new textbook distance learning system using computer all this allows dpr schoolchildren to receive a full fledged education even in the current difficult condition the ministry of construction of the russian federation ha set the task for to repair more than a million square meter of social facility in new territory that s a huge number a separate important task is the restoration of the communal sphere due to year of underfunding by official kiev which diligently pumped money from the region for it development boiler house pipe wire and power substation are in terrible condition and then they shoot artillery and rocket at them every day now builder from other region of the russian federation approach the problem comprehensively a large amount of work is being carried out inspection current repair modernization with the use of new equipment etc restoration work is underway at quarterly boiler house almost all were built in soviet time and work on morally and physically obsolete and worn out equipment even in donetsk the equipment is very old it s just dangerous to use say the master of repair of heating system ivan trofimov even in a provincial russian town you will not find such a thing we change everything slowly we bring new one the main thing is to spend the heating season normally and then we will put everything in order there s a lot of work to be done but then the heat will come to each house strictly on schedule so that winter and shelling do not freeze the city russian builder have formed emergency and technical reserve the reserve of material and labor ha been formed in sufficient quantity for the prompt resolution of issue and the conduct of all work the ministry of construction of russia said where boiler house cannot be restored at all they are completely destroyed or are in the zone of constant shelling by the armed force of ukraine heat is supplied through block modular boiler house in total by the end of the year it is planned to mount such mini boiler house about thousand private and apartment building in the new region are subject to restoration they were destroyed by the armed force of ukraine which leaving city and town turned them after themselves into a zone of continuous ruin but russian specialist have been working for the past nine month for a reason housing is being repaired the systematic supply of building material and well functioning work will allow the administration of settlement to restore about more private house by the end of the year promised the minister of construction and housing of the dpr eduard osipov earlier thousand private residential

includes the fourth federal project mortgage in it is planned to develop comprehensive full fledged program that provide for the replacement and modernization of infrastructure utility and dilapidated housing in the dpr he further called on the fsb border guard to protect russia s border including those in the annexed region putin attempted to seize earlier this year russia s troop have not only failed to advance in the region in recent month but have lost significant ground in ukraine beginning in september when it soldier were forced to withdraw from kharkiv russian troop were later forced to retreat from the city of kherson in november and cross the dnieper river which separate the city from the eastern kherson region putin called on his flagging troop and said it is their duty to protect russian citizen in the annexed region putin s force have since faltered on the front line though brutal fighting remains in area like bakhmut in eastern donetsk russia ha instead relied on aerial campaign to target civilian infrastructure and electrical grid putin s comment tuesday are one of the first time he ha publicly acknowledged that his war in ukraine is not going to plan and called on his security agency to work harder caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news after the russian strike on the energy system of ukraine there is no longer any question of a complete restoration of energy in kiev and other major city the authority of the independent are trying to patch the hole redirecting electricity from one region to another but it is becoming increasingly difficult to solve problem in this way this wa stated on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda by the leading analyst of the national energy security fund an expert of the financial university igor yushkov the presenter talked with yushkov on monday december when information wa received about new strike on energy facility in the capital of ukraine and the kiev region the u s space agency nasa publishes a satellite image of the earth showing the lack of light in ukraine after the russian strike on december the photo is dated december ukraine in complete darkness igor valeryevich what do they have time to restore in the same kiev in general is it possible to restore anything or talk of eliminating the consequence these are just word attempt by mayor klitschko to calm people down of course this is also an attempt to calm the townspeople information reach the ukrainian population in a measured manner because the kiev authority cannot say yes everything ha been bombed in our country there is nothing left this will immediately cause panic so they say everything is fine now we will restore everything and then at the next strike even if they were inflicted not on the infrastructure but on some other object the population is given the following portion of information here we have an accident and here that is information about the volume of damage and what will be the heat supply water supply energy supply will be conveyed to the public gradually at the same time it is quite clear that the accumulated effect of the blow of a very large blow it will no longer be possible to fully restore the infrastructure rather it make sense to talk about whether it will be possible to maintain at least some schedule for the supply of energy supply whether it will be possible to maintain heat supply and so on even in kiev in many area it is rather a question of whether the population will be able to spend at least a few hour a day with electricity or all electricity will have to be given exclusively for infrastructure for the operation of the water utility sewerage and most importantly heat supply that is it will not be possible to fully restore energy supply on the scale of kyiv and the region there is nothing to think about now the authority are trying somewhere to ensure the flow from neighboring region where possible but there are fewer and fewer such opportunity they are also trying to supply diesel generator to the same water utility and heat supply system the situation is exacerbated by the fact that it ha become colder and energy need are becoming more and more therefore of course the situation for kiev is getting worse and worse by the light yes we see picture from space a dark spot and what do they have with the gas we have seen only one blow to the facility of the gas industry in ukraine in one of the wave of strike there were attack aimed at gas infrastructure in the kharkiv region but otherwise the gas industry is not the target of russian attack in this regard the gas balance in ukraine may gradually converge because at the beginning of the year their consumption wa billion cubic meter per year and their own production wa billion cubic meter now production there is practically stopped there is almost no industry a a consumer de facto so they can come to the point that consumption will fall to the very billion cubic meter that they produce they will be self sufficient it certainly doesn t make it any easier for them but maybe they ll somehow pa it off a their own achievement however there is a nuance gas production is concentrated mainly in the kharkiv region and in the west of ukraine near the border and the question is whether they will be able to deliver gas for example from western ukraine throughout the territory speaking of gas the european union writes that it will discus reducing the estimated limit of gas price to euro per megawatt hour what doe that mean people are trying to slow down the market economy indeed they created these exchange for decade and told u that the fairest price is there they even forced gazprom to rewrite contract with all european company so that the link wa not to the cost of oil but to the price of gas on those very exchange and now they say you know we don t like it when it s expensive on the stock exchange so we re going to set the maximum level that we re willing to pay but for them the main risk is that now they will mean a low ceiling in europe and in asia price will rise and all tanker will turn around and go to asia because it is more profitable to sell there they are afraid of this so they cannot agree for a week here by the way it is very important that we are not talking about russian gas but about gas in general that is these are not sanction against russia this is precisely an instrument of european influence on the market and that scare them now you will begin to interfere in the market company will not like it everyone who can go to asian market and it turn out that you like wanted gas to be cheaper but in reality you will get an even greater deficit listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the website of the kp ru publishes online the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on december fighter of the viking group destroyed the stronghold of foreign mercenary near marinka the armed force of ukraine shelled the kuibyshev and kiev district of donetsk with artillery militant fired five mm shell at two district of donetsk and an air alert wa announced in most region of ukraine on december alarm sounded in region of ukraine russian troop destroyed six sabotage group of the armed force of ukraine in the zone of the special operation four sabotage group were destroyed in the krasnolimansky direction russian troop struck the point of deployment of the group of the center of special operation south of the armed force of ukraine also the russian armed force defeated enemy artillery unit in firing position the russian army took more advantageous position in the donetsk direction the russian military thwarted attempt by militant to conduct reconnaissance by combat a video of the discovery of a cache of nato weapon wa shown by kadyrov the military found hundred of weapon and detained accomplice of the armed force of ukraine listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year the temperature in ukraine s capital kyiv recently dropped to degree and ukrainian are freezing a russian airstrikes are pounding the country s vital infrastructure cutting off electricity and heat and depriving them of drinking water but general frost on which the russian have relied for century to help defeat the country s enemy ha also turned it weapon against president vladimir putin s soldier the russian force who have been fighting on putin s order against their slavic brother for month are reportedly dying from hypothermia because their uniform no longer hold up to severe eurasian winter the fiasco stem from several odd decision made by the post soviet military leadership and by putin himself the soviet red army uniform wa a poor man s version of the imperial russian army dress from the th century in the run up to world war ii when russia had the largest army in europe approximately million soldier moscow prioritized low cost but effective couture compared to the pompous flashy design favored by the czarist general the uniform wa practical with no frill other than a bright distinctive insignia worn by senior officer that made them easy target for german marksman the winter wear included a greatcoat or half length fur coat a cap with ear flap and thick felt wool valenki footwear worn by the russian military and civilian alike for hundred of year designed for extreme russian winter the uniform helped the russian force beat the french in and the german in napoleon bonaparte admitted that the russian winter wa largely responsible for the disintegration of his army many of hitler s lightly clad nazi troop also froze to death an exception wa the officer field cap that proudly sported a new russian national symbol the double headed eagle which the soldier dubbed mutated chicken igor sergeyev who rose to defense minister in under yeltsin but wa fired by putin in made russian military dress look like that of the u s army and anatoliy serdyukov who wa also fired by putin ordered winter uniform to be slim and tailored but the biggest uproar in the rank erupted after the radical change made by a famous fashion designer valentin yudashkin known for his theatrical style yudashkin s evening gown are displayed in the metropolitan museum of art in new york the california museum of fashion in los angeles and the museum of fashion and textile in paris service member complained that the uniform wa made of cheap synthetic material making them too hot in summer it pocket were too small and didn t fit a mobile phone or identification paper and other document velcro patch fell off button disappeared within two week stitching came apart and color faded after a couple of wash the uniform wa also inappropriate for combat because it made a rustling sound with movement and melted in fire most importantly the designer uniform wa also too flimsy for russian winter because instead of natural textile like cotton linen and wool it wa made of new high tech material the russian soldier joked that at minus celsius they started jumping up and down to keep warm and at minus they couldn t wait for the enemy to shoot them to spare them from freezing to death putin s current defense minister banned yudashkin s invention the minute he assumed his post in prompting the famed fashionista to blame the russian military authority for playing dolce gabbana rather than following his design recommendation current russian defense minister sergei shoigu made a series of his own innovation since shoigu ha no military experience himself he didn t want to visually appear a being outranked by his army men shoigu introduced the limit to the number of medal worn on the ceremonial military dress to allowing only those earned in combat until then russian serviceman participating in military parade on red square decorated themselves with several dozen medal arranged in four or five row that didn t fit on their chest many of them civilian and therefore meaningless the most radical change to the russian uniform wa introduced by putin himself in september by presidential decree putin banned the famous russian military papakha headdress which wa worn by russian and previously soviet general and high ranking office made of the fur skinned from day old baby lamb of a special breed called karakul these hat kept the russian general warm because the fur bristle were thick densely set and water repellant but putin and shoigu chose to replace the papakhas with much le costly cap made of rabbit fur with the vain russian military brass having prioritized style and copying the west over functionality in the post soviet uniform it is hardly surprising that their force are shivering to death a winter set in on the battlefield while the troop look dapper during the famous russian military parade pleasing putin and his lieutenant they are making good looking corp too rebekah koffler is the president of doctrine strategy consulting a former dia intelligence officer and the author of putin s playbook russia s secret plan to defeat america follow her on twitter rebekah according to the telegram channel of the russian ministry of defense the head of the army sergei shoigu last weekend made an inspection directly in the zone of a special military operation according to the military department the minister made most of the test visit in the cvo zone by helicopter judging by a very brief video shoigu flew over the forward position and at that time he received oral report on the state of affair in this zone of action of russian troop it wa about the situation in the southern group later the minister talked with

defense stressed that the closest attention of the head of the russian military department during this inspection wa paid to the comprehensive support of the military grouping sergei shoigu wa able to see in what condition the personnel participating in the battle serve the minister saw how well the fighter were provided with everything they needed and how well the work of medical care and rear

during a trip to the luhansk people s republic press secretary of the ldpr faction alexander dupin said we adjusted the route due to the fact that high precision weapon were working at that time we have taken all measure to avoid unnecessary risk about his word during the conference the air defense system worked a couple of time the rumble from the explosion of air defense missile drowned out the speaker but the main thing that in the end did not drown out the national company energoatom reported that the production of nuclear energy in ukraine wa reduced including due to the restriction of the operation of two of the nine nuclear power unit currently operating in ukraine today they work normally but problem with consumer it is difficult for them now there are problem with substation transformer power line but it s nothing it will pa listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year the russian soldier wa named dmitri tsvigun a table tennis coach from a small city in siberia he had volunteered to fight in ukraine but at age he died from shrapnel wound when a tank shell exploded near him in ukraine s eastern donetsk province on nov he responded to a call from his heart to join the special military operation said a short memorial article in a local newspaper on dec that brief account got mr tsvigun added to a list of confirmed russian war death maintained by a small dedicated team of data journalist and volunteer a the kremlin ha largely avoided updating the number publicly run by mediazona the independent russian news outlet with the bbc s russian service and about a dozen anonymous volunteer in russia the list pull information from source like newspaper article photograph on tombstone fellow soldier mourning their comrade and even tip from relative who want their loved one included in the tally the list ha surpassed name including more than russian drafted recently if the russian government doe not count russian casualty then someone ha to do it said david frenkel one of four data reporter from mediazona running the project it is important for u to explain to russian the cost of the war he added if they do not understand the cost from the picture of devastated ukrainian city then maybe the number of dead russian will make them think about it the russian government ha tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of ukraine on feb it ha updated the number exactly twice once at the end of march and again in september when the defense minister sergei k shoigu said that russian troop had been killed since the war started that official number is notably smaller than estimate from western military and intelligence official gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chief of staff for example said in november that moscow s casualty were well over russian soldier killed and wounded there have been similar estimate for ukrainian loss with mykhailo podolyak a senior adviser to president volodymyr zelensky telling a ukrainian news station this month that up to ukrainian troop had died in the conflict with so much fog of war shrouding the subject mediazona decided that online sleuthing wa needed to establish a baseline of russian death a scattered group of volunteer in russia wa already trying to document the death on their own and the bbc news russian service had done several article on the subject so they combined force they did not set out to document every death and estimated that their russian count wa about one third to half the true total but by harvesting a much information a wa available from social medium post and putting a name to every death listed they figured their number wa better than an estimate it is not just about the number it is about who died or how they died said maxim litavrin another data journalist at mediazona ukrainian upload a higgledy piggledy stream of information about russian killed in the war on several channel on the telegram messaging application including the name of the deceased the team of volunteer investigator in russia then search social medium post for the name all the information from open source end up on a huge spreadsheet the journalist work quickly to check the link and to back up everything because personal post often disappear they crosscheck name against a government website that list people deceased throughout russia but that doe not specify military death seven out of confirmation come from local news report the data journalist said while the others are a mix they include announcement from local official or employer individual post on vkontakte the russian equivalent of facebook and source like picture of memorial plaque put up in dead soldier former school every two week mediazona crunch all the number to break down the toll on it website including death by region military unit and age the result can vary drastically by region in dagestan russia for example where serving and dying in the russian army is considered an honor official tend to make statement about those killed in some region like krasnodar volunteer have counted hundred of war dead by visiting cemetery even temporary tombstone in russian cemetery usually include a picture of the deceased along with the name military unit date of birth and date of death cemetery give u a lot mr frenkel said military analyst have mixed view on the project some prefer to work with estimate of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying pattern the project is a useful snapshot of the breakdown and wider pattern in russian loss said karolina hird a russia analyst at the washington based institute for the study of war we know that russian authority are simply not presenting truthful reporting on loss one early pattern for example showed that about percent of russia s war death were officer that told u a lot about how the russian army operates said olga ivshina a reporter with the bbc russian service who alternate with mediazona each week to tally the number it turned out that senior russian officer were initially deployed near the front line because junior officer could not issue order the information available online varies widely a local community page posted picture showing alexander a dementov and alexander trokhov after they were drafted at the end of september they were both worker at the nadezhdinski metallurgical plant in serov a russian city in the urals then a local newspaper reported on dec that both men who had served in the th motorized rifle brigade died in a missile strike on nov sometimes the detail are sparse vsevolod matveev wa no on the spreadsheet the data journalist discovered that he wa from the sverdlovsk region in the urals and that he wa buried on dec in the town of zarechny from his picture they could tell that he had served with a motorized infantry unit but that wa it when death cannot be confirmed by open source the name are put on a side list awaiting further detail the mediazona reporter noted that resistance to the war in afghanistan and chechnya developed in tandem with the death toll but there ha been little sign of that in russia spending every day scrolling through information about dead people is mentally taxing they said but certain post stick with them mr litavrin remembers reading about a year old man who had a quiet regular life and a daughter and volunteered in august he wa killed after two week on the battlefield i wondered what he wa thinking mr litavrin said it s terrible in the city of ukraine they began to put christmas tree on the square in kiev this year the main decoration of the city wa a meter artificial beauty which wa dressed in the color of the ukrainian flag with garland of dark blue and yellow of course compared to last year s natural meter forest beauty the current one look pale moreover the backlight which is powered by the generator will not be supplied all the time but at certain hour the top of the christmas tree wa decorated with the coat of arm of ukraine and at the bottom were placed the flag of country that help kiev however in comparison with the christmas tree in nikolaev the capital s spruce can be considered a masterpiece the authority of nikolaev simply threw a camouflage net on the monument to st nicholas and called the resulting structure a christmas tree true the townspeople of nikolaev themselves considered that the design is more like a giant sloppy pile of garbage than a christmas tree a stunning discovery wa made by resident of the village of kochanivka okhtyrka district sumy region going through the water to the local well they were very surprised when scooping up from the well they pulled up a bucket with oil conscious citizen signaled to the environmental inspectorate and the expert who arrived confirmed the presence in the well of a viscous liquid of dark color with the smell of oil further result will be known from the result of laboratory test most likely we are talking about the breakthrough of any pipeline which wa laid nearby it is possible that some illegal tie in ha leaked in the meantime the villager are scratching their head over another problem where to get water for drinking and household need federal chancellor of germany olaf scholz once again said that germany will not unilaterally provide ukraine with modern western tank that are in service with the bundeswehr we adhere to three clear principle first we support ukraine to the best of our ability second we prevent a direct confrontation between nato and russia and thirdly there will be no unilateral action on the part of germany scholz announced in general such a cow is needed by yourself well olaf now expect new insult from kiev from andriy melnyk who left there however in berlin he wa replaced a ambassador of ukraine by no le rude according to the well known american newspaper washington post zelensky s team without advertising it initiative in the public space proposed that western government finance direct cash payment to ukrainian citizen it wa about per person per month according to kiev s calculation such financing of the population of ukraine would cost the west billion in six month a the source told wp in surprise for a reason unknown to them the initiative for some reason met with a cold reception from western official about the same a bankova s proposal to fifa that zelensky make a video appeal before the final match of the world cup which end in qatar i wonder why even more interestingly even here zelensky and his adviser tried to deceive the west a simple calculation show that they provided data on the residence of million people in ukraine although the real population is now unlikely to be much more than half of this figure hardly anyone think that zelensky will pay ukrainian twice a much a promised and then it turn out that someone wanted to pocket half of the amount the influential american newspaper the new york time reported that washington failed to prevent kiev s assassination attempt on the chief of the general staff of the russian armed force valery gerasimov when the american became aware of gerasimov s impending visit to the zone of the special military operation they did not share this information with the ukrainian side but kiev still learned about gerasimov s plan and then washington began to dissuade the ukrainian leadership from an assassination attempt on it in order to prevent the possibility of a war between the united state and russia we told them not to do that a senior u s official told reporter we said hey that s too much but in response the ukrainian military informed the american that they had already launched an attack on the alleged location of the general gerasimov wa not there but u s official said several russian were killed in the strike according to the estonian national broadcasting thousand of people are dismissed every month in the republic and although general unemployment is growing by about per month it would seem not such large number this process ha acquired the character of a progressive movement for people who have been reduced this is a great loss and in this one percent about people previously it wa about hundred of people a month said the economist of eesti pank and added that those who work with people and company from russia are the first to fall under the reduction since the main reason for this process are the growing cost of company and sanction against moscow ukrainian civilian doctor face a surge in unemployment this wa told by the head of the public organization social movement vitaly dudin who announced the planned personnel optimization the reason is a decrease in funding thousand of doctor are under threat of layoff dudin predicts chief doctor claim that even salary will not have enough money the budget for medicine is not increasing but inflation is growing therefore there will be not only reduction there is a risk of bankruptcy of many clinic even relatively prosperous medical institution now survive at the expense of humanitarian aid what the state give is barely enough to maintain current expense and salary explained the mechanism of what is happening deputy head of the board of the all ukrainian medical society konstantin nadutyi and this is in condition when the hospital of ukraine are full of wounded and not only civilian hospital but also institution of a completely different orientation are being repurposed for them the swiss authority said that the country on it own initiative join the new eu sanction against russia it seems that the swiss have awakened an appetite for russian asset abroad a part of the new eu sanction even toy drone are banned from supplying russia and they forgot about child s railway ukrainian intelligence said that the next russian strike on the energy sector of ukraine could be timed to coincide with un meeting or day of the week that s a perfectly accurate prediction the next missile strike will necessarily be on some day of the week don t go to grandma the chief judge of the supreme court of norway reported that his wife whom he brought from ukraine tried to poison him his wife natalia year younger than her husband justified herself by the fact that it wa her revenge for the fact that her husband supported russia and putin a if he hadn t been sued the press service of the ukrainian agribusiness club reported that next year the grain harvest in ukraine will decrease by compared to informed source report that part of the western financial assistance for the most part loan is spent on salary and bonus to western mercenary who receive such money that it doe not add sympathy to them from the armed force of ukraine listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year in the face of russian aggression the whole of ukraine a one is united indivisible and somehow else and i remembered ungrounded that is indestructible rich poor old and young all in the same trench true some near maryinka and in artemovsk bakhmut lay down life while others worry about them in paris but everyone in a single impulse

olena zelenskaya the wife of ukrainian president voldemar wa here in paris she went on an important international business to help the christmas tree to dress up the macron couple in the elysee palace and what it is warm dry there is water the light is not cut off it is a sin not to come to such good people and not help them solve the most pressing issue moreover after such pathetic statement that olena made in november that all ukrainian again like one zelensky are ready to endure a year two and three and how much there in general it will be necessary to live without light heat and water if only to someday enter the bright future of the european union with heating electricity and sewerage and that all this wa in the ukrainian themselves it doe not count after that madame zelenskaya even spoke in paris at some forum and asked to send ukraine more diesel and gasoline generator to ukrainian a a gift under the christmas tree but it had no success and unlike her husband who at one time performed the number of the original piano performance immortal in marginal layer did not even receive applause from the audience probably olena wa very upset because she could not organize the delivery of generator to ukraine for free and what doe a girl do in paris where there are so many fashion boutique and shop especially when she s upset that s right she go to shop well olena wa very upset shopping wa unusual for thousand dollar a written by european newspaper translated into ruble this is a little more than million ruble it s strange of course that it s not on the euro but they

olena zelenskaya foundation take it do not deny yourself anything and the bag will still be able to fold the rag or take out the waste product in it when the sewer collapse the right thing in the household will come in handy no maybe you wanted her to buy generator for at least the same buck and the mood after encountering an indifferent world in her is so bad and remains so whatever callous

victory and when to expect it read in the material of alexander kots here on the kp ru meanwhile donetsk ha experienced the most powerful shelling since ukraine is shooting at child hospital and church detail on the kp ru website listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place a huge pathetic and scandalous interview with the respectable a it seemed before magazine the economist wa given by the commander of the ukrainian troop general valeriy zaluzhny from which it is believed the west is preparing a possible successor to volodymyr zelensky in the presidency the interview is also quite frank because some harsh even cruel beyond the limit of human humanism phrase which are sometimes capable of the military but not politician or diplomat are not censored by the editor of the british magazine it turn out that such phrase for the british and western society in general become acceptable or even desirable how do you like such a confession of general zaluzhny for u the military it all began in eight year of struggle until everything that happened on february wa an increase in scale before that we had a front of kilometer and on february this front grew to kilometer all we ve done is apply our knowledge and experience that we ve had since and the most important experience which we professed almost a a religion is that russian and any other enemy should be killed simply killed and most importantly not be afraid to do it and that s what we re doing it s just curious and if zaluzhny instead of kill russian said kill jew or kill negro the british just a calmly printed it further zaluzhny admits that since the beginning of the conflict he ha already dismissed ten ukrainian general another shot himself the commander of the armed force of ukraine say that russian troop correctly planned the start of the special operation but they had limited resource i think they had the resource for three month to achieve their goal zaluzhny said they wanted to take kiev militarily it wa the right decision the easiest way to achieve your goal i would do the same about today s battle and the alignment of force the ukrainian military leader say this the situation in donbas is not easy they russian troop need time to gather resource and build new capability to continue to achieve their goal but they are working on another task in parallel doing everything possible to prevent u from regrouping and striking they are shackling our troop to prevent u from regrouping the fact that they are now fighting hard is of course very bad this exhaust the armed force of ukraine about the tactic and condition of the ukrainian troop zaluzhny say even more striking thing he openly admits that he is throwing soldier to slaughter doe not now provide assistance to those who are still holding back the russian offensive in the donbas and at the same time he is preparing fresh reserve for his future offensive in february just read that the next task that we have is to hold the line and not lose ground anymore because it is ten to fifteen time harder to release than not to surrender our troop are bleeding right now but forgive me soldier in the trench it is now more important to focus on accumulating resource for the longer and heavier fighting that could begin next year our second strategic task is to prepare for the development of the conflict that may occur in february to be able to fight with fresh force and reserve this can happen in february at best in march at worst in late january a british magazine asks zaluzhny about the offensive on crimea which is promised in kiev and he responds actually revealing the probable plan to capture melitopol that to take the crimea in a fire blockade to get to the border of crimea today we need to cover a distance of km to melitopol say the ukrainian general by the way this is enough for u because melitopol would give u full fire control of the land corridor to crimea because from melitopol we can already fire on the crimean isthmus the same himars and so on surely these napoleonic plan are known to the russian general staff and it know how to disrupt them otherwise the ukrainian general would not have blurted them out so easily to journalist zaluzhny also admits that ukraine s energy system is balancing on a fine line i m not an expert on energy but it seems to me that we are on the verge we re balancing on a fine line and if the power grid is destroyed without water light and heat can we talk about the preparation of reserve for the continuation of hostility the ukrainian commander tell a british magazine that he ha enough people i have enough i don t need hundred of thousand more but zaluzhny asks for weapon and equipment we need tank we need apc bmps and we need ammunition i m not talking about the f he also asks for air defense recognizing that nato make all the calculation for the ukrainian nato specialist know everything absolutely everything down to the smallest detail the calculation are done we already have several nasams norwegian american air defense system iris t german air defense system is already in use but we need dozen of those the general is asked have russian troop adapted to himars american multiple rocket launcher yes zaluzhny reply they ve gone a distance unattainable for himars and we don t have anything long range there were also complaint about the greed of the west judging by his word zaluzhny want to fan a conflict in europe on the scale of the first world war and the west from such a prospect faint we are talking about the scale of the first world war this is what anthony radakin the commander of the british troop said to me zaluzhny flaunt but when i told him that the british army had fired a million shell in the first world war and so far only had been sent to u he replied we will lose europe we won t have anything to live on if you fire so many shell when people talk about shell people counting money faint but with such resource i cannot conduct new large operation although we are now working on one zaluzhny mysteriously intrigue it s on the way but you can t see it yet i need resource i need tank ifvs howitzer the general give specific figure and promise if he is given all this to reach the border on february but i get le than i need and we have to seize a lot more territory well at the end the economist asked zaluzhny what he thought about partial mobilization in russia the russian mobilization ha worked the ukrainian general is forced to admit it s not true that their problem are terrible that these people won t fight they will they are a problem for u listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place the strike on the independent on friday

diesel go there are a lot of them a long time ago after we began to knock out their traction substation they began to pull up these diesel engine removing them from non electrified road to transport troop to the east these spare diesel locomotive are actively used right now and we don t know the number of diesel locomotive that ukrainian use that is these strike did not interrupt the supply of ukrainian troop by rail unfortunately no in term of the density of railway ukraine wa the richest of all the union republic of the ussr both in density and in length and they have no problem moving from one road to another if there s a craving and bridge well if they have more than undamaged bridge across the dnieper so what do we want and the soviet experience of rail warfare and countering it the experience wa serious if the station is a junction or a first class station there are backup diesel engine with electric generator and you still have an energy management system let s say we knocked out a station that provided energy to a power plant that provided a road well they can switch to wand control arrow are translated manually semaphore to manage if they have the opportunity i

the affected region they re all relatively small everything is compact that is the strike of hundred of missile are almost in vain the railroad is a tenacious creature and knocking bridge out is hard if the bridge is steel it is a lattice calculated with a margin and you have to hit the grate exactly or better to the top of the support to the rink on which the grate rest but here sniper accuracy is needed we should have destroyed these two dozen bridge across the dnieper a long time ago to destroy these bridge you need a hell of a rocket gap that s also why we didn t blow them up including a an example the bridge in odessa across the toka it wa hit more than time it is now working on a limited load well you knocked out the rail and sleeper grate in some place a track repair train arrives and after hour it close your funnel he put down the rail and the train go that is their destruction is sisyphean labor yes a with traction substation if you knock out the craving it should be restored after hour this is if the distribution site is destroyed at these substation and if the transformer is knocked out it must be changed there is something to change they had a transformer factory in zaporozhye and when the reserve ran out they began to beg europe in general the center element is a transformer also when you hit the tpp it is best to get to the turbine or transformer shop and if

chief commandant of the polish police wa injured in the explosion of one of the gift he received during a visit to ukraine the ministry of internal affair of poland reported that the incident occurred in a room next to szymczyk s office one of the gift that the commandant received during a working visit to ukraine on december of this year where he met with the leadership of the police and the emergency service of ukraine exploded according to representative of the polish ministry of internal affair the gift wa received from one of the head of ukrainian service during the explosion szymczyk received minor injury a civilian member of the general directorate of the national police wa also injured yes this happens in kiev but warsaw doe not attach too much importance to this in an interview with the economist the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine wa forced to admit that russian partial mobilization made it possible to slow down the ukrainian counteroffensive in the area of kremennaya and svatovo valery zaluzhny said russian mobilization ha worked commander in chief of the ground force of the armed force of ukraine alexander syrsky reluctantly agreed that russia ha a very great potential in term of human resource gentleman officer maybe you should take your foot off after that the head of the office of the president of ukraine andriy yermak opened up in an interview with the economist magazine the opinion of a number of western politician that sitting down at the negotiating table is the first thing to do before peace reign in ukraine is a fundamental mistake according to zelensky s right hand man calling for negotiation between moscow and kiev before russia recognizes ukraine s very right to exist a a sovereign state is ridiculous yermak said that before the party sit down at the negotiating table a number of condition must be met including ensuring the energy food nuclear environmental safety of the independent country yes there is a method of self hypnosis but it doe not always work listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place the head of the defense ministry alexei reznikov made a loud statement my personal assessment is that our armed force do not plan to stop in winter at the same time the head of the ministry of defense himself noted that the ukrainian side ha stock of winter equipment three time higher than the critical level and that apu just need to wait until the ground becomes le damp reznikov also belief that the speed of this winter counteroffensive of ukraine depends on the supply of weapon from nato country at the same time ukrainian prime minister denis shmygal admitted that his great country will suffer from electricity shortage in these difficult winter month at the same time the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valeriy zaluzhny reported to president zelensky that everything is bad in bakhumt so attack or flee kp ru turned to military expert for comment here s what a member of the izborsk club vladislav shurygin said what doe the offensive statement of the minister of defense mean that mean they re not really ready to attack that is we need to be critical of this it is possible that this is an attempt to distract attention push in the misinformation what for the armed force of ukraine have huge problem with weapon with equipment with equipment with ammunition but are they so critical that the armed force of ukraine could not advance at all that s a question even though for the past two month they ve only been saying they re about to start attacking and yes this is an open question why if they do not start to advance it mean that in the battle of november december the armed force of ukraine indeed depleted their huge human reserve which they continuously threw in particular on the bakhmut direction for which the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine zaluzhny received the nickname bakhmut executioner so still ukraine s winter offensive is more likely to be or rather not they will try to attack locally they don t seem to have the force for a global offensive anymore but they will simply be forced to conduct winter offensive operation they can t sit on the defensive after all it mean to give the initiative to u completely but there are no fool sitting there in the command and here is the opinion of the expert of the association of military political scientist head of the department of political science and sociology of the russian university of economics andrei koshkin for some reason by the beginning of december everyone decided that it wa winter that would bring a pause in hostility but there are no such statement on either our side which would talk about the cessation of hostility for the winter period on the contrary both side are more likely to hear statement that the fighting will continue there are specific of warfare here and this specificity will be taken into account by everyone on the line of combat contact in whose favor doe winter play it depends on the term of the collateral this is not a plus if winter uniform and special equipment cannot fail due to the fact that there are not enough tracked vehicle and civilian transport is used which is not adapted to this they complain that the road are broken and washed away and are waiting for them to freeze if there are no heating point the delivery of hot meal this will not benefit the unit preparing to attack reznikov said that their stock of winter equipment are time higher than the critical level that s what it mean they are waiting for the road to freeze enough to bring the winter reserve but it s more of a political statement there is no need for the military to say this and since the minister of defense say this it mean that there wa a need to launch just such information into a large information field reznikov said that the speed of the offensive will depend on the military supply of the west this is also a political statement it should be a signal to the west if you want u to move advance give u more weapon and equipment on the other hand there is a justification for our society we are not given weapon and therefore we do not advance and in general serious expert come to the conclusion that the armed force of ukraine do not have the resource for significant offensive action expect a paradigm shift listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place resident of the central region of russia collected and donated medicine medical product and basic necessity for hospital in the kherson region employee of rosgvardia assisted in their delivery to their destination the department said the cargo wa taken by the deputy chief physician of the

and exploratory research the armed force of ukraine have been destroying the infrastructure of the lpr for the ninth year utility power line are one of the main target of ukrainian militant if we take into account that the heating main were worn out by percent under ukraine then after the shelling the picture is quite deplorable only in two month ukrainian militant inflicted strike on gas and heat supply facility in the republic and they damaged them therefore builder and communal worker from almost all over the country gathered to help the lpr prepare for the winter equipment for starting

and communal service of the lpr to survive they patch weld repair and repair around the clock day in and day out new brigade were created to quickly eliminate accident on communication i used to work

head of the republic leonid pasechnik in the main part of the republic with the exception of lisichansk severodnetsk rubezhne kremennaya heating ha already been launched work to prepare for the entry into the winter ha been completed by the territory listed by pasechnik remain complex city that are closer to the front and have suffered more from shelling are still more difficult to survive the winter however here everything is being done to provide resident with the necessary utility thus in kremennaya and rubezhne power supply ha been fully restored in severodonetsk partially there are problem with water in these region but they will also be solved said maxim shugaley head of the foundation for the protection of national value recently vladimir putin signed a decree on the creation of a single electronic database of military registration this applies to young people of military age conscript contract soldier and those who are in the reserve why did the head of state and the supreme commander in chief demand that this issue be resolved now the answer is simple the partial mobilization of reserve for a special military operation svo revealed many puncture in the work of the ministry of defense and the general staff in this area the president of the country thus admitted that paper workflow and mean of information processing which are used by military commissariat to account for conscript are hopelessly outdated yes this wa recognized even before the svo by the leadership of the military department itself remember last year s famous visit of the minister of defense of the russian federation to one of the moscow military recruitment office then sergei shoigu not without sarcasm noted that the work with document due to the lack of computer is carried out by grandfatherly guerrilla method when secret report were laid in the hollow the necessary instruction have been given but the amount of work is such that it cannot be shoveled quickly it is necessary to process and clarify the data on almost million people who are included in the so called mobilization reserve therefore everything will be done in stage first in accordance with putin s decree the ministry of defense together with the ministry of digitalization and regional authority is obliged to transfer data on citizen subject to military registration into electronic form by december of this year and then the government of the russian federation within the specified period will approve the stage of the formation of a single state resource determine the operator for each stage the procedure for maintaining the system including the timing of the provision of information such a resource should be created before april reflecting on this problem lawyer dmitry ogorodov asked a reasonable question why ha the ministry of defense not yet created on a modern technical basis a system of military registration provided for by the federal law on military duty and military service the reason are different and very serious back in those day when anatoly serdyukov wa the minister of defense of the russian federation the military department in order to save budget fund sharply lowered the status of military commissariat and reduced their number military enlistment office were dispersed career officer were turned into civil servant many of them did not want to put up with this situation and went either to the troop or to the civilian and those who remained significantly reduced the salary vehicle were taken away from the military enlistment office and in addition budget were also cut money wa not enough not only for computer and copier but also for paper almost all document were filled out manually mountain of paper often gave rise to confusion and error but this of course is not someone s malicious intent but outdated paper information processing technology the lack of up to date information about conscript and reservist in military recruitment office ha caused many problem partial mobilization highlighted them on this occasion the same lawyer dmitry ogorodov said so it came to the point that after the announcement of partial mobilization military enlistment office sent summons to disabled and seriously ill people who were not fit for military service given the task of calling up people some military recruitment office sent summons to mobilizers and the information about them wa often outdated and erroneous such a fan mailing of subpoena to everyone caused unnecessary political irritation in society the lawyer is sure that the creation of such a state information resource is unlikely to harm law abiding citizen who should not be called up disability other ground but evading the draft will become more difficult putin s decree on the creation of a single electronic database of military registration is of great strategic importance for ensuring reliable defense of the state the head of state promptly responded to the problem which wa shown in full growth by partial mobilization and he ordered to create a reliable mechanism for solving this problem it is obvious that the kremlin is closely monitoring all the shortcoming in the army demanding to correct them the president seek to strengthen national security by making it easier for citizen to interact with military recruitment office it requires the executive branch to have an in depth understanding of the quantity and quality of conscription and mobilization human resource all this is done for their effective use in the interest of ensuring the defense of the state this is also done to carry out more effective planned work on the preparation of the necessary number of military trained citizen in the reserve to ensure the transfer of the armed force of the russian federation other troop military formation and body from peacetime to wartime in pursuance of putin s decree the order of the minister of defense of the russian federation no on approval of the instruction on the organization of work to ensure the functioning of the military registration system appeared very quickly this document describes in detail how accounting should be carried out in a new way the goal are defined the objective are clear get to work comrade not only study but proper upbringing and harmonious development such an integrated approach will now be used in working with young people in the zaporizhzhya region taking a a basis the model that wa built in russia at the federal level the authority of the new region created the regional coordination council of the all russian public and state movement of child and youth under the governor of the zaporozhye region the movement of child and youth in the zaporizhzhya region will become a platform that will allow child to develop spiritually and morally have equal opportunity for comprehensive development and self realization and in the future take an active part in the development of the country said the governor of the region yevhen balitsky the work of the public and state movement of child and youth will be supervised by the ministry for youth policy of the administration of the zaporizhzhya region the department ha already shown it professionalism and high quality work with young people in general it s great when there is a system say galina borodenko a year old resident of berdyansk order program and platform on which you can stand firmly on your foot you feel needed important you understand that the state is interested in you and you can realize yourself an example of work with young people in the region can be called the youth forum yugmoloda organized by the youth movement of the same name which took place not so long ago he showed how open young resident of the zaporozhye region are to everything new and interesting how they are drawn to various kind of activity so the first youth forum in berdyansk wa attended by child from the zaporozhye region leading

of our region and integrate them into a single association of youth in russia educating young people is not loud word but real deed the elder show a living example of how to act according to

said anton titsky head of the ministry of youth policy of the zaporizhzhya region kherson ukraine the explosion were audible in the center of kherson a city recently freed from russian occupation a quick check with a ukrainian first response team confirmed that it wa a russian missile attack and that it had targeted a tiny settlement of little or no strategic value on the shore of the broad dnipro river we quickly set off there is a grim monotony to many daily report from the ukraine war a town or village is hit with shell or missile an accounting is made of the dead and wounded usually accompanied by a comment from a local official and the world shrug and move on often oblivious to the terrible impact on family and life the following photograph capture the reality the randomness of death the often life changing violence and suffering visited in one terrible moment that is often overlooked in these attack russia sent half a dozen rocket at the settlement a part of kherson city that day in the immediate aftermath resident rushed to and fro sometimes at a sprint searching for victim helping the wounded and dousing whatever fire raged it seemed like everyone wa on the move it quickly emerged that one person had been killed dmytro dudnyk whose body lay just in the doorway of the house of his mother in law svitlana zubova she had been preparing to make lunch she said and mr dudnyk had just brought her a chocolate bar for them to share over tea after the meal when the rocket slammed into the neighborhood one exploded in her yard knocking mr dudnyk senseless and ultimately killing him a neighbor dashed by with bucket of water to douse the flame of two nearby house he lay in a pool of blood on her floor mr dudnyk worked a a seaman on a cargo ship but his contract wa on hold because of the war he had sent his wife and two daughter and to stay with his parent in the nearby city of mykolaiv just two week earlier a security around kherson deteriorated following the withdrawal of russian troop who began lobbing missile and artillery shell into the area from the other side of the river but he had insisted on staying in kherson to look after the dog and chicken at his home next door to his mother in law s the explosion shattered the morning air with a shocking suddenness his last word were mom here s a chocolate bar for you m zubova said he went out and it exploded before i put the potato in a frying pan two house were on fire on the street a firefighter and ambulance arrived the owner of one house who gave only his first name pavlo wa trying to fix his water bucket a flame licked a hole in the roof neighbor came running to his house with bucket of water while others helped family rescue loved one from damaged home down the street anatoliy anatoliyovych leaned against his neighbor s fence a flame engulfed his home he wa blind he told a firefighter and did not know where his wife wa she had gone to the store just before the shelling he said the firefighter sprayed water on his house until their tank ran dry they asked a resident if there wa a water supply on the street there wa a connection but no running water she said kherson ha been largely without electricity and running water since the russian destroyed much of the city s utility a they retreated a second truck arrived to help but the house wa already gutted at another badly damaged house paramedic carried out a bedridden year old woman lyudmila taking her to a neighbor s house across the street lyudmila wa given the neighbor s daughter s room while her family began photographing the damage to their home for insurance purpose they said back at m zubova s house mr dudnyk s wife and parent arrived from mykolaiv about mile away screaming and weeping a they rushed to his body where it still lay across the threshold his wife wept at his side a his dog circled his foot why why why you his mother iryna screamed at the sky ambulance staff had refused to take him away telling the family they had to call the morgue service i wa asking him to leave his father viktor said even this morning he said i don t want to leave the house dog chicken but who need that all now the police arrived to record the death m zubova rang the number the police gave her for the body collector but the first number didn t work and the person answering the second said they could not travel to kherson then her cellphone ran out of credit eventually a team did show up to remove mr dudnyk s corpse pacing around the yard m zubova kicked bomb debris from the path i don t know what to do now she said how to go on living a the commotion died down the small riverside community seemed an undeserving even senseless target of russian rocket a there were no sign of ukrainian troop in the area but perhaps in this brutal war of indiscriminate russian violence that wa precisely the point bakhmut ukraine wind howled through leafless tree and through the window of the blown out apartment building a the surveillance team marched up flight of stair covered with broken glass the cold numbed their finger a they set up their equipment a laptop size thermal imaging sight it tripod and a starlink satellite dish and battery the job wa straightforward the small team of several men led by an american known a wolf would be ukraine s eye on their battle for bakhmut that night huddling in the soviet style apartment and staring at the white and black glow of infrared image a it tried to identify russian position in front of them wa a panoramic view of bakhmut a city in ukraine s east mostly without power and devastated by six month of concerted shelling russian artillery strike in the distance sent white flash into the sky under a blood red moon rocket arced on the horizon one of the team member powered on the thermal sight and it whirred to life he turned to his colleague who wa fiddling with the satellite dish trying to connect to the internet comms green he asked what unfolded over the next half dozen hour wa a routine but essential part of the daily rhythm of the war part drudgery and part urgent calculation a the team ascertained the coordinate for enemy position relaying them to the ukrainian artillery battery mile away this type of mission observed over the course of two day this month by reporter for the new york time wa a window into how the war is being fought a battle that is relentlessly violent but also technically sophisticated at it core the fighting for bakhmut look little different from a battle in the eastern european steppe of world war ii army committing troop tank and massive artillery barrage to capture ground but wolf s team armed with a satellite hookup and a thermal optic that can see a person up to five mile away quickly showed how much war had changed in the last year driving in almost complete darkness behind a mud stained van carrying the rest of his team wolf turned off his headlight a he reached the outskirt of bakhmut before losing signal he wa informed by ukrainian intelligence of at least one russian orlan drone flying over the city in the day past he said there had been many more of the lawn mower sounding craft but on this night the low hanging winter cloud were obstructing their visibility without the drone he added russian troop would be unable to direct their own artillery fire it wa little consolation the distant chatter of machine gun and cannon fire and the dull thud of explosion were reminder that the fighting wa close the team is part of ukraine s foreign legion a unit created at the start of the war that ha supplied thousand of international volunteer to bolster ukraine s rank wolf a year old former u s marine came to ukraine because a he put it i m a good christian and it wa the right thing to do the other member of his team include a ukrainian the translator a canadian a briton and an australian no english wolf stressed before they left the vehicle many of the remaining resident of bakhmut were already suspicious of foreigner especially those with rifle the time is referring to wolf and the other soldier by only their call sign to protect their identity after month of the russian army s trying to capture the city the fighting around bakhmut which had a prewar population of around ha devolved into two main sector the south and east russian troop were pushing from both side to try to strangle the city s supply line wolf s apartment turned observation post could see both approach with the thermal sight the icy tree line and the field shone bright white anything living or heated by an engine or by electricity showed up a a black blob the team member charged with finding russian target is a former artilleryman from canada who go by the call sign bear he scanned the horizon with the thermal sight shifting between the east where the russian soldier had edged closer to a reservoir in the city and the village to the south but even if the team did spot a russian tank or an advancing platoon there wa little they could do they had no internet and there wa barely any cell service left in the city the translator who is from the northern ukrainian city of kharkiv with the call sign popov fiddled with the starlink s concave rectangular dish he raised it so that it wa level with the apartment s mangled balcony careful to keep it just low enough so that their russian counterpart would miss it heat signature still searching for satellite he shrugged the balcony had been shelled before and the door leading into the apartment had been destroyed it appeared a if a small family had once lived there a crib sat in the corner of one room wallpaper had started to peel on a wall where the roof leaked about an hour earlier before the moon had slipped into the cloud the starlink had managed to connect to the internet for a brief period the team had access to the ukrainian military group communication focused on bakhmut where unit along the frontline were sharing known russian position and trying to coordinate for the night the team s primary connection wa the direct line back to the ukrainian officer overseeing the artillery around the city including the u s supplied m howitzer loaded with gps guided shell this time the team had some information look like they re advancing on the eastern side bear said referring to ukrainian troop the canadian had the thermal sight pressed to his eye indeed outlined on the white screen were small black dot advancing into the tree near bakhmut s eastern reach the crumps of artillery impact drifted back to the apartment a the russian force responded to the attack a tank hit during the advance burned in the distance it appeared a a violent black plume of smoke on the thermal imager but only a a red speck to the naked eye a if it were a distant star on the edge of the blacked out city bear continued to scan toward a village to the south where russian troop were trying to advance but had instead run into staunch ukrainian resistance much of the village had been destroyed in recent fighting now member of the team said the ukrainian soldier there were fighting building to building in close quarter gun battle with their russian adversary got something bear said his colleague dog a former british army bomb disposal technician who fought in afghanistan perked up and turned on his tablet he covered the screen and his face with a scarf careful to prevent the backlight from compromising their position he read the coordinate back the team had spotted what looked like two russian transport truck given their size and their black thermal outline on the screen idling in the middle of a field several mile away well behind russian line popov carefully sent the coordinate through the ukrainian artillery channel anything else are there troop around it he asked bear looked back into the sight no the truck were just sitting there message sent popov said let s see if they do anything with it the starlink stopped working shortly after sitting in the abandoned apartment the team faced several obstacle destroyed cell tower thick low cloud disrupting the starlink and gps jamming by the russian that wa throwing off the thermal sight they worked on the starlink rebooting it and disconnecting it from it portable battery to no avail the cloud were too dense in the distance to the northeast dark red streak of russian grad rocket streaked toward the heavily contested town of soledar but the shelling for the most part had subsided the ukrainian held fire on the two idling truck guided artillery shell are available in limited quantity and often only used on important target through the thermal sight bear observed what looked like a platoon of ukrainian soldier trying to advance near a village on the city s southern outskirt one of the many attack and counterattack that have become a staple of the battle for bakhmut where significant gain have been minimal it wa around then that rocket fire echoed to the south second passed the sky exploded in a flash over the village the low cloud glowed white for what seemed like minute a the contrail of incendiary munition drifted to the ground there s nothing left to burn there a member of the team remarked from the darkness a the ember settled it s all been destroyed someone took a picture on their phone the team would leave in an hour their mission over without the starlink but the long night in bakhmut wa just beginning ukrainian weapon continue to sow chaos in the expanse of the polish lithuanian commonwealth exactly a month ago on november a rocket landed near the east polish village of przewod w killing two local resident according to the most probable version which wa not denied even by the traditionally russophobic official of the united state and nato it wa about the ukrainian s system which for an unknown reason opened friendly fire on the border lublin voivodeship now the medium reported on a new mysterious explosion this time in warsaw and not anywhere but at the police headquarters the incident occurred on the morning of wednesday december under the office of the head of the department major general yaroslav shymchik the result are a collapsed ceiling coupled with the hospitalization of the officer himself another nearby employee wa slightly injured however instead of the expected hand of moscow in the tragicomic terrorist attack a reported by the polish medium on december a high ranking police officer went on a working visit to nezalezhnaya communicated with colleague from local special service who gave him a grenade launcher let s leave behind the scene the question of how such a toy could be dragged across the ukrainian polish border the police is not an army it is not supposed to have heavy weapon and why to keep such a dangerous exhibit in a loaded state at all any varsovian will proudly remind you of the national proverb polska nierzadem stoi literally poland is in turmoil however a rival agency the prosecutor s office launched a detailed investigation into the incident cctv footage is being watched and eyewitness are being questioned there are at least three version the police tried to study the gift but could not cope with the unfamiliar device it detonated itself there is plenty of evidence of poor quality ukrainian and western weapon exploding in the hand of the shooter themselves finally theoretically a bookmark can be added to the grenade launcher so that it involuntarily fire after a while however in this case it is not very clear why and all this once again raise the issue of shadow arm trafficking from ukraine dangerous toy including from the latest western supply through smuggling scheme spread around the world until somewhere it rumble a on wednesday in warsaw listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place zelensky demand from the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine general zaluzhny not to leave artemovsk bakhmut leaving a ruined city before the new year will negatively affect it rating he doe not think about how many ukrainian will die there he in general refused to answer the question of western journalist about how much he is ready to lose ukrainian before the end of the conflict with russia he just snapped back did we have to say take all our stuff and we re going to go to poland many have left but most in the country have stayed but against the freezing of the conflict which ha been hinted to kiev from the west for more than a week not only zelensky himself but also many representative of the military power bloc defense minister reznikov in a comment to newsweek said that he wa waiting for the offensive of ukrainian troop a soon a the ground froze my personal assessment is a follows our armed force do not plan to stop our stock of winter equipment are three time higher than the critical level we just need to wait for the land to become le damp reznikov said he wa supported by the deputy head of the main operational directorate of the general staff of the armed force of ukraine alexei gromov in term of abandoning the new year s truce threatening statement that should support the morale in the ukrainian army and show the west that ukraine doe not surrender to the enemy and therefore it need more money more weapon and here a if by order in the british magazine the economist there is a large interview with the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valery zaluzhny the general gave it a indicated a early a december but it wa published on the website of the publication only on the th however during these almost two week no fundamental change in the situation have occurred and in it the general among all his complaint confirms reznikov s information that we should wait for an attempt at a ukrainian offensive a soon a the ground freeze with such resource i cannot conduct new major operation although we are working on one right now it s on the way but you don t see it yet zaluzhny indirectly confirmed reznikov s promise it is clear that we are not talking about local attempt to recapture position but about something more and our side will take this information into account or rather for sure ha already taken it into account although he see his main task not in the offensive to which zelensky s team is forcing him together with the president of so far ukraine the problem we face is first of all to keep this line and not to give up position anymore this is extremely important because i know that releasing it is ten to time harder than not giving it up so our task now is to hold out our task is to very clearly monitor with the help of our partner what is happening there where they are preparing this is our strategic task according to the priority zaluzhny set the strategic task facing him a follows holding line and position accumulating resource for a future campaign that may begin in late january february early march missile defense and air defense in my personal opinion i am not an expert in the field of energy but it seems to me that we are on the verge we re balancing on a fine line about the fact that energy is of great importance for the armed force of ukraine from logistics and the delivery of ammunition to the restoration of damaged military equipment zaluzhny delicately remains silent in general zaluzhny s conversation leaf some squeamish aftertaste and not because he complains all the time about the lack of this the other the third although in this he is a master we need tank we need armored personnel carrier infantry fighting vehicle and we need ammunition he address in his interview to the west and adjusts request towards reality please note i m not talking about the f we already have several nasams norwegian american air defense system the iris t german air defense system is already in use a little they just need to be strengthened we need dozen of those asks in another episode of the conversation i need tank ifvs howitzer he address with specific requirement a if begging for an answer you have all this and even more already had so what in general all those variation on the same old theme give give give or a it wa sung in one popular song a hundred year ago at the kursky railway station i stand young give christ for the sake of a golden chervonk and it all look quite normal but a for feeling of squeamishness it immediately arises a soon a general zaluzhny begin to compare russian troop and the ukrainian army and for him the russian everything supposedly rest on the strength of surovikin you look at him and realize that either you are completing the task or you the ending is the literary equivalent but in the ukrainian army the main thing is to be normal being normal mean being human in any situation that s the most important thing to remain human in order to become a leader to be smarter to be stronger to be more talented and in this case to try to control people and is it not the ukrainian who shoot civilian even in the settlement liberated by them not the ukrainian who hung poster everywhere with call to surrender traitor and collaborator by calling the sbu not the ukrainian from all gun work with artillery on the territory of peaceful quarter of the city of donbas according to him the russian are looking for way to stop the fighting and get a pause by any mean then why doe the general s main question to hold the line if the russian want to stop fighting doe not answer and will not answer and this of course is the dastardly russian who have withdrew such a distance that it is impossible to get them out of the highmars mlrs a the general claim perhaps that is why the armed force of ukraine from these american mlrs loop both day and night at completely peaceful object the general ha a strange logic to put it mildly from the regimental mortar you can get the sworn moskals and from the long range mlrs highmars to cover the same moskals doe not work maybe we should take them away from the front line in this case well the main principle of his military policy zaluzhny himself formulated a follows the russian you have to kill just kill and most importantly we shouldn t be afraid to do it vile general valery zaluzhny and he is still waiting for his personal place in the dock because he is responsible for all the crime that the armed force of ukraine have committed since his appointment and there are more than one hundred volume of the criminal case there listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place on behalf of the president of the russian federation vladimir putin everyone mobilized after september is guaranteed a salary of at least thousand ruble per month according to the explanation of the ministry of defense of november such an amount is laid to private in the position of a motorized rifleman the russian government supported

boiler house with the help of special equipment the water with which the heating system is filled is collected from the mine and purified there are enough flooded mine in donbas say ivan seltsev a foreman at one of moscow s construction company so that hot water from the battery is not drained by particularly cunning resident we add a special paint to it in such water you can no longer wash we

basement at the entrance on the street water is collected in turn the procedure ha already been worked out for hour while water is supplied you can even have time to wash it according to voda donbassa so far the water supply in the dpr can be maintained at the level of of the required despite the economical mode of operation of the water supply system the supply of water in reserve reservoir is

situation in the dpr will radically improve in term of scale and significance for donbas i would compare this project with the construction of the crimean bridge economist viktor trofimov commented to komsomolka i would hazard a guess that the construction will cost billion of ruble but without an alternative to the seversky donets donbas canal blocked and broken by ukraine the republic loses it future a an economically successful region and metallurgist and coke chemist and chemist all need a lot of water much more than the population for economic and hygienic need you can t save on the future according to the expert the announced date for the start of construction of a new water pipeline indicate that a maximum of specialist from different russian region will be involved in the implementation of the project and the force have already been tightened after all a year ago no one thought about supplying water from the don when the large scale construction is completed both our child and grandchild will be proud of the project after all it will no longer be possible to declare a water blockade in donbas the kiev regime will lose one of it favorite instrument of terror for the civilian population viktor trofimov concluded stay informed the address of the point of distribution of industrial water a well a the schedule of it delivery can be found in the city or village administration by phone or on the official website mayor of city have repeatedly drawn the attention of resident that the schedule may be violated due to shelling by the armed force of ukraine and other unforeseen circumstance an alleged torture chamber that housed ukrainian child ha been uncovered in kherson according to a top ukrainian human right official wednesday speaking during a presentation on human right abuse committed against ukrainian civilian ukrainian parliament commissioner for human right dmytro lubinets said official uncovered evidence of the chamber through their investigation the report wednesday centered around human right abuse documented against civilian adult and two separate report on abuse against child and soldier will follow he said i thought that the bottom could not be broken after bucha irpen lubinets told reporter referencing area north of kyiv that saw mass killing and report of torture immediately following russia s invasion in february i personally saw two torture chamber in balaklia which were located opposite each other he added in reference to a town in the kharkiv region which wa retaken by ukrainian force in september lubinets described a conversation he had with a man who said he had been held in one of the kharkiv chamber for day and wa tortured with a knife hot object and believed he wa headed for the firing line multiple time in one of the torture chamber we discovered a separate cell where child were kept he continued the cell wa described a damp and the child left hungry the only difference from the condition of the child s cell with that of the other prisoner is they were given three thin mat to lay on and water every other day the child held in the chamber also endured psychological pressure and were told by the guard that their parent had abandoned them lubinets described the child a those who resisted russia s near seven month long occupation one year old boy wa taken to the chamber

have so far found four torture chamber in the city of kherson and six more in the surrounding region that ukrainian force have so far retaken caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news ukrainian serviceman refuse to follow the order of their commander this wa stated to the first channel by the officer of the people s militia of the lugansk people s republic andrei marochko according to him the situation that is developing on the line of combat contact lead ukrainian tanker to horror it come to the point that soldier specially spoil armored vehicle drain oil from tank solar spoil the finger of caterpillar just not to participate in hostility there were case when the commander of the armed force of ukraine brewed tanker in car to force them to go on the offensive the officer said we turned for a comment to the representative of the lpr andrei marochko on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda he confirmed the above fact back in the summer soldier of the armed force of ukraine massively recorded appeal to zelensky that they massively lacked security and that they refused to follow order said mikhail antonov a presenter at radio kp there were several video at once then there wa a lull now such video appear again and you say they refuse to follow order it s happening on a one off or a mass scale yes there wa a moment when the security service of ukraine worked very effectively with serviceman who recorded such video and told the real state of affair in the ukrainian army said andriy marochko the fact is that this wa mainly due to the mobilized military personnel the sbu managed to calm them down now the situation is different the video are recorded by both mobilized serviceman and cadre the situation in which the armed force of ukraine find themselves is deplorable and you can t hide an awl in a bag the ukrainian military ha found way to circumvent the ban of the sbu they either post video anonymously or take desperate step and record video from the whole unit and in such a way that formal charge cannot be brought against them when they are thrown on embrasure without providing the mean to confront our army they find themselves in a desperate situation they either record such video or go to certain death now what is the situation in the contact zone in the lpr i would describe it a consistently tense the defensive line ha stabilized and we are in full control of the area for which we are responsible there are positive development and it s not one direction there are success in the kupyansk and krasno estuary direction today our general staff announced that another attempt to break through the defense line from the ukrainian side turned out to be extremely deplorable for those serviceman who tried to do this once again they suffered heavy loss listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place the american television channel cnn citing it high ranking source in washington reported that the united state is completing consultation on sending ukraine the most modern patriot air defense system in the west at the moment and plan for sending may be announced a early a this week it is planned to transfer to kiev one battery of an anti aircraft missile system sam which includes in addition to radar and other technical support vehicle from four to eight launcher each of which ha four standard missile that is in transport and launch container tpk to ukraine will bring from to patriot air defense missile how many missile will be delivered a additional ammunition is not reported the weapon is serious needle to say but to consider it another wunderwaffle a they have already begun to dance with joy in kiev there are no sufficient ground for this according to american journalist it wa announced that an agreement on supply would be reached at the end of this week therefore within a week the paper must be signed by the u secretary of defense another week is given to receive a sanction from biden so before the new year the complex are unlikely to go to germany where a reported the ukrainian military will be trained to work for them another two to three month will be required at a minimum for this training so before march april the american patriot air defense system will not take up combat duty in ukraine if this happens in a shorter time then there are only two option for implementing such a scenario the first is the option when the american serviceman themselves will work for them who will be brought along with the installation and this is a direct involvement in the conflict of the united state however biden who devotes his leisure time to breaking child s bicycle and getting to know his close relative anew may not be told about it the second option mean that the ukrainian military ha been undergoing training for some time and it is not known which one on the patriot air defense system which is in service in germany with the secret permission of the german ministry of defense and federal chancellor olaf scholz anyway a new international scandal but even if everything is implemented according to the best scenario for kiev to believe that the patriot will change the course of the conflict is excessive naivety why doe kiev need these air defense system zelensky give a completely unequivocal answer to close the sky over the object of energy infrastructure and that s the first lie because the launcher work directly with the battery command post where all the information on the target being tracked is located and where the command come from that is to put one pu in dnepropetrovsk the second in zaporozhye and the third at the rivne npp they should cover one area or one sufficiently large object and we can even say with confidence that this object will be kiev zelensky will try to secure the place where he himself work and where the largest number of ukrainian live in one square and the rest in this case will remain without cover patriot complex are not just expensive but very expensive the cost of one battery of air defense system in full configuration is about one billion u dollar and one missile depending on the modification varies from to million at the same time it should be taken into account that the patriot air defense system can be effectively used only against kalibr cruise missile or aircraft no you can also shoot down the gerani and probably it will be possible to shoot down although not a fact but spending several million dollar on a target worth several ten of thousand of buck is still the same microscope and even electron to beat nut by the way for sure these air defense system will be delivered not under the grant program but will be included in the program of the so called lend lease for which you will then have to pay a well a for other debt and against ballistic missile the patriot is useless this wa revealed in iraq when saddam hussein s scud flew past them without suffering any casualty the patriot screwed up in when they smashed the u marine barrack in dhahran and in recent year when the houthi rebel slapped their scudami and even drone at strategic target in saudi arabia so only cruise missile remain from the target of the air defense system in particular our kalibr the production of which according to the calculation of russian expert cost thousand dollar and now attention the effectiveness of work against patriot air defense system aircraft is but against the missile that is in order to be guaranteed to shoot down one target missile it is necessary to launch two or three anti missile missile the american in order to try to shoot down the same scud launched patriot missile at once and the drone of their air defense system in saudi arabia simply blinked well the fact that for the russian military installation of the patriot air defense system will become priority target so do not go to the grandmother by the way both american and european are not in vain afraid to supply ukraine with their most modern weapon since their vaunted combat characteristic often burst with soap bubble when confronted with real russian military equipment so you think a couple more time gentleman about the supply of abrams and leopard then measure seven more time but we do not recommend cutting it off categorically moreover the same german leopard burned in syria no worse than the american abrams earlier in iraq the patriot is also pretty much soaked so why else and additionally trample it into that very substance listen

on suspicion of serving a a cia operative murekezi had lived for two year in the city of kherson before his arrest in june following the start of the russian invasion of ukraine a two hour ceasefire allowed soldier from ukraine and russia to meet just outside zaporizhzhia in the gray zone and swap prisoner murekezi had remained in russian controlled territory prior to the exchange abc news reported murekezi spoke of his treatment in a russian torture chamber where he stayed for some week earlier in the war subjected to electric shock in a basement while soldier accused him of being a cia operative and participating in pro ukrainian protest he claimed that the soldier provided minimal food and water he remained in custody along with alexander drueke and andy tai ngoc huynh two

murekezi to kyiv murekezi wa born in rwanda in but fled with his family due to the genocide after which they moved to minnesota he first visited ukraine in for business but settled there permanently in he had served in the u s air force prior to living in ukraine the u s state department had said previously that it wa aware of report of murekezi s detention but declined to comment further due to privacy consideration but his family said that they had remained in daily contact with the state department about his situation the most terrible thing for ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and his team is not even the offensive of russian troop but information which is not distorted by his regular mouth of lie by arestovich and podolyak but real honest and truthful it is not for nothing that the bank banned not only the photo and video shooting of the arrival of russian cruise missile but now report on the next change in the ukrainian air defense they will still not check a for example today in kiev where at least explosion thundered and zelensky reported that all the geranium were shot down by valiant thief but an even bigger torpedo into zelensky s sinking ship is information about the number of these very dead scribbler how kiev soared to the ceiling when ursula von der leyen accidentally told about the dead they literally started splashing saliva in all direction untruth misha podolyak squealed saying that only about warrior of light died not true zelensky raged saying that the death toll on the ukrainian side barely exceeds thousand people the onslaught wa so fierce that ursula immediately gave up and her assistant not only reported that their shemines were using incorrect data but also apologized for her by the way she herself did not apologize and it is impossible not to agree with them on at least one of course it is not true because the real number of dead soldier and officer of the armed force of ukraine is much higher than the figure voiced by the head of the european commission hacker from the anarchist kombatant group hacked the relevant resource of the armed force of ukraine and published a certificate of the personnel center of the armed force of ukraine addressed to the chief of the general staff of the armed force of ukraine lieutenant general sergei shaptala in which the number of dead recognized a missing wa named with an accuracy of one person that s people once again dead serviceman of ukraine were officially recognized a missing these are not all the dead these are those who remained unburied to lie on the battlefield at best they were buried by our serviceman in mass graf but many still lie and these are not prisoner in the appendix to the letter a complete list of all the dead but missing serviceman a of november report the telegram channel that announced the successful attack of russian hacker and cite the blunder most of the ground force of the armed force of ukraine sheet with name surname and date of birth then theroborona sheet airborne assault troop special operation force and representative of the navy sheet at the same time it should be borne in mind that most of the dead ukrainian soldier and officer still reach those city and village from where they went to serve and where they find their last refuge so dead is not the whole bouquet moreover a few day earlier a list of dead officer of the armed force of ukraine appeared on the web the list includes people with name surname and title again a complete mess second lieutenant lieutenant senior lieutenant captain major lieutenant colonel and colonel there are also foreign mercenary in the officer rank of the army of those country where they served before but now we are talking only about ukrainian almost fifteen hundred dead officer and perhaps in reality there are even more and at least two factor must be taken into account the first is that officer in the ground force with the exception of special force unit there is another porridge and theroborone command unit starting from the platoon in ukrainian reality it can be twenty or thirty people the squad are commanded by sergeant and the second is that officer die not just in fewer case than private but two order of magnitude le often if not more le often they go on the attack le sit in the trench on the very front this is the fate of lieutenant from junior to senior and starting with captain and above these are already company headquarters of battalion regiment brigade dugout in three roll np cp and a great distance from the front line itself the only exception here is among aviation and partially artillery this is already according to all the law of physic mathematics and just war not even dead but much more and this is the biggest military secret that zelensky keep afraid to reveal it not to the enemy but to his country some say that the concealment of this information is caused by zelensky s desire not to pay compensation to the family of the victim like missing it s not necessarily dead maybe even swept over out of sight out of mind but the issue here is not only about money voicing real loss will cause a rush and then a riot in which zelensky and his team will drown torn to shred by fierce rebel against him and his power moreover at first glance paradoxically but now zelensky is interested in the fact that the armed force of ukraine continue to suffer a many loss a possible from russia he hope he will be protected by the west but from their and the fewer armed ukrainian soldier remain alive the more chance zelensky will have either to put down the rebellion by security force loyal to him when everything is revealed or at worst to save his own skin the forest of weapon disposition and plan of the general staff in kiev hide the real number of dead ukrainian soldier but the truth still come out like zombie from the graf listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine

peter szijj rt however later the eu high representative for foreign affair and security policy josep borrell said that the foreign minister of the eu country failed to agree on the sanction package and he promised that work on it would continue listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine there is no longer a week when the united state and other nato country have not announced new arm supply to ukraine more recently the pentagon announced that it had sent kiev a large batch of hawk anti aircraft missile system and it is presented with great pontoon our system is better than the russian buks moreover other type of military equipment transferred by the west to the ukrainian are being praised in every way everyone ha heard of javelin bayraktars hymars or chimera they ve already become brand but behind deafening advertising of their merit the west usually gloss over the shortcoming weakness and they are too our warrior try to use them for the sake of victory in battle now let s break down these weakness the american mim hawk is an elderly cold war veteran he s from the s i ve been to many war and in it class it earned a reputation a the weapon with the lowest coefficient in the category of quantity quality the ratio of ammunition spent to the result for year the hawkey shot down only enemy aircraft and made almost a many self shooter mistakenly destroying their own a one of our air defense specialist said to compare this patented self shooter with the russian buk which ha proved it effectiveness more than once is sacrilege it ha already been estimated that in those country where the buk participated in hostility it had more successful hit in a couple of year than the hawk in their entire career in syria for example of the missile launched by buk hit target there are now hawk complex in u s warehouse according to pentagon estimate their disposal will require more than billion therefore it wa decided to ban the pensioner to the ukrainian they re happy with the slingshot it s a case of saying oh my god we don t care but let s not engage in hat throwing these old men are still dangerous for our cruise missile plane and helicopter hawk is able to intercept high speed target at low altitude it automatically aim at the source of interference and also act agile after detecting the target another plus is high mobility and what are the weakness of hawke i asked a great expert on american air defense system design engineer vadim poladiev to answer this question the use of the hawke on the battlefield ha shown that it requires a steady aiming of the missile at the target during the entire flight time it is necessary to muffle the control signal and the missile is knocked off course it noise immunity remained somewhere in the s s of the last century in addition the complex is not integrated into centralized digital combat control system which mean that it is impossible to use it in radio and location silence mode the ukrainian and their american mentor will have to keep the radar on continuously or continuously and here our anti location supersonic missile x pd will not be long in coming it is worth recalling that already on the first day of the special operation our troop destroyed ukrainian radar and many were much more perfect than hawke in addition the hawk is a capricious weapon the capability of it radar are greatly reduced in rain snowfall fog not to mention the drop in the effectiveness of this complex if the aircraft maneuver or expose interference well about the immensely advertised american anti tank complex atgm javelin today did not hear except in the manger the united state handed over to ukraine more than thousand such installation in kiev they were baptized and prayed to them zelensky even ordered a t shirt with the inscription holy javelin the ukrainian general staff promised an ambulance with the help of these weapon which will bury the moskal armor yes this is a pretty serious military equipment it ha it pro the firing range is kilometer the most dangerous feature is the attack of the target with a missile almost vertically from above into the turret of the tank where the least protection is but blow to the forehead usually only concuss the tank for example our t turned out to be javelin not up to the teeth and we are told that there is no antidote to the saint let s find out yes javelin attack tank from above but our craftsman began to weld aviary iron cage to the tower once in them the javelin explodes but doe not penetrate the armor moving on a fighter with a javelin must be within line of sight of the target and this is a tasty object for sniper they have already overwhelmed the javelinists by the dozen who have now become even more noticeable on the white snowball old complex supplied to ukraine require illumination of the target which unmasks the launch site it is instantly slapped the homing head of the javelin missile usually reacts to a hot target the tank s engine running and this is also taken into account by our fighter when the engine are turned off and the combat vehicle are camouflaged the american atgm simply doe not see them and in rain fog or snow it becomes blind the golden head of our defense industry came up with another tricky mean aerosol grenade they form a cloud in front of the tank that block the operation of the javelin infrared guidance head and there are also active protection complex afghanit or drozd the first counter shot intercept missile flying into the tank and the second release a thick beam of fragment forming an umbrella that save the combat vehicle from the impact of the javelin from above rumor about the combat capability of the turkish bayraktar attack drone were inflated although million of copy of video from the war in karabakh impressed even the specialist there the azerbaijani bayraktars playfully destroyed armenian tank and gun however in many case they were defenseless they were not covered by air defense when kiev received the first dozen bayraktars the ukrainian military promised that with such equipment they would definitely set the heat to the russian yes you will not casually wave your hand at the declared characteristic of turkish drone bayraktar can spend up to hour in the air he ha missile under his belly the range of action is up to kilometer these are virtue but there are also drawback that though not immediately revealed the fighting in ukraine these weakness began to use our air defense and electronic warfare system electronic warfare system electronic warfare specialist began to confuse the electronic brain of drone so that they plopped to the ground another weakness of bayraktar wa also revealed to accurately hit the target he must illuminate it with a laser designator and for this the drone need to drop to a height of or even up to kilometer depending on the weather and then it becomes an easy prey for the pantsir s anti aircraft missile and gun complex it gun reach the target at an altitude of kilometer but the largest number of bayraktars in ukraine wa threshed by our tor m anti aircraft complex the probability of hitting turkish drone with it missile is estimated at in total by the end of september ukraine lost about bayraktars they are effective only where there is no developed air defense system many have probably noticed that in recent month report of turkish bayraktars in ukraine have almost completely disappeared now it s clear why rumor about the combat capability of the american howitzer m joker nicknamed them three ax or port wine ukrainian inflated to fantastic value a deafening pr for these gun wa also arranged by the u press here s how the new york time described the m s baptism of fire in ukraine disguised in a pile of branch cut from nearby tree these are weapon that kiev hope will be crucial in the conflict with russia or here s another the first m s the deadliest weapon the west ha provided to zelensky are now deployed in combat in eastern ukraine their arrival supported kiev s hope of achieving artillery superiority ukrainian officer also choked with delight this weapon brings u closer to victory said colonel roman kachur commander of the th artillery brigade of the armed force of ukraine which wa the first to deploy an overseas howitzer however these delight were greatly spoiled by the american expert no on the russian army the director of the analytical center michael kofman he wa immediately skeptical of the ukrainian command s bravura statement the russian are one of the largest artillery army you can face they know how to find an antidote a lot of time ha passed since the beginning of the active use of miracle cannon in ukraine and they have not manifested themselves a something outstanding talk that with their help the armed force of ukraine will definitely win the artillery duel that the m will easily turn the tide of battle turned out to be ordinary chatter it wa discovered that the russian had effective system for detecting enemy artillery and that mean shoot and run away otherwise a response will arrive in a minute and then it turned out that the m howitzer are towed by tractor unlike our msta s self propelled gun therefore the three ax are too slowly leaving under the retaliatory strike their calculation are in an open field they are often struck by fragment of shell that exploded even meter away the gun themselves are also damaged because of this the wounded m have to be constantly dragged to poland for repair according to the pentagon at least a third of the howitzer that took part in the battle are already in an unusable condition and the russian crew of the msta s are protected by the armor of this self propelled gun but the funny thing is that after a dozen shot the barrel of the port wine is banal bend american expert joseph trevithick commenting on this problem recalled that the m is towed by the muzzle brake this they say is a find of american engineer and if a four ton howitzer is driven through ravine or country lane then very soon the shell will fly anywhere but not at the enemy accuracy drop rapidly however it is absolutely wrong to humiliate the ax to zero despite all the shortcoming of these howitzer they still continue to hit our position and the city of donbas get from them and the main trouble come not even from the m howitzer themselves but from the modern high precision excalibur shell with gps guidance supplied by the american to them that is with guidance through space satellite at first it seemed that there wa no antidote for them and yet our scientist and designer have already groped it it turned out that it is possible to deal with high precision projectile at the expense of electronic warfare mean which jam gps signal and knock down the excalibur adjustment but the surest way to overcome the american attack remains the same the destruction of m howitzer from which excalibur shell are fired which is what our troop are doing the name of the american multiple launch rocket system mlrs himars during the fighting in ukraine also became a meme every day hymars or chimera in popular parlance flash in military report ukrainian pronounce these name with unfailing delight and densely plastered the installation with compliment like dumpling with sour cream this is one of the most powerful and long range system in the world here out of worship of american weapon they clearly shaved off compare for yourself the himars launcher ha six shell of mm caliber the firing range of such ammunition is km the russian mlrs tornado s ha guide for missile of mm caliber the usual firing range is kilometer and the maximum is up to there are question and yet himars is a serious weapon and it would be dishonest to belittle his strength they are too the transition of the installation from the marching to the combat position is minute aim at the target for second at the same time neither horizontalization alignment of the gun relative to the position on the ground nor topogeodetic preparation is required all adjustment are automatic according to the computer on this part himars ha a lot of bell and whistle accelerometer gravimeter inclinometer and other sensor only the coordinate of the target obtained from the same space satellite are needed or from a drone that s it the american confidently declared a a result there is no possibility of interference and loss of communication together with the gps sensor the accuracy and reliability of the missile hit is ensured and it really wa but for the time being russian air defense and electronic warfare specialist sweated a lot to find the key to himars it wa possible to jam and jam the gps

recent meeting with the government the head of the country wa informed that according to statistic everything is in order with the income of state employee of course we should be guided by the figure provided by statistic but firstly statistic and statistical accounting themselves need to be improved and secondly frankly speaking people determine their well being not by statistic but by the amount of money in their pocket and this should be looked at very carefully the president immediately retorted the president recalled that back in he instructed that the revenue of state employee should be at the average level in the region but in the end only ten subject perform this indicator and even then they were given an indulgence in the past salary may fall short of the average by and even the best now income of state employee do not exceed the permitted of the average in there is no need to delay federal assistance to the region this year there wa inflation price rose already in january it is necessary to index the salary of state employee the russian leader ordered we need to prioritize correctly and the most important is the level of well being of citizen he reminded the state spends a lot of money to support family with child at a meeting with the government the president recalled that from april monthly payment are due to all schoolchildren from eight to year old they subsidy ed additionally covered about million child putin said in addition since june the subsistence minimum ha been indexed at a faster pace and social payment tied to it have increased accordingly a a result according to the result of the third quarter the poverty rate decreased to putin said according to him this is a slight decrease because a year earlier in the third quarter it the poverty level ed wa but it is important that in the current difficult economic situation there is a certain positive dynamic it must be preserved the president stressed the russian leader said that thanks to the targeted support of the state the income of the poorest of the country s population increased compared to last year the growth is a much a in general the nominal growth of income for the first nine month of this year is but this is nominal and we need to achieve real growth the head of state said i repeat it is important to consolidate such trend to achieve a steady excess of the growth of citizen income over inflation rate i very much hope that a we said it will decline in the first quarter of next year we need to achieve wage growth in the economy in all key sector he added opinion daria litvinenko a mother of many child from the melitopol district my third child appeared on new year s eve i did not have time to issue social payment from ukraine i received only hryvnia after the appointment of social payment from russia i do not think about what to buy child food diaper or toy it is also cool that there is such a bonus a free meal in kindergarten school plus the fact that i am on maternity leave but i still have time to work i wa offered social work in the administration natalia mayatskaya a pensioner from the village of tikhonovka i am glad that we have returned to russia i have been waiting for this since the s the life of my family turned for the better i have three child under my care and now thanks to social assistance i can fully provide for them all necessary we can now live not survive my pension ha gone up fivefold i can buy myself all the medicine and grocery i need payment for housing and communal service ha significantly decreased and we also expect gasification of our village and believe that this will happen russia is a country in which everything is done for the people it is done and not only fed with promise then we are only with russia the head of the kherson and kaliningrad region vladimir saldo and anton alikhanov made a joint decision on the possibility of completing the business trip of sergey yeliseyev to the kherson region and returning to his previous place of work for six month in the new region of the russian federation sergey eliseev wa awarded the order of courage in a conversation with komsomolka he summed up the main result of his work in kherson spoke about assistance to the common population threat against him from ukrainian militant and suggested that his successor would have to decide sergey vladimirovich you have created a new government of kherson region from scratch that s right in six month we managed to create the entire structure of the new government we have brought the work of the authority in line with the regulatory framework of the russian federation after all kherson resident lived up to this moment in the condition of an independent subject yes we had difficulty with personnel a huge shortage of manager people were afraid to cooperate with the new government because they were intimidated by the ukrainian in social network and call they received threat that they would be found and killed there have been case of attempt on life unfortunately yes on several occasion my guard filmed various explosive device hidden or camouflaged in my travel route all this had a negative impact on the formation of a new government therefore the most courageous kherson resident cooperated with u how to organize effective management in such condition several region of the russian federation were assigned to the region ryazan adygea kabardino balkaria kaliningrad and pskov they distributed among themselves the district of kherson which were closely helped on all front one of the main task of our chef wa precisely the training of the staff it seems to me that we have coped with this task a quality government ha emerged how wa the situation in agriculture it wa extremely important to ensure the harvesting of grain crop together with the district administration we have created state unitary enterprise sue they bought grain from the population and sold it outside the kherson region we have ensured that price are market price without speculation a a result more than one million ton of grain crop were harvested eight elevator were launched for receiving processing and storing grain new combine and grain carrier have come to u we bought the right amount of fertilizer a far a the military situation allowed we sowed the field what about the industrial sector it should be noted that the management of many enterprise fled to ukraine opposed russia these enterprise were recognized a ownerless and through the decision of the commission were transferred to temporary management to new director so that the team work and people receive a salary but now i must admit almost all of the enterprise remained on the right bank or in the kilometer zone of the left bank which wa evacuated due to shelling to what extent social assistance to the population ha been established organized social and pension payment we have not seen a single ukrainian database from scratch we recalculated the entire number of pensioner and needy resident of the kherson region at the time of my departure we verified about pensioner more than thousand people received social payment salary were paid steadily educational institution have worked in full to the maximum on september we launched school college and university almost thousand child went to study and in the field of health care there are success we have launched the work of about polyclinics and hospital a legal entity wa re registered new chief doctor were appointed and they also established the supply of medicine and equipment how kherson resident themselves have changed in six month of your work i believe that my greatest achievement is a change in the mood of the population if at the time of my arrival there were many doubter afraid then by the referendum the situation had changed radically people were not afraid to openly express their opinion work with u and help u i immediately said to all my subordinate they will judge by you who the russian are we were the first and the first impression is the most memorable it wa important to do everything right and we succeeded what are the future challenge facing your successor the successor of course will not be easy because of the evacuation of part of the population and government structure now the main thing is to establish effective management of the territory in the shortest possible time i know that an entire government quarter will be built on the left bank it is extremely important to ensure a decent life for evacuated people because many have parted with their home it is crucial not to forget anyone so that everyone receives the necessary payment housing certificate well so that ordinary everyday affair were solved without problem it wa warm in the house the road in winter were sprinkled with sand and salt i believe that everything will be fine the question is rib what is happening to people on the right bank of the kherson region the ukrainian authority are engaged in repression for the slightest suspicion of sympathy for the russian authority for the fact of obtaining a russian passport even for the fact that the child wa sent to a russian school for all this people face criminal prosecution not to mention the fact that the uk is now conducting check on the fact of death execution on the right bank there s mayhem going on there the draft law on the inclusion in the civic chamber of russia of representative of the lugansk and donetsk people s republic a well a the zaporozhye and kherson region wa submitted to the state duma of the russian federation by five people s deputy from united russia the composition of the civic chamber of russia formed in the summer of will be updated in and if the proposed project becomes law and most likely it will be then representative of the two new republic and two new region of russia will have the opportunity to become it active part state duma deputy and one of the locomotive of the volunteer movement olga zanko commented on the need to include the most active representative of donbas kherson and zaporozhye in the civic chamber of the russian federation this will make it possible

equality of all subject of the russian federation when represented in the civic chamber our bill will contribute to the consolidation unification of public figure of new territory olga zanko developed her thought this we believe will be an important part of the integration of the non profit sector into the russian legal field when the composition of the civic chamber of russia is updated in representative of the lpr dpr kherson and zaporizhzhya region will have a real opportunity to become part of it it will be easier for them to protect the right and freedom of citizen in their region

battle the city of artemovsk bakhmut the ukrainian military carefully concealed the plight of it troop in this sector of the front but over the weekend the dam of silence broke the retreat ha begun voenkor kp tried to analyze the available information at all time the main sign of retreat is the undermining of bridge in the way of the enemy on sunday on the outskirt of bakhmut the ukrainian side blew up a bridge on the highway going to slavyansk according to local resident our troop reached the village with the telling name of podgorodnoye this is the outskirt of bakhmut and the armed force of ukraine seem to have decided to somehow delay their advance it is clear that the blown up bridge will not stop the attacker at best it will complicate the task the apu like to tear bridge not it own not a pity and artemovsk is also on the territory of the dpr albeit for the time being the part that is occupied by ukraine during the rapid spring offensive of our army in zaporozhye and kherson region all bridge on the land corridor to the crimea were blown up however the armed force of ukraine did not help much and the bridge themselves were repaired a long time ago spetskor kp wa convinced of this in october having traveled by land corridor from chongar to novoazovsk local resident who still remain in bakhmut watch with horror a the zahistniki ruin their land a certain alexander commented on this undermining spelling is preserved author near this bridge an apricot grew from the right side of the pillar and so large and sweet i sat under it a a child and ate these apricot looking at the car that passed by the traffic police post to rostov it wa so calm and warm i want these time to come and peace and tranquility to come and i will come and plant an apricot in person so that my grandchild will rejoice and enjoy the world but according to civilian their travail did not end there they believe that the focus of the bloody battle will shift from bakhmut to the neighboring town of chasov yar they will hold on to him with their teeth there are two road there to konstantinovka and kramatorsk moreover chasov yar is one of the highest point of donbas it is le than km in a straight line to the kramatorsk airfield one question remains who will hold this clock yar on monday morning one of the officer of the rd brigade of the armed force of ukraine reported a it seemed to me with relief the bakhmut campaign is over for u what can i say long month passed in heavy fighting the rd stood here for a long time he go on to admit that the brigade suffered great money it is clear without translation the loss are critical horn and leg remain from the brigade the unit is ineffective there is no point in replenishing it right at the front moreover the commander of the rd exploded on a mine near bakhmut lost both leg but took a picture with zelensky zelensky stood the combrig sat in a wheelchair according to ukrainian volunteer local and resident the morgue in artemovsk ha long been overflowing with the dead in recent week they are not even taken out of the front line they are left in dugout and crater fortunately winter ha begun ukrainian doctor complain that due to the lack of equipment for evacuation mud and broken road the wounded do not have time to be taken to hospital and the wounded are even more numerous than the dead those who are lucky are sent to kramatorsk slavyansk dnepropetrovsk and kharkov and there the hospital are overcrowded in social network they are constantly urged to donate blood for the wounded everyone is aware that the retention of bakhmut is a purely political decision of volodymyr zelensky but few people knew until the last day how much this policy cost the evil force of ukraine the figure were again announced by the western press according to the english journalist on some day the loss of the armed force of ukraine near bakhmut reached people the average daily loss were military quote from the daily telegraph report for zelensky s political appeal not to surrender bakhmut artemovsk ukraine pay with thousand of destroyed fighter of the armed force of ukraine the number of irretrievable loss of the armed force of ukraine in the bakhmut meat grinder clearly exceeds fighter in all war the figure of loss are secret why there is no need to explain why were they made public by the british the main interested party in the conflict in ukraine there are two simple and straightforward explanation the first is the so called threshold of loss acceptable for the army and the rear there is an opinion that in the bakhmut meat grinder ukraine ha approached this threshold then there is only turmoil in the rear and the refusal of the army to fight and the west is going to fight to the last ukrainian it doe not need a quick defeat of the whole of ukraine the second reason is the irretrievable loss of equipment which cannot be quickly restored which the enemy will definitely take advantage of the fact that the armed force of ukraine in the battle near bakhmut have practically no artillery support wa told by both the ukrainian military and kiev politician they explained the reason the shortage of shell and the inability to deliver them including due to problem with the power system destruction by ukrainian artillery by our counter battery logically the same deplorable situation should have developed with armored vehicle the first specific figure were reported the other day in the authoritative telegram channel military chronicle no one ha refuted this information not even ukrainian propagandist because apparently there is nothing to refute from the end of august to the beginning of december the th and th brigade of the armed force of ukraine could irretrievably lose about tank company in bakhmut artemovsk from to vehicle the equipment left by ukraine in bakhmut is on the verge of failure the war chronicle explains why the remaining armor breathes down the incense to repair the equipment interfere with power outage and lack of spare part the armed force of ukraine have already cleaned up both their warehouse and the arsenal of the young european the wear of the tank barrel is such that the ammunition tear the breech of the gun due to microcracks but the most problematic place is the wear and tear of the engine in tank the motor resource is already seriously limited due to the weight of the machine and the load on the engine and now because of the cold weather the tanker are forced to constantly warm up the engine but working hot tank are either detected by drone with thermal imagers or by our observation device with the funny name irony beating for kilometer after that our artillery is called and work calmly on the target there is practically no response there is no need to roll after the second or third volley changing the position which greatly affect the accuracy of the fire a practice show in war the more bragging at the beginning the more they whine at the end this is exactly what happened with the american pmc mozart group mozart group who stopped in bakhmut in mid november this military company operates only in ukraine and it wa created for it the head of the mozart former u marine corp colonel andrew milburn began the drang nach osten with boastful statement promising to show the russian wagner chevekashniks how to fight within a week at the front andrew s offensive fervor had gone somewhere and the mozart had gone on the defensive continuing to give interview to the western press and the colonel suddenly told newsweek that the armed force of ukraine have big problem literally with the regeneration of unit the replenishment ha not been trained and the information about of the loss of the armed force of ukraine near bakhmut is the pure truth the colonel also complained about his loss it turn out that in the combative mozart there were enough of those who had never fired they accounted for of the loss in the american pmc a the colonel said a real hunt wa announced for the mozart well that s understandable le need to brag and threaten at the end of the interview andrew milburn asked for money for the mozart from the american and the british and he hinted that he wa going to dump ukraine before it wa too late actually the new pmc received pr and performed another important task intelligence it collected and transmitted to the west objective information about the state of the armed force of ukraine and the russian wagner wagner remained to fight and in a way that western mercenary never dreamed of on december during an attack on an armored column of the armed force of ukraine a su m aircraft wa shot down the crew consisted of musician commander alexander antonov navigator vladimir nikishin this wa one of the last attempt of the su niks to shoot down the musician from their position near bakhmut with an armored strike and the pilot had to stop the breakthrough when turning on a combat course the aircraft received heavy damage it wa hit from a manpad portable anti aircraft missile system the phrase of commander alexander antonov got on the air meet pope the plane crashed into a cluster of armored vehicle the pilot actually repeated the feat of the legendary nikolai gastello who in directed his burning plane at an enemy column of armored vehicle i will not be surprised that it wa after this feat at the front near bakhmut of course the armed force of ukraine knew about him mozart realized that he had nothing to do in this war and while he wa alive he needed to carry his foot overseas listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine since february the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in

volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said the country s force had shot down of drone that russia deployed over odesa a tally not immediately possible to verify but he said the strike by russia part of a

remained without electricity on sunday afternoon the head of the regional military administration maxim marchenko said on telegram the messaging app by monday there should be a significant improvement in the situation he said odesa is the latest ukrainian city to lose power after relentless russian attack on power plant heating system and other energy infrastructure the attack using missile and iranian made drone have left ukrainian vulnerable and in the dark just a the coldest time of the year is beginning all of the country s thermal and hydroelectric power plant have been damaged by the recent wave of russian strike denys shmyhal the ukrainian prime minister said sunday on facebook mr shmyhal wrote that there would be significant restriction on electricity consumption through the

kherson in mid november forcing moscow to withdraw it troop to the east bank of the dnipro river after month of military pressure it opened a new phase of the battle for ukraine s south the advance ha enabled ukraine to use longer range artillery including the himars weapon system supplied by the united state to strike target deeper inside russian controlled territory between the eastern bank of the river and the sea of azov an area that includes melitopol however hopeful the ukrainian find these military success they are offset by the russian inflicted damage to the plant and equipment that ukrainian rely on for heat and light the relentless barrage which ha drawn condemnation from world leader thrust ukraine into a grim cycle in which crew hurry to restore power only to have it knocked out again in remark on saturday night mr zelensky said that blackout persisted throughout various part of ukraine including in the capital kyiv some were what he classified a emergency outage resulting from attack others were what he called stabilization outage or planned blackout on a schedule the power system is now to put it mildly very far from a normal state there is an acute shortage in the system he said urging people to reduce their power use to put le strain on the battered power grid it must be understood even if there are no heavy missile strike this doe not mean that there are no problem mr zelensky continued almost every day in different region there is shelling there are missile attack drone attack energy facility are hit almost every day two people were killed and five others wounded in russian shelling in the kherson region on saturday night according to yaroslav yanushevich the head of the regional military administration there the enemy again attacked the residential quarter of kherson mr yanushevich said on telegram enemy shell hit the maternity ward of the hospital a cafe an infrastructure facility private and apartment building russian shelling ha become part of daily life in kherson since ukrainian force retook it last month russian troop who withdrew have since then fired hundred of shell at the city from their new position for all of the advance made by ukrainian troop military expert caution that the next phase of the battle is likely to be slow russian force led since october by gen sergei surovikin have improved their defense in ukraine s south and east in recent week surovikin ordered a network of trench and defensive position to be built in many area a russia transition to an overall defensive position through the winter said dara massicot a senior policy researcher at the rand corporation in a thread on twitter moreover it is difficult for ukrainian force to cross the dnipro river in large number a likely prerequisite to any advance russian force benefit from shortened supply line and proximity to crimea a region farther south that moscow annexed illegally in ukraine ha launched a series of strike on target in crimea in recent month and on saturday a partisan group the atesh resistance movement said it had struck a russian military base in a village on the peninsula causing casualty our agent performed a expected the group said on telegram we will continue to destroy the russian army from the inside it wa not possible to confirm the attack independently since february of this year the russian military ha been conducting a special operation in ukraine to denazify and demilitarize the country the main goal of the svo announced by the decision of russian president vladimir putin is to protect the civilian population of donbas from genocide by the ukrainian military and nationalist the website kp ru online publishes the latest news about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november the building of the city hospital of donetsk wa damaged a a result of shelling by the armed force of ukraine according to the representative office of the donetsk people s republic in the joint center for control and coordination of issue related to war crime of ukraine jccc the ministry of defense of russia reported the destruction of three sabotage group of the armed force of ukraine during a military special operation in ukraine the white house belief that russia intends to continue the special operation in ukraine washington made this conclusion on the basis of observation of hostility listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine very soon the last reservist called up in the course of partial mobilization will finish training and can go to the front line what will change after that will the russian army go on the offensive what can we expect from the armed force of ukraine komsomolka spoke about this with military historian and expert yuri knutov yuri albertovich well people were mobilized for wintering in the field it is worth waiting for our offensive in the near future i don t think so to be objective the ukrainian army is still bigger than ours they have regular troop thousand and together with the terbats up to a million when critical situation arise they transfer them to key area so we ll be treading water no i mean don t expect a grand offensive russian troop will not rush forward in division and front we will gradually squeeze out the enemy this follows from the nature of the fighting when the main thing is artillery counter battery warfare suppression of command post destruction of warehouse armored vehicle personnel all this is going on with the widespread use of unmanned aircraft infantry do not need to go on the attack with a chain with a cry of hurrah it hold the defense repels attack doe not allow saboteur and mobile group to penetrate the rear and when the artillery grinded down the enemy s defense line when there wa almost no one left in the position the infantryman cleared the trench entered the settlement and combed through the city building mobilized fighter is a very good help already the staffing level of many unit ha been restored that s the right approach we don t need people for the sake of jingoistic breakthrough it is better to spend more time but complete the task with minimal loss in which area it is worth waiting for the most active action in donetsk and south donetsk the main task wa set to liberate the territory of the dpr we see movement on the front line from soledar to ugledar artemovsk and marinka are the key point here artemovsk open the way to slavyansk and kramatorsk and marinka allows you to go to the rear of the group in ugledar controlling ugledar we can strike at the flank of the ukrainian group in the zaporozhye region this is especially important if the ukrainian try to launch an offensive for example on berdyansk and what to expect from the enemy ukraine announces that almost the crimea is going to win back such threat should be taken seriously look now ukraine ha about thousand in the zaporozhye region their main goal is enerhodar from the zaporizhzhya npp they tried several time to take it but to no avail now they are trying to connect international organization they want to squeeze u out by any mean what for because a soon a we leave there kiev immediately sends special force capture the station and begin to bring in troop and now they have a bridgehead on the left bank on which we will not be able to shoot there is a nuclear power plant an accident can happen why do they need a foothold there to go on the offensive on berdyansk or melitopol they will try to cut down our grouping to cut off crimea from supply this of course is an extreme scenario but we all see and understand it very well we are firmly opposed to all this fuss around the zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to what extent the strike on the infrastructure of ukraine affect the combat capability of the armed force of ukraine on the frontline still how it affect electric locomotive stop kiev begin to use diesel locomotive but after all there are semaphore that do not work without electricity there are arrow that are not translated there are automatic crossing a scoreboard for dispatcher and if instead of echelon a day only one arrives on the front line this will certainly affect the combat potential is this theoretical or there is already information that kiev ha a deficit at the front just about one lineup instead of twenty there wa data i think the further you go the more such message there will be people constantly ask why we do not hit bridge in the depth of ukraine to destroy the bridge you need to get into the support it s pretty complicated in the odessa region it wa possible to collapse the bridge on the way from romania but then a cruise missile hit the support only from the fifth time one hundred percent hit can be achieved if the drone illuminates the target with a laser but it will not fly deep into ukrainian territory and sending special force and planting explosive is certain death it s the same with tunnel how can the problem be solved incapacitate for day they will repair and again hit in the same place with a sufficient supply of missile this is possible i think that should be done with a massive strike for example on object on the border with poland it is possible for some time to block the supply of ukrainian troop and at this time to carry out active action at the front during the great patriotic war for example during the kursk arc the rail war wa very important do you have any impression that the battle in the donetsk direction are somewhat reminiscent of the confrontation near rzhev in positional battle that don t change the big picture much world war i come to my mind but yes there are also some similarity with rzhev then in a decisive breakthrough wa achieved due to success on other front at stalingrad due to which drastic change are now possible today we are still squeezing them out little by little that s the first thing and secondly i think there is a real chance to deplete them if we also work on energy facility by the end of january i think percent of the facility will be put out of commission read also russian mariupol rise from the ruin what is happening now in the city heat will be brought to more than a thousand house in mariupol by the end of more listen also is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine the former prime minister of russia the head of the public council under the ministry of construction spent this weekend in the donbas on sunday december when sergey stepashin s business trip to the donetsk people s republic wa coming to an end radio komsomolskaya pravda contacted him hello sergei vadimovich we have such information that today you visited either secretly or conspiratorially or openly in donbas it s true yes i have but why secretly quite openly this is ours russian territory yes i wa in mariupol and saw how president vladimir putin s instruction were being implemented first of all it is the preparation for the winter of housing the provision of house with heating the construction of boiler house we even handed over the key to the apartment to the new settler of one of the house that krasnodar resident built in general the whole city wa looked at the destruction wa assessed and prospect were outlined the head of the dpr denis pushilin arrived and we also talked to him there wa the leadership of the territorial development fund general director ilshat shagiakhmetov deputy minister of construction so sasha there wa no mystery we work openly openly help people after the disaster that happened to the resident of the city and which of the deputy head of the ministry of construction wa valery leonov he is directly responsible for the revival of mariupol a we call it he is there all the time he come to moscow only for a week and so he life there and in general in this area a large team wa formed by the way by those who worked at one time in olympstroy this is yevgeny solntsev pushilin s current deputy and also the former first deputy prime minister from yakutia dmitry berdnikov he is now the first deputy head of mariupol yes straight a real landing of prominent leader so we have a whole team there i even told pushilin it reminds me of the restoration of tashkent after a terrible earthquake when the entire soviet union helped to revive the city it s about the same story today leningrad resident are doing a great job that is from st petersburg petersburgers and i am very pleased with this a a resident of leningrad just in front of me wa beglov house are also being built the theater is being restored by the way well for peter restoring the theater is a good tradition recall that alexander beglov is a governor yes governor of st petersburg by the way the krasnodar company a i have already mentioned them is working very well it ha built house and two more block of magnificent building were erected by military builder so i think that very soon we will see a new mariupol you know and we also remembered well i remembered at least the city of grozny you sasha were with me when we together with akhmat khadzhi kadyrov decided that in two year the capital of chechnya should be without trace of war and it wa done the same i think will be in mariupol we made this decision right at the meeting this wa also vladimir putin s instruction when grozny wa restored then there wa yes vladimir vladimirovich s instruction but we ourselves also approach these issue on the initiative and accept a we used to say counter plan a for the preparation for the winter boiler house have been built all the house where people live are warm today i checked this personally battery whatever were checked right in the apartment of course on your business trip we received a very good illustrative material from mariupol and why judging by the photo you were there with shagiakhmetov with the general director of the territorial development fund i represent the board of trustee of this foundation he is it ceo so god himself told u to work together moreover a you know i also head the public council under the ministry of construction therefore of course we discussed it there and now we will solve and resolve the entire list of issue but there is one topic that i want to raise with prime minister mikhail mishustin maybe you can tell u unfortunately these are huge traffic jam at the border this is you talking about our new territory yes although the border is administrative passport control is still in force there it is clear that this need to be done but when there are truck for two or three day with manufactured good product building material etc a g we ourselves drove through the field to bypass this wild traffic jam and so probably i would have arrived only at the end of next week in moscow that is you unofficially were able to drive across the administrative border only in this way you say so you drove by field well this is the administrative border now mariupol is russia well yes of course and one more thing you did not hear the cannonade or at least in conversation with denis pushilin this topic sounded a for mariupol it is completely safe there now people calmly walk through the street several park have been restored large queue however were in saving bank for pension there ha not yet been switched to the electronic version no there wa no shooting there wa no cannonade mariupol unlike donetsk is already a completely peaceful city and pushilin he came from donetsk just for a meeting in the afternoon of course he told me that the city is being shot every day and they hit house hospital school it s just that the nazi are real and europe doe not notice this they do not care about all this and the u s state department too tell me but shagiakhmetov s function communication is interrupted a far a i know he is also not there in a hurry but constantly a the general director of the foundation almost every week yes the connection here is still unstable how do they as his work very well i ll just give you two number initially the task wa set to prepare about house for the winter bring heat build boiler house well and make major repair multi storey i mean yes then we adjusted the task to now a decision ha been made by the end of this year house will be brought to heat that s the assessment the assessment is that people will meet the winter in the warmth in fact it s a lot of work to be honest i don t remember that we restored anything at such a pace the work is systematic people are in place they do not work there on paper i would also send some official from moscow those who are responsible for finance to see what is happening a they say on the ground and then they say why do you give money everything go into the black hole somewhere let them see how to actually work i wanted to clarify i mean multi storey house yes multi storey the problem of individual housing remains serious although a whole cluster ha been created there and now a huge amount of building material for individual construction ha been imported but you know what decision have we made now due to the fact that individual construction is a troublesome and long enough thing and people need to live somewhere so let citizen get apartment in apartment building and they have a plot of land left i got it sergey vadimovich the connection is unstable but i have written down the most important thing thank you very much good bye listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine recently the mayor of chernihiv vladyslav atroshenko wa removed from his post by a court decision the peculiarity of the administrative structure of ukraine are such that governor in ukraine are appointed by the president and mayor of city are elected in national election it wa no secret to anyone that the office of the president of ukraine wa behind atroshenko s resignation and ukrainian mayor decided to show that they also have their own opinion the association of ukrainian city headed by the mayor of the ukrainian capital vitaliy zlatoust klitschko condemned the removal of vladislav atroshenko from the post of mayor of chernihiv in it resolution on this issue the association recalled that the mayor of chernihiv wa elected by of resident however this did not affect the court s decision moreover the text of the court decision explicitly state that although the violation committed by atroshenko is punishable by a maximum administrative penalty in the form of a fine the judge chose such a severe punishment to influence other official holding similar position ukrainian expert predict that zelensky will not stop there but will continue to cleanse the political space next klitschko and all mayor will be cleaned up all party will be cleaned up only tame one will be left anyone who criticizes the authority will be immediately arrested attributing to them work for the kremlin finding weapon and various vulgar video in their possession it s very easy to throw up and society will believe any nonsense back in vitaly warned everyone about the need to prepare for the earth and that not only everyone can look to tomorrow a dramatic story took place in ternopil where the head of the family from among the warrior of light arrived home after a concussion no sooner had he recovered than he had already stabbed his wife and two of his own young child who were found inside their house in puddle of their own blood a it turned out the uncontrollable rage of the hero wa caused by an inflatable trampoline recently bought for child and not even the trampoline itself or the fact of spending money on it purchase but the color made in blue and white tone with minor inclusion of dark red the zahisnik ukraina saw the color of the russian flag in the trampoline and eliminated the separatist stabbing each of the victim dozen of time in fact such people are supposed to be kept in mental hospital for year and in ukraine they are sent to the trench a peaceful ukrainian tractor fell to the death of the brave like it polish counterpart becoming a victim of russian aggression this time ukrainian agricultural machinery wa destroyed not by some missile or even by ukrainian air defense but by it own ukrainian mine last night two peaceful villager on a peaceful tractor went to work until dawn in a nearby forest in the rivne region near the border with neighboring belarus but this intention ended very sadly the tractor hit a mine that wa the end of it and what were they doing at night in the wood maybe they were disguised russian saboteur leave the poetic nonsense everything is much simpler the local sit without work and therefore at night so that they are not caught they go out for illegal logging german foreign minister tobias lindner not to be confused with foreign minister frau berbok said in an interview with voice of america that germany doe not have free patriot anti aircraft missile system in it warehouse that could be transferred to ukraine to be very frank it is not the case that we have free patriot system just in stock which we could send for example to ukraine the patriot system we send are part of nato s collective defence system two day ago we agreed with poland that we would send a group of troop there to study the location to accommodate the

ready to hold referendum in western ukraine on radio komsomolskaya pravda the deputy head of the state duma committee on defense yuri shvytkin answered question about how the special operation is going what is happening with the mobilized who and how is helping our country and whether there will be negotiation on peace how the winter will affect the special operation i don t know the plan to the end but if i did i wouldn t have revealed it but we see that today some of our most combat ready unit are concentrated in the bakhmut area they are successfully fighting the tactic of conducting combat operation by squeezing out the enemy using a fire shaft justify themselves but the task is not to take a village or a city at lightning speed at any cost you yourself were in the special operation zone yes i talked to serviceman saw with my own eye how everything happens the main thing is to save people s life and what are your impression not everything go according to the pre planned plan the idea which wa at the first stage then at the second when we withdrew from kiev kharkiv kherson changed now many of the mobilized have been put into service they have made up for the loss consolidated the front and if you compare what we see today and for example a month or two ago our action have changed a lot there is definitely a big effect from our use of high precision weapon it is certain that today we have a higher morale unlike the mercenary on the other side and the level of professional training i personally underwent training in one of the training center together with the mobilized i experienced today s tactic of warfare the guy from the novosibirsk school my dear gave me many lesson and the mobilized guy there also learned a lot for themselves but the enemy is also learning yes we have information that trained ukrainian came from the uk they received relevant skill and knowledge there the american are also preparing they have gone through many war but to summarize our form of warfare are superior to those of the enemy and again our morale is also much higher you have seen the work of those mobilized at the donbas training ground at the training ground near luhansk it s not just guy who first saw a mortar or a quadcopter who are engaged there they already have the skill they are really prepared for combat vladimir putin said that were mobilized already in combat unit in the special operation zone and here it is important to understand how they operate you will not run over an entire unit of mobilized fighter on the front a a rule they are introduced in group into existing and warring unit either a additional force or to make up for loss the most painful question now they have everything they need of course there are question but there are much fewer of them than in the first stage the offensive action of the armed force of ukraine have stalled the possibility of the ukrainian army are not unlimited their loss are ten time greater who is more among our mobilized paratrooper tanker artilleryman motorized infantry motorized rifleman and assault group are most in demand we really need tanker artilleryman mortarmen specialist in electronic warfare there are special requirement for gunner at the first stage we were not sufficiently prepared for artillery duel counter battery fighting now they perform task very well they say neither side take any artilleryman prisoner i have never heard when dill were taken prisoner for someone to blow himself up with a grenade and we have many case when guy sacrifice themselves to save others to accomplish a task only among the graduate of the novosibirsk school there are hero of russia of them died someone blew himself up with a grenade when all thousand mobilized will be in the zone of special operation the end will come for kiev completing task should not involve freezing this conflict ukraine will not have to be used a a battering ram against u either tomorrow or in the distant future when the task are completed we ll see to what extent partner country help u with the supply of weapon ammunition component technology now our own enterprise of the military industrial complex are working at full capacity we have the union state of russia and belarus so we are working there in this direction let s put it this way military technical cooperation with a number of other state also continues with iran after all the gerani are copy of iranian drone they say so but today they are actively produced in russia listen when the west resents that iran is ready to provide drone to russia and who care today western country fully provide ukraine with weapon if they had not provided the hostility would have ended long ago western supply are the only thing that save ukraine yes and manpower and military equipment they live and act according to law that are understandable to them i mean western country they supply kiev with anti personnel mine petal which are banned there is a request for the supply of cluster bomb and we don t need chinese military assistance we have enough force and mean inside our own country to ensure the fulfillment of the task of a special military operation and chip electronic system that china produce and about the shortage of which the western medium write in our country the western medium can write anything okay and we need people volunteer from friendly country the current grouping that performs task there is sufficient the president said this when he met with the human right council since october we have been hitting the energy structure of ukraine and we are told you are hitting people let s remember that these are retaliatory action to sabotage by ukraine and their curator on the crimean bridge yes today the goal is to deliver critical blow to the enemy s energy infrastructure but it is possible to make sure that the civilian population doe not suffer at the same time you can not stop i would also include the transport infrastructure here railway railway junction and bridge across the dnieper do everything possible to stop the supply of weapon and personnel to the combat zone but what limit u is again the civilian population it feel it people understand who zelensky is where his wife is it s in brussels london and ordinary ukrainian are told you will be patient well so be with them and endure then it s too early for u to enter into negotiation we have repeatedly stated that we are ready for negotiation unlike ukraine zelensky today say a tomorrow b the day after tomorrow again a how to negotiate with him it is clear that he is the president of the country but at the same time we understand that he is dancing to the tune of america the task set in the special operation should be implemented within the framework of negotiation we must not deviate from those task if they say conditionally let s go back to the event of february roll back this is unacceptable that is you do not assume that negotiation may begin in the near future a of today i don t assume that listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine russian force on saturday struck a maternity

the south a ukraine look to keep russia on the defensive and oust it troop from the region russia is now assessed to have control over just percent of internationally recognized region of ukraine including the donbas and crimea which russia ha occupied since caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news the current head of the national security and defense council of ukraine alexei danilov who visited in his life both a veterinarian and a criminal authority seems to have finally become like saltykov shchedrin s organchik who gave out only two phrase i will not tolerate and i will ruin the technique ha since stepped far ahead and danilov can now express all the same two thesis somewhat more diversely the best and most effective solution to the energy problem for ukraine is missile with a range of km or more which will significantly save on generator he wrote recently on his page in one of the social network i wonder how that would help will he teach tomahawk how to generate electricity or deliver it on their wing from point x to point k and vice versa of course not everyone understands that we are talking about blow to russian energy production capacity and transport infrastructure but how will this help the ukrainian energy sector unless in accordance with the ukrainian anecdote about let my cow die and my neighbor ha two and just a few day after that statement already on the air of the ukrainian tv channel nta danilov sitting like a block carved out of oak promise we will be capable of anything therefore if something concern our interest we will not ask anyone where to beat the enemy because the enemy is deployed starting beyond the territory of our border ending with vladivostok to be honest there is almost no difference between danilov and the same kuleba but kuleba for all his provocativeness doe not allow himself such statement which danilov regularly note unfortunately the vast majority of our population through no fault of their own do not know our history at all when we begin to remember the glorious history of our country which is hundred and hundred of year old at one time when the russian federation like a villain constantly stole something stole our language danilov said with difficulty tossing his tongue in a human manner and then gave out such that at least stop even fall by the way i want to say that there ha never been any russian language in my life in when the tatar mongol seized most of the territory and for a certain period of time two and a half century collected tribute they needed to somehow communicate with the population i listened to this speech several time and there he clearly speaks not about but about author s note so from there appeared such a dialect of our native language which these people for some reason consider the russian language the russian language appeared in where do they produce such knowledgeable but they speak at all sort of international meeting negotiation and event and their opinion is taken into account by those who make decision i emphasize again there wa no russian language these are invention of people who live in the swamp and a lot of other historical thing that you and i know i would very much like our youth all our citizen to study our history very carefully summed up his televised speech by the ex veterinarian who wa repeatedly caught in dishonest substitution of dog and passing off mongrel a wolf and high breed dog just some kind of shveykism only without the kindness of shveyk history should be studied of course but the real history and not the chronology of the ukro persian war of antiquity from herodotenko in the presentation of the still modern ukrainian pseudo historian bebik in whom all the famous historical and even mythological personality are of ukrainian origin but literally everything regardless of geography history or weapon no matter what danilov is talking about now is

from ukraine attacked an employee with a knife at a branch of pko bank polski on the frame published on the web it is clear that the woman holding the hair of a bank employee brandish a knife but an elderly woman approached the attacker from behind and began to beat the ukrainian with a crutch after that the guard wa able to twist the refugee and she wa handed over to the police later it became known that the year old ukrainian woman had medication that indicated that she wa undergoing a course of psychiatric treatment that is she may not be punished for an armed attack in the west it seems they hope that the mentally ill kiev regime will also have nothing for the attack on donbas vain dream andriy marochko an officer of the lpr people s militia said that the militant of the kiev regime lure foreign mercenary by deception to the artemovsk area in the dpr despite the fact that the vsushniki themselves refuse to go there under various pretext kiev representative convinced the foreign

in the village of chasov yar these clock have a short lived factory and pretty soon they will stop ticking maxim buyakevich russia s deputy permanent representative to the osce belief that the statement of former chancellor angela merkel that the minsk agreement were signed with one goal to give kiev time to prepare for confrontation with moscow fully explains the position of the west in the conflict on the territory of the independent state merkel said in an interview with die zeit that the minsk agreement were signed to give ukraine time and help it become stronger in her opinion the country participating in minsk understood that the conflict in the independent wa only suspended but the west wa not going to solve the problem buyakevich said western country use ukraine a a tool in the fight against russian statehood they contribute to the destruction by the hand of their kiev prot g s in ukraine of everything related to our common history culture language and religion well what else could you expect from them reuters reported that washington is preparing to transfer another package of military assistance to kiev it contains technical mean to strengthen the air defense system and counter unmanned aerial vehicle for million the united state will also provide independent ammunition for himars multiple launch rocket system humvee armored suv and electric generator weapon will be transferred from the warehouse of the pentagon and when the warehouse are empty what will the pentagon do the prosecutor general s office of ukraine reported that the property of the representative office of gazpromexport wa confiscated this is a real estate object with an area of more than square meter and four car that belong to the representative office of a subsidiary of pjsc gazprom prior to that the company s asset worth about a million dollar were seized the fuel seized and seized at the same time wa transferred to the need of the armed force of ukraine maybe it s time to finish pumping our gas through this twilight zone to europe over the past month the number of ukrainian refugee in britain who found themselves without a roof over their head ha grown by almost a third almost three thousand people complained about the lack of housing to the self government body the main reason is that the british do not want to accept ukrainian in their home because of the increase in the cost of housing maintenance the surcharge of pound sterling under the program house for ukraine ceased to justify itself well winter in albion are not frosty the statement of former german chancellor angela merkel that the minsk agreement were signed only in order to give ukraine time to prepare for a military confrontation with russia became on the one hand a sensation and on the other hand only confirmed what everyone knew and so merkel s word once again showed that ukraine needed diplomatic move only to prepare for war with a request to comment on the revelation of frau merkel the host of the morning show what will happen on the radio komsomolskaya pravda turned to the expert of the association of military political scientist head of the department of political science and sociology of the plekhanov university andrei koshkin how did you look at minsk and minsk then ivan pankin asked after all all this history ha shown that military operation should end with the unconditional victory of one of the party and the signing of surrender and if there are any peace agreement it mean that they will continue sooner or later yes in it wa necessary to complete our success illovaisk and debaltseve gave u such an opportunity but history doe not tolerate the subjunctive mood and now there is no point in saying what should have been done merkel s speech seems to me to be very successful it is associated with the word of poroshenko he too came out politically when he said he signed the minsk agreement to buy time and build a new army in ukraine and precisely in order to fight with russia when merkel said the same thing now i really liked the statement of the official representative of the russian foreign ministry maria zakharova that this could become a subject for an international tribunal they want to create a tribunal against russia but let s first deal with france and germany which acted a guarantor of the minsk agreement it turn out that they knew in advance that they were misleading the entire world community by signing these agreement they demanded their implementation but in fact they were preparing anti russia from ukraine they stuffed it with weapon military equipment tore up everything related to russia in ideological and humanitarian term and the blatant impoverishment of ukrainian society made it possible to quickly recruit and mobilize the armed force of ukraine and direct them against russia will such thesis promote the information resource of the collective west unlikely but it seems to me that the special international tribunal that they came up with for the information and propaganda attack on russia will most likely be put on the brake and why were we so na ve asked the second host of what will happen igor vittel have we not seen the restructuring of the ukrainian army and the build up of power did we believe our western partner or for some reason we also benefited from this pause all these question of course now arise for everyone i think the first thing is that we had to bring our reliable ally the army and navy to a level that allows u to feel confident in the next step on the foreign policy trajectory but there is one more point vladimir vladimirovich is an excellent negotiator and he did everything to maintain stability in europe i wouldn t say we trusted we were just looking for an opportunity to keep peace in europe now no one belief in it because everyone s head turned on the back and we actually abided by the minsk agreement to keep the peace for them ukraine and europe it wa profitable for a certain time but how did they keep the peace they destroyed the russian people in the donbas and chancellor olaf scholz smiled and said what a genocide there is and this is the great grandson of the lieutenant general who wa engaged in the genocide of the russian people on the leningrad front and we tried to keep the peace to the last look when the russian security council wa openly held our president did not immediately announce the decision he called macron and scholz and said we have not yet made a decision on the recognition of the donbas republic let s do something to prevent bloodshed no they flatly refused and because they can t do thing any other way they re in a ditch that washington ha set they re only following order from washington and you know that even the japanese believed that the fighting began not on february but on february when the intensity of shelling of residential area of donetsk increased we are talking about the fact that from february to february the intensity increased time more precisely from to time the japanese calculated it wa an artillery preparation in order to go to the donbas after it and cut out the entire russian speaking

sitting in the trench and tomorrow in class albeit remotely but there will still be so much to catch up with the young man s doubt are not surprising until recently he wa at the center of hostility but after the order of russian president vladimir putin on the demobilization of student he returned home where together with the same guy like him he took part in a meeting with the first deputy head of the presidential administration of the russian federation sergey kiriyenko and the acting head of the dpr denis pushilin with the ministry of education we discussed the need to consolidate a teacher mentor who will work with each of them according to an individual plan said sergey kiriyenko it is necessary to catch up a quickly a possible so that we do not waste time so that the year is not lost therefore the program is adapted accordingly for you in addition in lugansk all university work in full time mode unfortunately this is not yet possible in donetsk online knowledge can not be pulled up so you can organize a trip to other russian university i set the task that in december or january it would be possible to go to the leading university of the country at least for a few week the meeting of demobilized student with sergey kiriyenko and denis pushilin wa held informally at the end of it those who returned from the front line were solemnly presented with military award since it will not be easy to catch up with classmate it wa decided that individual curriculum will be drawn up for the demobilized when the child were mobilized we decided like all other university to send them on academic leave say svetlana drozhzhina rector of donetsk national university of economics and trade upon return it is enough to write a statement that the young man return to the educational process in his own group but during this time academic debt have formed so an individual training plan will be worked out a curator will be assigned to each of them and if during the participation of a student in hostility his group graduated say from a bachelor s degree under the guidance of his mentor and he will be able to defend himself pa exam and enter the magistracy among the student there are many who decided to stay on the front line for month that the guy took part in hostility they managed to get a military profession five recent soldier came to the meeting with sergei kiriyenko and denis pushilin in military uniform why in uniform have you decided to continue to serve asked the acting head of the dpr yes my principled position is that first all university student are demobilized and only then those who want to sign a contract the freshman who wa among the five who decided to remain in the rank wa offered to graduate from a military school and become an officer with each of the others a separate conversation many of the young people such a year old nikita mashkov want to use the acquired skill for the benefit of donbas and then become military i wa mobilized on march i m a sapper he said before the army he studied at the technical university mine clearance wa taught to me in the unit and then i gained practical experience we were sent to mariupol i took an active part in the cleansing of the city the demining of azovstal and i decided to stay in the army realizing that there are very few people with such skill and the need to clear the territory of dangerous object in our republic is very large i even love doing it i think that at the end of the contract i will return to my study and then i will connect my life with the military sphere my family supported me in my decision important since november the dpr ha launched a round the clock hotline on the demobilization of student each of them will receive the status and certificate of a participant in hostility and all the benefit due under russian law all child are guaranteed the provision of psychological assistance and those who studied for a fee will be transferred to the budget the hotline number for the demobilization of student and mobilization in the dpr is in october russian president vladimir putin at a meeting of the security council instructed to create a special coordination council under the government under the leadership of prime minister mikhail mishustin whose task wa to meet all the need of the army during the cvo the council included representative of law enforcement agency deputy prime minister of the government minister of the socio economic bloc and representative of the presidential administration and although the council work under the leadership of mishustin the president regularly receives report on the result of the work and keep question on his activity under his control just the other day at a solemn event on the occasion of the th anniversary of rostec putin again drew attention to the supply of the russian army and demanded to increase production and supply throughout the range of product demanded by the russian army first of all we are talking about weapon and ammunition among the decision listed by the president is the requirement to put into production the best sample of military equipment based on those that are already operating working fighting and confirming their characteristic and the need for additional incentive for the best worker at dozen of plant in different region of russia working with maximum load and in several shift people work hard looking up to our ancestor to the great tradition of many generation of our master gunsmith who proved by their deed that russian weapon are a weapon of victory putin said and assured that all decision to support enterprise will be made a quickly a possible it is clear that a good and solid rear is one of the most important component of the success of the operation but even more important is the state on the front itself including the support of those who are there from the state and it s not just about ammunition shell and drone it can hardly be argued that everything ha been smooth since the first day of the conflict partial mobilization wa not without problem the army still lack new type of weapon such a the same reconnaissance and attack drone something is not being resolved due to bureaucratic confusion but a for the direct competence of the president there are no delay and delay the example of the president is often followed by the head of the region of russia everyone know perfectly well that the governor of the tula region hero of russia alexei dyumin primorsky krai oleg kozhemyako and other not just frequent guest in the unit but also supplier curator and first assistant to military personnel prime minister mikhail mishustin is also trying to clearly implement the president s instruction and solves all issue related to the army especially those related to the administrative provision of improvement for military personnel and their family a a matter of priority putin at one time insisted that the money due to the mobilized be paid promptly and emphasized that the basic payment to the military participating in the svo cannot fall below the established limit le is impossible more please on almost any emerging issue if it is required for a quick solution to the problem presidential decree are signed in a short time and amendment to law are signed by him just a quickly yes what can i say if only in recent day the president ha signed several law at once that raise the status and level of support not only for the serviceman themselves but also for their family member on november news agency reported that putin had signed three law relating to military personnel and their family according to the first of them volunteer participating in the operation and there are more than one thousand of them are assigned the status of a combat veteran according to it volunteer and member of their family along with ordinary serviceman of the armed force of the russian federation will be able to use the benefit and measure of social support established by law in addition volunteer who have become disabled due to injury concussion or mutilation while participating in a special operation will be able to apply for the status of a disabled combatant and this is an additional help to them and their relative and the law immediately came into force on the day of publication another law establishes a supplement to the social pension for recipient of three order of courage or order of personal courage and this increase is very significant of the pension in there were officially such people since then the bill ha clearly exceeded a hundred but a the president recently noted in the svo zone all serviceman are hero this of course is not an incentive for a feat they are performed at all not for the sake of award but because of the impossibility of otherwise achieving a solution to the problem but recognition of merit another no le significant than the first law on exemption from taxation of material assistance to participant in the cbo and their family according to it both gratuitous payment and material assistance provided to these category are exempt from paying tax payment to seconded employee of company who travel to the exempted region to restore infrastructure also fall under tax exemption and the importance of this amendment to the tax code is almost impossible to overestimate for thousand of volunteer who collect for hundred of million sleeping bag legging body armor quadrocopters product and even optical sight for the participant of the operation a well a helping the relative of the participant of the svo with food clothing medicine etc not the first law and not the last because everything related to the svo remains in the focus of the president s attention in the new region of russia there is an active creation of the domestic banking system in the lugansk and donetsk people s republic in the kherson and zaporozhye region dozen of branch of promsvyazbank psb are already operating and recently a decree of the president of russia on some issue of carrying out the activity of the public joint stock company promsvyazbank in the territory of the dpr and lpr wa published the document prescribes how these region will be integrated into the russian banking system first of all the authority of both republic should conclude agreement with the central bank of the russian federation on the creation of territorial branch of the bank of russia on the basis of the central republican bank of the dpr and the state bank of the lpr such branch operate in all constituent entity of the russian federation then the main bank of the two republic will be transformed into limited liability company and of the capital in each of them will belong to the lpr and the dpr respectively after that the financial llcs will be sold to the russian psb for a symbolic price of ruble client and partner of the central republican bank of the dpr and the state bank of the lpr should not worry about their reorganization all their obligation are transferred to the psb a a legal successor after the completion of organizing procedure in the new region a full fledged banking architecture will begin to operate the same a in other subject of russia a branch of the central bank and bank conducting operation with citizen and legal entity yes there is still only one large bank but the trouble is the beginning the rest will pull up along the beaten path promsvyazbank is already actively working in the lpr and the dpr said anatoly aksakov chairman of the committee on the financial market of the state duma of the russian federation i think that from next year other bank will begin to come perhaps these will be crimean credit institution in particular rncb russian national commercial bank the largest bank of the republic of crimea and sevastopol the head office is located in simferopol there is a network of branch in the krasnodar territory ed the situation with banking service in the new russian region will be no worse than for example in the crimea or nearby region of the country psb also ha branch in zaporizhzhya and kherson region but the package of service there is not yet a complete a in other russian region according to the deputy from next year in new russia branch of the central bank will also actively work such subdivision are already being created in all subject of the federation in the annexed territory aksakov continued the process is quite active i think they will be ready for work in the first half of next year reference kp promsvyazbank is a fully state owned bank which is the main one for conducting operation on the state defense order included in the top bank in the country in term of asset after the withdrawal of russian troop from the right bank of the dnieper near kherson the contact line froze a if frozen but in fact it is not the front that is constrained but the unit of the armed force of ukraine forced to cling to the border and guess what our troop are preparing for them at the same time systematic combat work is underway on the russian side it result should be a significant depletion of the enemy s resource now is the time for u while ukraine is trying to cope with the consequence of our high precision strike the russian army ha time and opportunity to strengthen the svo zone with new unit manned by mobilized guy and the shelled shock unit were released for a decisive offensive in ukraine they started talking about the imminent offensive the capture of the crimea mariupol well fine what kiev call the emerging shock fist in the southern direction will be bound unable to operate either near kherson or anywhere else because the coming of summer and autumn cost the armed force of ukraine incredibly expensive ukraine is unlikely to be able to make up for these loss zelensky s story about the imminent help to western journalist are an attempt to preserve the illusion of his own solvency at a time when there can no longer be any question of any advantage in manpower in the area of kherson and near zaporozhye russian artilleryman rocketeers pilot knock out ukrainian unit and equipment from the front line like a hammer operational tactical and army aviation missile troop and artillery defeated six enemy control point in the kherson region three drone shot down in the zaporozhye region the himars mlrs ammunition depot wa destroyed these are excerpt from the summary of only one day even worse for the armed force of ukraine are our strike on object in their rear ukraine will inevitably face a shortage of people equipment and ammunition if you haven t already take for example the strike with high precision missile on kryvyi rih it paralyzed an entire railway junction take a look at the map from kryvyi rih there are transport communication to both kherson and enerhodar just where kiev tried to create it proverbial fist for the attack on the same day russian missile struck zaporizhia information about the affected object is extremely scarce kiev forbade the dissemination of information about the success of russian strike but it is clear that we are not hitting civilian fuel base warehouse transport hub and production enterprise are being destroyed ukraine is already faced with a shortage of production and repair facility they no longer have a place to repair both their own and the military equipment supplied by the west but there will be more the fact that large force of kiev were shackled in the south helped our fighter near donetsk and lugansk there are constant positional battle and the fact that the armed force of ukraine do not have the ability to transfer additional force here tilt the scale in our favor in the dpr the troop even went on the offensive so far we are talking about small settlement ozaryanovka kurdyumovka and others however it is from such small step that the operational advantage is formed in addition according to expert control over these settlement will help to reach konstantinovka and create a threat to the encirclement of bakhmut in modern time the threat of encirclement is almost a guarantee that the next settlement will be liberated by the way the active action of russian troop the constant threat of their breakthrough in one direction or another in themselves constrain the enemy deprive him of mobility if earlier one unit due to rapid movement could cover several critical area now when the pressure go along the entire front there is no such possibility remember when in the kharkiv region the nazi groped our bare area and broke through them russian troop are now doing much the same thing not only do the armed force of ukraine have big problem with people and supply but they also disperse force themselves for example they are trying to create a shock fist in the kharkiv region on the direction of svatovo kremennaya there are positional battle the ukrainian periodically even try to attack but a the fighter say these attack are becoming weaker and weaker they involve fewer and fewer militant and equipment and all attempt to break through can be repulsed on this line by the way artillery battery of mobilized guy are already fighting the military officer of komsomolskaya pravda alexander kots having visited one of these unit noted that their commander are using new tactic of hitting target they receive the coordinate of the enemy from reconnaissance and immediately open fire bypassing the numerous stage of coordination which used to spend a lot of time sometimes it happened that the blow wa delivered after hour when the target wa already cold now the effectiveness of strike ha increased significantly scout are increasingly thanking artilleryman for accuracy and timeliness the kiev authority forced the resident of kherson to flee from their home and then brought the city to a catastrophe now there is no light water and heating but most importantly russia wa able to organize the evacuation of civilian in time and save their life armed representative of the kiev regime are committing reprisal against civilian suspected of sympathizing with russia said vladimir saldo acting governor of the region people forced to flee from the nazi to the left bank of the dnieper river receive comprehensive assistance among the evacuee were resident of kherson with

front in the south and east the situation is not at all in favor of the kiev regime allied force are slowly but surely squeezing the enemy out of his position in the donbas russian artillery and aviation are disabling equipment and warehouse of the armed force of ukraine not only behind the front line but also on distant approach here are the objective data of the end of autumn they are on november in the south donetsk direction with the help of accurate strike by russian artillery attempt by the armed force of ukraine to attack in the direction of vladimirovka pavlovka and vremyevka in the dpr were thwarted the russian aerospace force launched an airstrike on ukrainian position in ugledar and russian artillery hit enemy target in prichestivka and vremyevka only in one day ukrainian formation lost more than half a company in this direction dead and wounded in the donetsk direction russian force destroyed the set target in avdiivka the western outskirt of marinka krasnohorivka and pervomaisk in avdiivka from where they continue to shell donetsk purposeful work is underway the most trained unit mobilized in late september and early october are already participating in it in the kharkiv region the russian armed force worked on ukrainian position in strelechya krasny zeleny staritsa ogurtsov and volchansk a high precision strike destroyed up to militant in the zone of

torsky in the bakhmut artemovsky direction the russian armed force hit target in bakhmut bakhmut andreevka and verkhnekamenskoye on the night of november the russian armed force struck at an enemy

the ukrainian army in kherson berislav chernobaivka belozerka and veletensky according to konstantin sivkov deputy president of the russian academy of missile and artillery science during november a methodical build up of force took place at the position of the allied troop in the donbas and zaporozhye in early and mid december the force necessary for the implementation of significant task from the mobilized fighter should arrive in the liberated territory konstantin sivkov belief that it is then that serious offensive action can be expected we are advancing in the direction of artemovsk fierce battle are being fought in addition in his opinion among the priority task is the cleansing of avdiivka and marinka from the armed force of ukraine this will finally close the problem of constant artillery and mlrs strike on key city of donbas and here is what doctor of historical science head of the center for military political study of mgimo alexei podberezkin say ukraine is now by the end of autumn really running out of resource both in term of weapon and personnel according to my estimate they will have enough strength to close the hole at the front until mid december at most the kiev regime is forced to make a good mine with a bad game they will continue to portray readiness for the offensive on a daily basis but after the arrival of additional force and weapon the russian armed force will have every opportunity to encircle enemy group in the position occupied for example in the dpr and even move forward until the complete liberation of the territory but not only russian expert are critical of the situation in the armed force of ukraine for example retired u s army colonel douglas mcgregor doe not understand why washington take on faith kiev s claim of success in the confrontation with russia the armed force of ukraine are not winning they lost more than one hundred thousand killed and hundred of thousand wounded a huge amount of machinery and equipment wa lost destroyed stolen they re on their last leg now they have nothing to offer they are waiting for a crushing blow to be dealt to them which will crush them this is crazy when the number

svo will be included in history textbook such information came from the ministry of education of the russian federation more than four dozen officer sergeant and soldier of the russian army and rosgvardia received the title of hero of russia after the start of the special operation and the brave act of each of them is worthy of generation of russian schoolchildren to know about it ukrainian

the country listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine on the eve of hero of the fatherland day komsomolskaya pravda journalist met with an officer whose plane wa shot down over enemy territory but he completed the combat mission and despite being wounded led the crew to his own short modest and in appearance a very young senior lieutenant try to be sociable and relaxed peter he extends his right hand and by the weak a if unnaturally constrained handshake we understand that the pilot ha not yet recovered to the end in september his su fighter bomber wa shot down over enemy territory while performing a combat mission in the special operation zone the situation is a stalemate he ha a broken arm the navigator ha a compression fracture of the spine around him enemy but by some miracle both manage to get out to their own and now in front of u sits a if descended from the page of boris polevoy s tale of a real man a russian officer pyotr kashtanov on the chest of the year old starley the star of the hero of russia play with glare you remember how that day began from the ascent a usual at a m i got up washed my face and had breakfast and i went to get the task also nothing supernatural a flight to destroy enemy equipment it s already routine take off work come back prepare take off work come back how many such flight per day can there be in different way the officer doe not disclose official information professionally we approached the plane with the navigator inspected checked the weapon sat down began to buckle up launch take off the pilot casually tell how at great speed they flew at ultra low altitude below meter this is so that you understand when power line jump so there is le chance that they will be shot down a they approached the target a column of enemy equipment how they worked on the enemy and began to move away from the target in the direction of their troop turned degree and here a powerful blow a in an accident here s a silly analogy almost peter reply diplomatically shook u and immediately the rotation along the axis began there wa very little time to make a decision a maximum of second thank goodness we had enough at what height wa the strike about meter you give the command to eject we are together the navigator said we ve been hit i immediately checked the control the plane is uncontrollable i just had time to say let s go out and put into operation the ejection system next thing the blow is strong it s all fleeting and i m already on a parachute for second we probably went down to the ground when i landed i realized that my right hand wasn t working left freed himself from the suspension system and began to look for a navigator he landed meter away those second when we were still in the air what were we thinking how do we get out now which way to go you crawled up to the navigator ran he s motionless i started to take off his helmet the hanging one he had already begun to recover and the first thing he said wa leave me here save yourself we can name the navigator dmitry koptilov what did you say to him i said nikolaich i will not leave without you let s get out together i didn t even think of leaving him there i just grabbed him by the unloading and dragged him away with one hand think so we should have at least given ourselves painkiller injection the first meter were overcome the navigator say unbearable pain i realized that i had to stab and you didn t have unbearable pain yes i somehow didn t feel it adrenaline we first overcame a little swamp that is we swam in the non commercial season only put on the anesthesia and we can already see the armed force of ukraine arrived on three or four car we decided that we would not surrender i took out a grenade and screwed a fuse into it the navigator also ha one arm the left my right is damaged he took a grenade in his left i said hold on nikolaich i m going to get the ring now and we started waiting the armed force of ukraine began to comb the area they were up to the platoon i guess you ve prepared to blow yourself up with one grenade how this decision wa made it wa quickly adopted but the decision wa difficult to surrender well i wouldn t allow myself to do that you can t give up in this life at all if we are detected there is time to live for second while the fuse burn you ve seen them search for you literally meter away we observed one he passed in one direction in the other and artillery strike began in this place i believe it wa our artillery that worked on them it saved our life because it scared them away they walked away we decided to wait until dark wet through for five hour they lie in the bush not moving waiting for dusk surprisingly men do not shake from the cold apparently the release of adrenaline and the effect of an anesthetic affect all this time somewhere nearby enemy reconnaissance is scurrying artillery explosion are heard sprinkling the wounded with earth and fragment on the flight in the late afternoon the cannonade subsides the navigator say i have a spine i can t get up peter reply nicholas we have to go it s going to be hard but it s going to go and they go unharvested field hiding in the thicket of sunflower and corn minute of walking minute of rest dmitry s injury constantly make itself felt remember a in polevoy and he decided to go to go east to go through the forest not trying to look for convenient road and living place to go no matter what it take it seemed that the weaker and more weak his body became the more stubborn and stronger his spirit wa in hour they overcame about kilometer we have come to a populated area come on stay here and i ll go see who s there in the village i tell the navigator and then they noticed a technique with the letter z everything nikolaich is one hundred percent ours they came to the first house noticed my grandfather father are there any russian troop here he said yes men i will take it away now i said can i have a drink he gave u water i wanted to drink all the way grandpa took you to someone to our gunner we went into one hangar the driver mechanic came out and he took u to the battalion at the headquarters they have already contacted ours and reported their whereabouts how the male gunner met you very well they also of course heard that such a situation had occurred and it is not known where the crew is and when we went out to them we were surprised of course but they accepted well immediately fed and then a helicopter flew after u who wa the first to be seen when he stepped out of the helicopter commander he reported on the completion of the task the commander hugged thank you guy for being alive well then there is the hospital treatment and awarding i wa happy with the award i wa confused rather i still don t realize what i did so heroically the country rated it that way i will carry this high title with dignity not only have you completed a combat mission and returned from it you pulled out your comrade in arm brought him home i didn t revert it we went together we acted a a coordinated mechanism a a crew that s the situation we did what we were taught okay so they did i remembered the teacher with a kind word of course my first instructor pilot had already been called i am grateful to all the instructor who put young boy on the wing in the training regiment this is worth a lot they have a very large and responsible job but pyotr kashtanov became a pilot only because of his perseverance he wa drawn to the sky from a young age my mother said that they lived near the airfield and four year old peter loved to watch how every day plane took off above him and the dome of parachute opened in the air that s when he said that he would definitely become a pilot although he himself doe not remember it after the th grade he entered a boarding school in tambov with initial flight training everything is like in the army a company a platoon a barrack position outfit and when i graduated i went to flight school only enrolled a much a the fifth time one discipline wa not given during this time he even served a term a a tanker but he did not give up the dream of heaven if i take on something i will bring it to the end first flight delight and admiration this cannot be conveyed because in principle it is not characteristic of a person to fly and that s for life and who wa your reference point maresyev of course this is the well known story of a man who crawled because his leg were broken to his own and he also had a dream to fly and he achieved this he flew without leg and you plan to return to the sky of course now treatment and recovery and then at the helm of the aircraft the best in the world su now the young boy will read they will also want to become pilot what quality you need to cultivate in yourself persistence is unequivocal patience is everything ha it time a they say the main thing in aviation is to always be honest in front of me

the special military operation ha prepared a springboard for the offensive and defense said military expert head of the bureau of military political analysis alexander mikhailov our soldier are much better prepared for combat operation in sub zero temperature than the enemy there are a number of reason that can become a turning point and change the course of the special operation this winter the first of them is russian strike on ukrainian energy facility in addition there are great risk of reduced support for the west and the flight of foreign mercenary who take part in the battle extensively attack on infrastructure de energize railway communication route mikhailov said on the morning program what will happen on radio komsomolskaya pravda the very logistics of the delivery of ammunition new weapon personnel the removal of wounded fighter from the battle line the shipment of broken damaged equipment or in need of repair now western equipment is mainly repaired in poland and eastern europe in general that logistics is broken and therefore for the winter period when additional food hydrocarbon fuel power generator and so on are so necessary everything that allows the group to function normally in the winter the delivery of all this to the contact line is associated with great logistical problem and how serious is the counteroffensive of the russian armed force in what direction is the advance of our troop likely the host asked the contact line is now very long almost kilometer starting from the kherson region and up to the border of the kharkiv region clash do not stop the entire contact line is active true weather condition lead to some stiffness both side switch to the winter period there is a re uniform of fighter and the arrival of military equipment which is prepared for the winter period equipped with appropriate liquid and fuel and lubricant this is the supply of related equipment to the troop which allows you to create more comfortable living condition in this respect russian troop are much better prepared we have formed a long and deeply layered line of defense it run along the left bank of the dnieper and further along the contact line up to the kharkiv region on our part additional force of personnel are concentrated the mobilized russian are taking control of the settlement of the new region of russia ensuring law and order there plus the material and technical base accumulated for the upcoming winter period in this regard on the ukrainian side everything is much sadder and we see that all the attempt of the armed force of ukraine over the past few week to make at least a little progress have failed after the regrouping of russian troop from kherson to the left bank no more settlement came under the control of ukraine on the contrary a number of settlement came under the control of russia first of all these are settlement in the dpr the advance towards artemovsk and the liberation of small settlement in the agglomeration and the further prospect of access to slavyansk and kramatorsk this lead to the achievement of the main result the complete liberation of the territory of donbas let s hope that these goal will be achieved in the coming week right in the coming week you think i mean the liberation of the dpr week are a stretchy concept but it seems to me that in the winter that is in december january and february there will be a turning point in the course of hostility because the russian army is better prepared for the winter both materially and technically russian equipment fight at low temperature unlike western which is not always tested in these condition and latitude and the mercenary unit on which this collective support of the ukrainian army is based i strongly doubt that they are ready to conduct combat operation in real sub zero temperature and in the absence of proper logistics support it seems to me that after the new year they will flee from ukraine en masse i think that winter will put everything in it place general moroz is traditionally on the russian side the situation on the front could lead to political proposal from the kiev regime which ha problem with both energy and western partner which are le and le willing to supply the regime with weapon it seems to me that the format and scale of assistance to ukraine will soon be revised in the direction of a significant reduction and this will be said either before the new year or immediately after through the mouth of european politician among the ukrainian elite this will certainly cause disappointment but it must be said that even the american elite who are directly in charge of the conflict are clearly tired of the ukrainian agenda listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine childhood go away quickly so nothing should prevent you from enjoying the happiest time of life this opinion is shared by the participant of the humanitarian mission of the united russia party therefore after school hour they organized sport class for kherson child according to the head of the humanitarian mission of the party state duma deputy igor kastyukevich the event are held in temporary accommodation center in the genichesk district everything necessary for class is available there we provided sport equipment for child when we were here last time now schoolchildren have their own sport coach who not only organize various kind of activity but also make up a complex of simple and understandable movement for everyone so that child can practice independently said igor kastyukevich the child will demonstrate the acquired skill to the mentor the next time they arrive it is worth noting that the guy already have a good sport training someone owns the technique of boxing the girl were engaged in dancing gymnastics and choreography the most active young athlete were entitled to sweet and not only prize from united russia volunteer sport will now take a full place in the life of every schoolchild in temporary accommodation center taking into account the wish of the guy themselves the coach organized team relay the schoolchildren called one of their team russia bridge in the kalmius district of mariupol were destroyed by ukrainian troop during the retreat and now russian builder are actively working to restore them the opening of traffic on bridge will not only help resident shorten the path but will also allow faster delivery to the liberated territory of material and equipment necessary for the construction of house school and hospital said dpr prime minister vitaly khotsenko he personally together with the team inspected the construction site and noted that there wa enough equipment and people one bridge will be commissioned at the end of february the other in march the city is being transformed before our eye say larisa demina from mariupol school bridge house are being restored debris is being dismantled people are returning to the city it is visible in transport shop everywhere more mariupol resident a low bow to the builder vitaly khotsenko also visited novoazovsk located near mariupol repair work is also in full swing there with the head of the administration of the novoazovsky district oleg morgun we inspected a number of social facility that are being restored with the help of the moscow region a lot ha been done in the last few month these are social facility mcds road bridge such a pace of recovery ha not been here for decade the prime minister said he added that issue of economic development of the territory were also discussed it is also necessary to create condition for business and new job that is a priority the territory ha a fairly good tourist potential i am sure that novoazovsk ha every chance to become a center of attraction for tourist khotsenko added sviatohirsk ukraine when myroslava a year old construction manager returned to her hometown of sviatohirsk in eastern ukraine last month she expected to find her house destroyed by shelling her house wa indeed heavily damaged but she discovered something else even more disturbing her neighbor who had stayed behind during the russian occupation had stolen furniture insulation and roof tile from her home and a property she oversaw in town these were people she had grown up with she lamented worse the looted tile were visible on the neighbor s roof friend are not friend anymore she said on a cold november day her brown hair tucked in a beanie and her small frame wrapped in a winter coat the neighbor are not neighbor relative a part of them aren t relative anymore because no one expected u to come back similar anxiety have been playing out among resident of the town still mostly empty of people ever since ukrainian force liberated it in september the russian arrival over the summer imposed a litmus test of sort for sviatohirsk and other tight knit community in ukraine s east where the russian church and russian television had for year been promoting loyalty to moscow a civilian who fled sviatohirsk rejoin neighbor who stayed resident say they now eye one another with suspicion and a a cold winter set in the town remains divided not by trench line and artillery but by where people s allegiance lie with moscow or kyiv suspicion run so high that resident do not even agree which side russia or ukraine is responsible for shelling that struck various neighborhood in the city damaging house and killing several dozen people no one is even letting it out who he stand for and all that said one resident an older man who declined to provide his name he wa sitting beside a warm steel stove at a makeshift coffee shop called bouch e that serf a de facto neutral territory a place where both pro ukrainian and pro russian can get a bite to eat undisturbed a long a they keep to themselves the town s freshly installed local government recognizes the problem and hope that resident with pro russian sentiment will eventually embrace kyiv especially a condition improve after living without power and basic service during the occupation the cellphone connection is working the bread factory is working the ukrainian post office is working said volodymyr rybalkin the head of the local military administration who act a a sort of interim mayor i think that even the people who knowingly stayed under occupation waiting for the so called russian world will sooner or later understand how much they were mistaken but that conversion will not be easy even before the war the presence of the monastery of the cave loyal to the russian orthodox church and considered one of the church s five holiest site gave the town a reputation for being pro russian that perception wa compounded by sviatohirsk s location in the donbas a predominantly russian speaking region where moscow for decade promoted soviet nostalgia politics the propaganda especially on television ha helped the kremlin influence some russian speaking civilian in the east even a it falsely depicts the region a essentially part of russia and cite the supposed oppression of russian speaker there a a justification for invading how sviatohirsk will move on from it troubled interlude of occupation remains unclear around people remain from a prewar population of about according to local official approximately resident have returned since the russian retreat returnees like myroslava believe that more people with pro ukrainian sensibility will come back when the weather warms in the spring diluting the local sentiment toward russia they are already slowly starting to come back because a lot of them can t pay rent in other city and they return even if their house is destroyed said myroslava who returned to her home in october she declined to provide her last name for security reason the monastery where nun and monk remained loyal to the russian church wields significant influence in the town adding an extra layer of complexity yeah people are coming back to sviatohirsk but no quality people will be left here the holy father say so said an older man deploring the return of the pro ukrainian and suggesting they did not share the pro russian view of the church the man standing in the town s cemetery declined to give his name he wa helping to rebury a child killed in the shelling whose body had recently been exhumed so that the local police could examine it in recent week kyiv s intelligence service have launched at least one operation and a series of arrest aimed at rooting out spy in the church drawing condemnation from moscow and president volodymyr zelensky recently proposed outlawing the branch of the ukrainian orthodox church that is loyal to moscow saying the measure wa needed to ensure russia is not able to weaken ukraine from within western ukraine is thinking in it own way and donbas is thinking in a different way said one of the monastery s monk who also declined to provide his name he compared those from the west to occupier the older man sitting at the bouch e cafe had done the same comparing ukraine s liberation of the town to another occupation local official are still trying to determine if some resident actively collaborated with the russian ruslan tsymbal a senior district police officer in sviatohirsk declined to discus the issue of russian collaborator but confirmed there were ongoing investigation in the case of myroslava s looted belonging the police and the military were able to get back some of her stolen furniture another problem exacerbating tension is the feeling among some resident that other member of the community might have turned on them ihor ponomarenko who owned an adventure park and served in the town s territorial defense said his name and personal information were posted on pro russian chat on telegram a messaging service toward the end of march the same thing happened to others connected to the territorial defense he said a well a local volunteer and the town s military administration they created website claiming that we are fascist and so on mr ponomarenko said he returned to sviatohirsk in october his park and cafe where he would host child s birthday party were destroyed decoration he had put up for valentine s day lay scattered in ruin other local business owner who were pro ukrainian also lost their livelihood when the russian came he said some business like his were destroyed by shelling others were looted by their pro russian neighbor he said though he did not cite any evidence resident who rode out much of the occupation from their basement shelter are still surveying part of their destroyed town and there are sharply different view among some on which army is to blame for the carnage more than people died during the occupation according to local official many from shelling initially there were a lot of people trying to prove that this is ukraine who ruined our building said mr rybalkin the military administrator even though they didn t understand that the enemy wa held off here when the ukrainian kept the russian from fording the river but neighbor still argued about how the battle for sviatohirsk which lasted from june when the russian occupied the town until they retreated in september unfolded the fighting played out in phase on either side of the siversky donets river which bisects the town a bridge that connected both side where lover once placed lock on it railing wa destroyed a kyiv s force retreated in the summer russian force on the north side of the river fired into the hill on the south occasionally striking the monastery ground ukrainian force entrenched on the high bank fired back across the river to the town the monk at the monastery accused the ukrainian of shelling the holy site killing several people though it wa clear at least on the damage visible from the exterior that the shell had come from the russian side of the river myroslava shrugged off claim by resident who blame the ukrainian for the town s destruction they like to say that ukraine wa firing from the mountain but they would not have fired if seven russian tank were not stationed next to my yard she said the rusted hulk of some of those tank are still in her neighborhood carved open by ukrainian shell much like the home around them their roof panel clattering in the cold wind she repeated they would not have fired russia s wagner group a private military mercenary force ha seen each of it fighter reportedly burn an average of round of ammunition per day in an attempt to fight off a fierce ukrainian counteroffensive wagner group fighter attempting to hold onto gain in ukraine s donbas region have faced an onslaught of attack by ukrainian force looking to take back lost ground and heavy fighting is depleting ammunition at an alarming rate according to an institute for the study of war analysis released wednesday the u s based think tank s report detailed the fighting around the city of bakhmut with ukrainian force attempting to retake position south of the city and russian force mounting an attack on the city itself that wa repelled by ukraine heavy fighting ha also been reported near kherson oblast where ukrainian force have consistently attacked russian position around the city the heavy fighting ha taken a toll on both side though the fierce ukrainian resistance ha worked to stall russian president vladimir putin s war aim and prompted him to acknowledge the conflict may be drawn out for some time russian force will also now be forced to combat ukraine s winter climate another possible roadblock amid report earlier this week that the country s military lack sufficient clothing and gear to combat the element

and not only in the army it wa necessary for the full restoration of the limb of seriously wounded fighter the russian defense ministry clarified the new technology allows for example to form an individual three dimensional implant for each wounded person it corresponds one to one in size and shape to the lost fragment of the patient s bone according to specialist of the burdenko hospital a similar d implant is installed in the area of the destroyed limb of the wounded after that it is filled with fragment of bone tissue of the patient these tissue are taken from other bone of the victim they are transplanted or grown using the patient s own stem cell according to military doctor this d technology also help to quickly and reliably restore the joint muscle and skin of a person injured in a mine explosion or received multiple shrapnel wound including in the limb area previously such damage wa considered in most case almost irreversible because of what the arm or leg had to be amputated the technological veil of secrecy in this breakthrough area wa slightly opened by the deputy head of the burdenko military hospital for research chief traumatologist leonid brizhan today

languished under the kiev regime for several decade the imposed deliberate ukrainization which for so many year extinguished and suppressed the true root of the kherson region could not kill the bright and warm light inside the inhabitant and after the referendum their love for their native land and tradition increased and multiplied one of the indicator that life ha finally acquired a new meaning and improved wa high quality free medicine previously it wa necessary to spend fabulous money on treatment so many kherson resident simply avoided the health care system that wa terrible we

a a deoxidizer of steel and for it alloying it give iron based alloy strength wear resistance and impact resistance the plant said that the furnace did not work for two year the reason for this wa the ukrainian shelling the result of which the equipment wa disabled there were regular interruption in power supply all this hampered the normal functioning of the plant now these difficulty are in the past noted at the enterprise after carrying out repair preparatory and commissioning work the furnace ha passed the necessary technological period of heating and is currently reaching the operating parameter furnace number four at the plant decided to transfer to the production of high silicon ferrosilicon of the f brand this is a metal alloy the basis of which is silicon it content can range from to now our production volume is ton of ferrosilicon per day and ton of ferrosilicomanganese said vitaly podorvanov head of the smelting shop we stood for a very long time because of the shelling of the armed force of ukraine there were hit in production building damage to line and we could not start normal work podorvanov stressed that the resumption of the functioning of the enterprise

export play an important role in maintaining the level of capacity utilization in the near future we expect a significant increase in consumption in the new region of the russian federation here one of our goal is to increase shipment to the region adjacent to the plant next year the southern mining and metallurgical complex plan to maximize the use of industrial capacity of enterprise to restore new region of the russian federation and increase supply to the russian market and under favorable condition they expect to increase steel production to three million ton meanwhile donbas enterprise after the entry of the republic into russia felt support for them the path of revival began for example the lugastal plant plan to double the production rate up to one thousand ton of product per month the market is opening up for u say the head of the workshop of the enterprise vladimir gorbulich i think there will be new customer perhaps we will master something new there will be proposal we will work lugastal is engaged in steel casting for railway transport general engineering and metallurgy the plant is equipped with a set of necessary equipment for the production of cast steel billet when mobilization began in the lpr many employee of the enterprise went to the front there were not enough people but the plant did not stop working now the situation is stabilizing men are returning to work one of these is the senior master of rod forming and earth preparation sergey ivanin after the entry of the lpr into russia our plant will successfully enter the russian market and will actively expand the range of product the man who returned from the front is sure serviceman and civilian of donbas regained their sight thanks to the head physician of the yakutsk republican ophthalmological clinical hospital the winner of the contest leader of russia ivan lutskan and his team lutskan and his colleague were on a business trip to kirovsky doctor learned that patient there were treated using outdated technology in addition there wa an acute shortage of narrowly focused specialist every day doctor worked hour a day receiving patient and training colleague from donbas kp spoke to the hero in a white coat ivan petrovich how did you decide to go from yakutia to the dpr when i went through the crucible of the contest leader of russia and won there i understood what task the state face what contribution is required from me to the development of the country the choice of whether to go or not in front of me did not even stand and i wa pleased to see my colleague around me who volunteered to go to the dpr with me this is the most important thing to see such a conscious responsible decision from the team you stayed in kirov for almost three week they were probably like one long marathon we tried to work from early morning until pm people lined up at one o clock in the morning for coupon we received everyone even on a first come first served basis we have established a good reception of patient people from other city immediately pulled up to u word of mouth instantly worked they came from donetsk novoazovsk yenakiieve snizhne in total we received more than thousand patient what specialist were lacking in the local hospital a neurologist ophthalmologist cardiologist ultrasound specialist x ray laboratory assistant were required we took all of them with u on the trip and they also described mammograph image remotely study were conducted for woman there were more than ultrasound examination the neurologist before u wa only one in the whole city rushing from hospital to clinic and of course there wa an urgent need for ophthalmologist especially ophthalmic surgeon so the patient went through a full cycle from the initial diagnosis of vision problem to the operation and discharge prior to our arrival operation there were paid thousand ruble per eye pensioner could not pull such an amount what problem did people address you with a lot of patient with cataract people had a cloudy lens they could not see well on average these are patient aged to year a lot of neglected case for people to regain their sight wa a great miracle i have never heard such word of gratitude anywhere they came with apple pear from their garden we cried with joy we performed operation and behind each is a touching story there were also young guy who suffered an eye injury at the front including those with shrapnel many worker from the mine who had piece of coal in their eye what case do you remember they brought my year old grandmother for the past five year she ha seen nothing and walked by touch and after the operation she walked herself for the first time in a long time she came to u and cried lord i am so grateful to you i see you now at least i can walk around the apartment go down to the store and walk a little i also remember a year old girl from donetsk with a small child she ha been visually impaired since childhood congenital cataract the crystal is removed only one eye see with a lens of minus it s a tough case but we weighed the pro and con and performed the surgery and now she can see the world without glass and lens calmly raise a child kstat ivan lutskan promise that yakut doctor will return to the dpr now plan are being formed for the trip of doctor in there are already request for our work on surgery and various consultation in mariupol we believe it is our duty to come there and of course we will not forget our sponsored city of kirovskoye and yakutia itself will help the city in all sphere we will not leave anyone in trouble in ukraine they will not wait for russia to run out of missile after each massive blow to the infrastructure they consider how much smaller our arsenal ha become but in russia the defense industry is constantly replenishing warehouse but in ukraine there is a significant shortage of ammunition and this is due not only to the difficulty of delivering good to the front due to problem with power grid but also to a decrease in nato supply and first of all from the united state many people talk about this this is a general observation said ilya kramnik a researcher at the institute of world economy and international relation of the russian academy of science speaking with ivan pankin and igor vittel the volume of supply ha fallen markedly and the artillery of the armed force of ukraine ha fewer opportunity than it wa in the summer unfortunately these opportunity are enough to terrorize peaceful residential area but for full fledged front line operation no longer the offensive capability of the ukrainian troop have sharply decreased according to kramnik the overwhelming majority of the supply of ammunition to the armed force of ukraine fall on nato country more than percent of these nato supply the vast majority are from the united state he say the rest deliver a lot le and it wa the reduction in american supply this fall that became the most significant reason for the reduction of the arsenal of the armed force of ukraine and what can be said about the ukrainian defense industry a huge part of the ukrainian industry accounted for the republic of donbas which now ukraine doe not have and obviously will never have the expert said and everything else that wa produced in ukraine what still survived in kharkiv in sumy is far from the scale to talk about an independent military industrial complex there are some fragment of the military industrial complex that can perform simple operation but this is mainly due to the repair of equipment but not to production not even with the production of ammunition what doe the statement of the head of the pentagon lloyd austin mean that washington is not going to prevent kiev from developing weapon for long range strike the state have repeatedly said that they want to supply ukraine with long range ammunition which is designed to attack our territory but ukraine itself can theoretically produce fairly simple simple device for which they will be supplied with component let them not receive finished product from the west but they will be sent for example a designer a control system wing a body a tail they will put their accelerator there and can launch and if this come to u then formally the west ha nothing to do with it and they can work according to this scheme can even in the condition of a dilapidated military industrial complex that s what they do in palestine that s what they do in yemen that s what many more people do do they have their own scientific groundwork the school remained done of course kharkov remained kiev remained mykolaiv remained but these are rather the dying remnant of a large industrial complex these development made sense when the ussr wa alive these development were part of a huge military industrial complex and now everything is just dying out because the main customer ha always been moscow the soviet ministry of defense then the russian ministry of defense they supported ukraine for a long time with their order they will not be able to do anything even if the production is taken somewhere in poland depends on what you mean to develop guided weapon themselves drone i think yes they will be able to still they have enough engineering personnel to develop such thing plus they have a fairly developed production of aircraft engine in zaporozhye of course in what condition it is now after the plant is periodically calibrated is a question but there were engine including for cruise missile if you combine such a case with the body and insert the simplest western navigation satellite system into it then it can be used simply a a kamikaze drone it will fly to western coordinate listen a well ukraine will pay for nuclear terrorism the investigative committee of russia received testimony from russian serviceman that they were returned from captivity they described in detail how they were tortured by ukrainian nationalist a it turned out our soldier were tortured not only immediately after capture to find out the call sign number and location of military unit but also after a few week and even

relative representative of ukrainian armed formation demanded that russian prisoner of war sign a voluntary consent to cooperate with ukrainian special service the testimony of russian serviceman

petrenko an official representative of the investigative committee of russia now the investigative committee of russia together with the operational service of the ministry of internal affair and the fsb of russia the ministry of defense of the russian federation continues to identify ukrainian nationalist involved in the torture and murder of civilian a well a russian serviceman who have been

of the resident of donbas who in stood up to defend their land and continue to fight for it now denis miroshnichenko chairman of the people s council of the republic secretary of the luhansk regional branch of the united russia party told komsomolka we will remember the feat of soldier who participate in the special military operation of the russian federation and protect u from neo nazism the hero of the fatherland should be remembered not only on this memorable day but also daily this is the patriotic education of the younger generation said denis miroshnichenko since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on december russian force destroyed more than himars missile at a metallurgical plant in kryvyi rih another shell for the himars mlrs were destroyed in the dpr russian troop struck the point of deployment of foreign mercenary in the borovsky kharkiv region on the eve of the deployment of mercenary wa destroyed in another settlement in the region the lpr said that the ukrainian army daily loses about a battalion of personnel in the artemovsk direction according to the officer of the people s militia of the lpr andrei marochko the armed force of ukraine suffer serious loss due to their attempt to make a breakthrough in the area of svatov and kremennaya russian soldier who returned from ukrainian captivity spoke about torture during interrogation in particular their finger were cut off and electrocuted russian troop killed serviceman of the armed force of ukraine in the krasnolimansky direction more than ukrainian soldier were killed in other area the sbu conduct inspection at the facility of the ukrainian orthodox church in cherkasy and volyn region also the sbu conduct inspection in the assumption cathedral in kherson russian president vladimir putin admired the serviceman participating in the special operation putin said that russian soldier in the svo zone are fighting brilliantly there wa no firm belief that i would be able to speak at the presidential human right council but just in case he prepared a fish in which he outlined the main pain point of the special military operation that bother no not the military purely military topic seemed inappropriate to me for the hrc they are quite frankly discussed in a different non public format i made the top three complaint from the relative of our fighter who write to me in telegram and that s dozen of message every day the composition of the hrc is impressive but the president s schedule is limited and only half of the council wa able to speak which however raised really important topic what i wanted to say link to the front so percent of people who contact me start with the word help me find a husband son brother a a rule we are talking about the mobilized these are people who have already gone through all the instance but could not find out where their relative is and what is wrong with him it doe not appear on bad list the ministry of defense reply but the mother s heart cannot be soothed by this and woman are looking for support among journalist who have even fewer opportunity to find out the whereabouts of the mobilized at the same time the problem is solved elementarily there are example of high quality work of the command of the unit with relative when both letter and parcel can be transmitted through the point of permanent deployment they are taken to the front by their own transport and handed over to the fighter personally in their hand but this unfortunately is not a systematic approach at the same time year ago at any end of the country a person could put his letter in a box and be sure that it would reach the front and there will be an answer before the war our country wa called the most reading in the world during the war she became the most written during the four year of the great patriotic war postman delivered billion triangle postcard secret to recipient our field mail address wa announced only for the tenth month of the conflict it remains to be hoped that it will work without failure payment in second place is the issue of non payment there are case when volunteer do not receive any money for four month here s an example so that this problem doesn t look like a dry protocol string i am the wife of the mobilized oleg chertov the husband wa drafted on september and on october he wa already in the lpr for two month he did not receive a penny at all i turned and wrote wherever i could there is still no answer from anywhere we have a large family of two adult and four schoolchildren one of the child is disabled wait how wa he even drafted with so many child you tried to challenge the mobilization my husband love his homeland and did not hide behind the child the woman simply reply to me understand she doe not ask her husband to return home because he can return to the family by law she only need something to support the child while the father defends the fatherland to be fair there are no mass complaint about non payment but such appeal come regularly including from civilian i wa in kherson when the evacuation wa announced from this city and unfortunately there were case when people left for big russia but a week later they returned unable to withstand the press of the bureaucracy soulless formalism can finish anyone off what can we say about people with a shattered psyche who are traveling from hostility but stumble upon bureaucratic arbitrariness we were given a certificate for housing neither my husband nor i received the promised they also did not receive social assistance writes the ivanov couple who received russian citizenship in kherson and voted in a referendum for a new life we are both pensioner pension were also not given to u either for october or november in kherson we were given a pension of until september equipment and caring the third is equipment in some place it is still lacking especially in winter and some relative complain that you even have to take a loan to buy your husband a high quality warm uniform it lack is not always the head scratching of the rearguard although it is present it s just that many unit live in harsh field condition where camouflage wear out very quickly and according to the charter a set of summer and winter uniform per year is required so don t ask for more and the fighter have to turn to volunteer then to journalist then to relative at the same time i noticed a pattern a long time ago if in the unit the commander is initiative and not indifferent then everything is in order with his equipment and with communication with relative and with product in position there are excellent example of interaction between the military and regional authority and there is complete indifference that s where the problem come in which however are already an order of magnitude le than at the initial stage of mobilization everything will be brought to fruition unfortunately my turn did not reach me however all these problem with specific specific example from the hrc will be brought to the attention of the president or solved manually through the relevant department in the end it is possible to determine the suitability for service of a person with an introvertebral schmorl hernia that requires surgical intervention the document are in my hand without the participation of the president if you approach the soldier in a human way and not formally listen a well karen shakhnazarov for both the west and russia the defeat in ukraine threatens with very serious consequence more how do mobilized men live in the trench what are they asking for will kalibr run out when to expect a turning point in russia s military operation and what we lack for victory the main issue of recent month in the studio of radio kp with the presenter ivan pankin were discussed by the legendary military officer komsomolka alexander kots who returned from another business trip honest answer of a person who ha been to all the hot spot on the contact line are in our material that rare case when you can catch you in the editorial office after february for a long time to moscow before the new year for sure a lot of household chore have accumulated worker recently i am a member of the human right council under the president this also imposes duty it is necessary to delve into this work which in principle i am familiar with because for nine month i had to face the problem of people in uniform and a far a possible some even decide what are the main problem you face the first is the equipment and not always this problem is due to the thuggery of the command people were normally equipped for example they were brought to the forest they live in the forest and there are harsh condition and the uniform wear out quickly kamaz come under fire with supply burn everything that wa in it or they gave something away initially but it got lost in the fight sometimes the negligence of the rear guard there are complaint and question about the promised money especially among volunteer there are a lot of appeal from relative who are looking for their son and husband here he wa not in touch for a month and his relative are already panicking i understand that in the zone of a special operation the military may not get in touch for month there are place from where it is simply impossible to call but the mother or wife cannot be reassured by this moreover until recently we did not have field mail a a class in the great patriotic war postman delivered almost billion letter from home to the front and back after year for some reason this ha become a problem the ministry of defense ha published an address to which you can send letter and parcel we ll see how it work do you have a feeling that the situation one way or another is changing for the better or not negative example are the loudest and there are fewer of them than positive one over the past two and a half month i have met with those mobilized in the kherson direction in zaporozhye on the svatovsky frontier i wa not taken to special exemplary place i chose and drove to the front i met the salt of the russian land our usual men former locksmith builder it specialist i came across alone and in principle they of course are not so directly tactically dressed and equipped but normally provided with uniform live in difficult but tolerable condition no one on the front will create condition for you you create them for yourself you once wrote do not pay attention to the difficulty you are facing it is difficult not to pay attention a man come from a civilian and then he shovel in his teeth and knee deep in water swarm a trench for himself and make drainage ditch and i just looked at these guy a lump came to my throat with pride people only from civilian life are pulled out thrown into this inferno and they do not lose their spirit sense of humor they display marvel of bravery courage and precision two guy mobilized from the tambov region were especially sunk into my soul for three week they were trained a a calculation of the malka gun of millimeter and they are now on the front line on the matchmaking frontier every day they destroy the enemy s equipment clearly accurately according to the coordinate that intelligence give them their commander call them jeweler these are guy who once upon a time served military service completely unrelated to artillery this suggests that at the training ground they had high quality training a normal commander and he taught them to shoot from this huge caterpillar colossus yes they live in the forest in camping condition but they are provided with rubber boot raincoat thermal underwear that s what the commander knocked out for them they fight with desire what an atmosphere on the front line people want to go forward they say we re tired of sitting in the trench i talked to the guy in the kherson direction even before we left there and they say well what mood can there be people in russia expect some victory and feat from u but we have been standing in the forest for several month we want to advance at the same time there is an understanding that before the start of mobilization there wa actually nothing to go to because in the spring and summer we advanced for a long time lost people equipment and there wa nowhere to make up for it now the industry is working and in many area the situation ha been stabilized at the same svatov frontier the mobilized played their part they hold their ground they shoot from malok and tulip ride tank and this ha not yet come the bulk of the conscript from the reserve which is undergoing in depth training there is a slow but still progress in the direction of artemovsk bakhmut this is a very important story because there ukraine spends most of it artillery reserve there kiev is now suffering the greatest loss in manpower and it is for the donbas front that the battle for bakhmut may turn out to be a turning point the task is not just to take the city but also to destroy a much manpower and equipment of the enemy a possible since he allows you to do this doe not take into account any loss the nature of the hostility is such that ukraine suffers loss many time greater than ours but let s not be disingenuous they re on a roll right now they are trying to transfer reserve from the kherson direction to svatovo and zaporozhye that is they threaten u with breakthrough both there and there ukrainian artillery fire more per day than the american in afghanistan in a month this cannot go on forever sooner or later the ukrainian troop should begin to decline because of loss because of the lack of ammunition let s start from the word of the same adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine arestovich who say that the russian are running out of shell and missile he s pressing on what the russian are still bombing u with the soviet legacy what do you say to that are we fighting with the soviet legacy including what s wrong with that thank you for having it and they re fighting that s good or bad that s a given it s too bad we don t have system like france s caesar yet it is bad that we do not yet have analogue of the american hymars there is no low orbit satellite constellation but i know that there are development i will not say from which soviet heritage which in their characteristic will surpass the khaymars and we have the ability to do a lot of them these system are already being tested in combat condition but have not yet been supplied en masse you will go to the front after the new year you have what expectation high expectation usually make you frustrated therefore i am just going to continue to work to talk about people who fight treat wound help with humanitarian aid for me a special operation is first and foremost about fate this year i wa on a business trip for month out of i talked about dozen of character both in uniform and without adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine podolyak said that in six month they will take the crimea what do you say we should be afraid of this there is no need to be afraid we must understand that they keep it in mind and in all seriousness it s not a crazy statement by a city madman they really have it in their plan and i will tell you that if we had not launched a special operation they would have started a war against donbas and crushed it i m sure of it personally just crushed by quantity and on the courage they would go further to the crimea and heavy fighting would ensue and what is happening now in the territory of ukraine and new russian region would happen in crimea if now in the winter campaign they succeed in an offensive operation for example in the zaporozhye direction they can cut our group and reach the border with crimea therefore it is no coincidence that powerful defensive line are being built there now this mean that we calculate all scenario the winter campaign is still more of a revival of hostility or conversely it will be such a trench confrontation it s a change in the nature of the fighting if there is a warm winter then there is no need to wait for any great activity using heavy equipment at the same time if we recall the campaign of the beginning of this year yes in february there were still frost when we came to kiev the equipment calmly went to the kharkiv direction january donetsk airport wa taken despite any weather condition debaltseve wa taken and how did they fight in the great patriotic war they didn t pause for the winter the main thing is that the industry should reach the turn when it will be able to supply some equipment to the troop online every day it ha already been stated that our military industrial complex work in three shift yes yes i know we are doing very well on kalibr we are making up for iskanders very well but we also need modern tank gun barrel because the wear is terrible here in lugansk i have a friend the commander of the cannon division they were given the fourth gun to the hyacinth in these month ok a for the equipment there were complaint in the beginning how do you as it now like the barrel the equipment is also very seriously worn out in the field i repeat where the commander is initiative where he treat the personnel normally where he understands that the fulfillment of the combat mission will depend on how his fighter will be equipped everything is normal there if it is not possible to knock something out of the rear he look for way out to volunteer to sponsor there are example of excellent interaction between business and the army regional authority and the army i m not going to name anyone right now so that i m not accused of bias but there are great example instead of the final who doe time work for last question who doe time work for if hostility continue in one way or another in a global sense now time is playing on u ukraine ha an inexhaustible mobilization resource we called for thousand and they will call conditionally a million but by this time i hope our will have been qualitatively trained and equipped armed and provided with equipment and the enemy will still have problem with equipment and ammunition in the near future one way or another with a cavalry charge we will not drive the enemy to the western border but some kind of turning point i think still in the winter campaign in our direction should happen maybe in the next month a patient in serious condition wa admitted to u from the zone of a special military operation with a diagnosis an explosive injury acute bleeding detachment of the upper and lower jaw with a laryngeal defect list the actually fatal diagnosis of the senior resident of the department of maxillofacial surgery of the naval clinical hospital of the ministry of defense of russia captain of the medical service stanislav latukha military doctor in the crimea were able not only to save the life of the soldier after a massive mine explosive wound to the head but also immediately performed the whole complex of urgent measure in order to return some of his vital function in the future to restore the function of speech swallowing and breathing prosthetics of the larynx plastic surgery of the nose mouth hard and soft palate were performed the tongue wa modeled so that after healing sensitivity returned to it but what to do next when the fighter ha lost a significant part of the bone of the skull and both jaw from the crimea the soldier wa taken to moscow to the maxillofacial surgeon and dentist of the main military clinical hospital named after n n burdenko who will make him several more reconstructive operation a a result of the wound the patient formed a defect in both jaw lip the bottom of the oral cavity the right cheek and the submandibular region on the right a fracture of the right cheekbone complex with

that will hold smaller reconstructed by doctor bone to create a new jaw it wa planned to use a graft from the fibula the three dimensional model of which wa moved into the defect of the lower jaw and

after the full restoration of health the serviceman if he wish will even be able to continue military service the russian defense ministry said listen a well will volgograd be renamed stalingrad since the investigative committee of the russian federation ha opened criminal case against ukrainian serviceman and other representative of armed nationalist formation that committed crime against the civilian population of donbas and ukraine among the defendant are the military and political leadership nationalist and representative of the ukrainian security force among the crime are genocide terrorism cruel treatment of the civilian population the use of prohibited mean and method in the armed conflict murder intentional destruction and damage to property article of the criminal code of the russian federation and others the official representative of the investigative committee of russia svetlana petrenko listed she also noted that among the defendant are more than person in particular representative of the high command of the armed force of ukraine a well a commander of military unit who gave criminal order to shell civilian and civilian infrastructure in total the investigation of criminal case ha been completed work to record the action of the kiev regime and it supporter continues the investigative committee of russia establishes and give a legal assessment of the action of all person involved in the crime committed the investigative committee of russia emphasized for me the year in culture can be divided into two era before feb after feb before i felt pretty certain nothing would command my attention like jacques louis david radical draftsman the metropolitan museum of art s icy cerebral unrelentingly rigorous exhibition of drawing from the year around the french revolution no one had ever staged a full scale show of david s work on paper and this one offered an unusual vista of an artist whose grand painting put reason before passion and ideal before blood relation in four drawing for his death of socrates finished in we saw the philosopher prepare to drink the lethal cocktail rather than repudiate his belief eight sketch for his brutus leading right up to showed the roman consul refusing to mourn his traitorous son a their corp are hauled away my feeling for this greatest of neoclassical artist who spun roman precedent into propaganda for the reign of terror and then for napoleon have cycled over many year between adulation and queasiness in front of these drawing at the met i fell in love with david again with his intensity and his frigidity with how in his shadow today s political art look a benign a patty cake here were the slow accretive process of someone ready to die or indeed to kill for a vision of civic virtue and then a week after the met show opened feb i couldn t turn off the livestreams of the kyiv night sky lit up with white flash deranged by baying siren and crackling shell i watched from the secure distance of my phone a refugee streamed westward and those who stayed went underground later i went in person to see what had been destroyed and who wa fighting back why doe culture matter to a person to a nation in paris in kyiv in in because in time of great upheaval you need exemplar to look toward because when you might lose everything you must sum up what should never be forgotten an invasion is not a revolution the young artist caught up in europe s largest conflagration since world war ii are working amid a campaign of terror david by would become a terroriste himself nevertheless when culture took on the dimension of survival ukraine s artist have done what i thought could no longer be done they have met history head on their work is not the work of victim it is the work of combatant of active participant in an explicit culture war proving every day that civic value can help defeat a supposedly superior adversary we don t always have sufficient resource to speak to this evil and be treated a equal the viper tongued poet and novelist serhiy zhadan writes in sky above kharkiv his forthcoming book that chronicle life in the city a cluster munition have

campaign with a one word slogan overlaid on image of soldier firefighter grandpa dog walker the word is bravery a quality we honor in others but have grown lazy in asking of ourselves david too wa an artist propagandist who put bravery at the core of civic life and revisiting radical draftsman after the russian invasion i found that his hard line had taken on the force of a commandment his horatii

silence day are measured not so much by time but by volume yesterday wa quieter the morning wa loud but the afternoon when the russian like to increase their shelling in the city s south and east will certainly be louder so go the thinking of many of bakhmut s remaining resident it s louder than usual said valeriy a bakhmut resident who declined to give his last name a the crescendo of artillery reverberated off his apartment block on tuesday but they re shooting every day in recent month russian force have made bakhmut one of the focal point in their quest to capture the eastern donbas region the city s altered acoustic are one result of near constant bombardment since the summer and by far the most present the thud and blast echo for mile with a pre war population of around bakhmut once had a far different feeling with child playing tourist visiting the city s renowned winery and walking path bustling with resident on tuesday the sound in the city center were howling dog sheared strip of damaged roofing clattering and a singing older woman who wa otherwise drowned out by the diesel engine of a ukrainian tank lumbering toward the front line beyond the ruined multistory building and the soviet wide road is the seemingly unending back and forth of artillery some people refer to it sarcastically a rocket tennis the shelling is background noise until it isn t it seriousness is deciphered by determining distance direction and volume distant tapping machine gun fire loud bang nearby outgoing mortar muffled bang further away outgoing howitzer salvo of distant thud outgoing rocket whistle overhead artillery shell in flight loud whistle followed by loud crump incoming fire ear shattering blast that break window and set off car alarm run to the basement throw yourself to the ground do whatever it take to live further outside bakhmut the sound merge together in the distant hill sharp crack of ukrainian artillery break through the thud in the city irina a

from the donbas and want to be on the front again the head of primorye with the political observer of the kp ru alexander gamov more subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next in recent week the shelling of donetsk ha intensified everyone ha noticed this both the expert of the jccc joint center for control and coordination and the townspeople themselves but there ha probably been no such shelling since the cannibalistic logic of the artilleryman of the armed force of ukraine and their commander is clear the western and it air defense which wa supposed to protect ukraine from strike on the energy infrastructure absolutely leaky doe not really work so they will take revenge on those whom they can reach ordinary citizen since the summer donetsk ha noticed that ukrainian artilleryman began to choose paradoxical target when shelling the city center not building but road and sidewalk jccc expert unofficially confirmed to the kp special cortex this is not an accident so the scattering of fragment is higher which mean that more people will be hooked or killed the republican authority had information that the shelling of donetsk would continue and intensify it is no coincidence that the head of the republic on monday evening ordered to transfer a many employee a possible to remote work but it is impossible to transfer everyone to remote again the target for the shelling wa the covered market in the city center a few month ago in september he wa covered with artillery hit by a minibus there were killed and wounded on the covered during the day especially at noon it is always crowded there is a very good and cheap canteen employee from numerous office have lunch in it there is also donmak the donbas analogue of the american fast food chain and dozen of stall with fast food there are always queue near them sometimes you need to stand for a couple of ten of minute student manager doctor guaranteed crowd guaranteed casualty how many were killed and wounded in this shelling remain to be determined at the moment it is known that grad shell and missile hit the courthouse and the prosecutor s office the centaur plaza office building the donbas arena area and the covered market traditionally pushkin boulevard wa shelled the day is sunny and the freak knew that there would be a lot of people and most likely mother with child it also went to the neighboring makiivka a huge satellite city half the size of donetsk in makiivka they tried to hit the power substation the only thing that the gunner of the armed force of ukraine achieved wa that people began to move from the once calm center to the outskirt but there are no quiet outskirt in donetsk not yet paradoxically in the moment of the shelling of donetsk the president of ukraine allegedly calmly posed near the stele painted in zhovto blakit color at the entrance to slavyansk the resident of donetsk were literally infuriated by this fact more than another shelling of the city they do not understand why zelensky calmly walk around the donbas read also russia ha dealt one of the most powerful blow to ukraine zelensky locked himself in a bunker in kirovograd odessa and zhytomyr region emergency blackout began more we will stand shoulder to shoulder back to back we are ready the ex head of chita who left his post for the sake of a special operation went to the fron ex head of chita alexander sapozhnikov wa escorted to the front more subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next russia s enemy will not earn money in crimea this is a principled position the head of crimea sergei aksyonov launched the next stage of nationalization in november the authority of the peninsula in one fell swoop transferred to the ownership of the republic more than object which until recently were owned by several ukrainian politician and businessmen those receiving a very good profit from the peninsula calmly sponsored the army of ukraine in the crimea they hint the accomplice of the kiev regime still have a lot of property and business left here so this is not the end how did they manage to do business in the russian crimea while supporting the kiev regime and which of the ukrainian noble wa prepared to part with the asset for answer komsomolka special correspondent alexei ovchinnikov went to the peninsula waited the native factory is also back from the entrance of the bakhchisaray plant stroyindustria worker come out with satisfied smile discus the latest news about the change of ownership many of u have relative and friend on special operation and it wa very annoying to think that we are helping kiev freak who spend money on those who kill our guy and shell the same donetsk they know what they re talking about until november this giant the largest cement producer in crimea belonged to kiev official and oligarch and wa also managed from there look where the chief sat kyiv kiev kiev they show me a stack of minute of meeting of the supervisory board they made money here but they supported the nationalist the ultimate beneficiary beneficiary of the plant were not named at different time the name of the former president of ukraine petro poroshenko and mp david zhvania who died under mysterious circumstance in zaporozhye in may this year surfaced a small share belonged to another former mp mykola martynenko whom the ukrainian press called one of the main sponsor of the former prime minister of ukraine arseniy yatsenyuk the three largest block of share of were recorded in the name of nikolaidis panikas a citizen of cyprus a standard scheme for conducting murky business leaving the henchman of the kiev owner left behind a lot of curious paper for example the decision of the supervisory board according to which it chairman a citizen of ukraine maxim nesterenko is assigned a salary of million ruble and from this accounting statement you can find out that he earned million ruble for the period from january to september salary wa apparently exchanged for currency cashed out and went to kiev a well a million ruble of the plant s net profit last year and tax were at least paid yes all million ruble for were paid to the russian budget for which i thank them of course representative of the new administration laugh the former manager who obediently carried out the will of kiev were suspended from work immediately after the nationalization of the plant and it s not just about fraudulent scheme to withdraw money and obedience other member of the previous administration were noted for their pro ukrainian position and action factory worker recall with indignation recent event when immediately after the terrorist attack on the crimean bridge builder appealed to the plant with a request to allocate cement and concrete for it restoration and they were dumbfounded when the then general director sergei lukyanets threw up his hand after a pause we cannot single out because all the volume are painted for several month ahead obviously consulted with kiev factory worker are sure all decision on the release of large volume of cement were made only there another large ukrainian business that fell under nationalization were four construction store of the company novacenter k until all of them were part of the business empire of the ukrainian oligarch and deputy of the verkhovna rada oleksandr gerega and his wife galina and were called exactly the same a the other of his giant store epicenter the return of crimea forced him to change the sign and cypriot offshore company appeared between him and his crimean store revenue from hypermarket still went to kiev promoting it higher in the forbes rating for the spouse fortune wa estimated at billion in open anti russian activity this character wa noted in having opened another store in kiev he promised to transfer the first million hryvnia earned from him to the ukrainian army and he did not rest on this openly continuing to supply and arm the armed force of ukraine and not hesitating to declare it in early march of this year gerega proudly put up a photo in social network where he in the company of like minded people clutch a machine gun kiev in total the geregas spent more than million on this constantly receiving certificate and gratitude from the ukrainian commander fighting in the donbas for supporting the kiev regime both spouse in were included in the sanction list of russia but all this did not prevent him from simultaneously extracting money in the crimea the revenue of novacenter k last year amounted to billion ruble and net profit million for which gerega periodically came under the criticism of ukrainian propagandist this is what happens with one hand you help the armed force of ukraine and with the other hundred of million of ruble you give to the hated moskals and in one of the interview alexander gerega suddenly revealed himself speaking to reporter he avoided answering this question for some time saying that he knew nothing about the activity of epicenter in crimea and then he suddenly added maybe we are related to these company and are working underground in enemy territory to start a fire sooner or later and these territory will also become a independent a our country and apparently gerega did not lie when talking about underground work you have no idea what happened here employee of the nationalized novacenter share a in the case of the bakhchisaray tsemzavod they are also happy about what happened manager it seems really picked up with ukrainian and anti russian sentiment the office wa completely pro ukrainian direct aggression wa not shown but it is worth going to their page mom dear solid zhovto blakit hopak and so surreptitiously they brought their position then one or another manager wore a bracelet with the color of the ukrainian flag people recall one of the ukrainian report in which a kiev journalist call the personnel department of the crimean novacenter and you can t get a job with a ukrainian passport unfortunately so far these are the condition they sigh there and in the sevastopol store what ha it come to continue the company s employee on the day of the navy and the black sea fleet we met guest in vest everyone liked it except for these they called and recommended to remove them and this is in the city of russian sailor once we in our department disobeyed and the security service wa set against u coming up with fine they openly posted in social network how they sponsor the armed force of ukraine and all sort of detachment said alexandra romanenko head of the temporary administration of novacenter once she already worked here a a general director but three year ago she resigned after seeing gray scheme to withdraw money to kiev many of the former office held relevant view which they broadcast to seller gerega s confidant in sevastopol leonid piyak for example wa allocated percent of the share for loyalty a far a i know the money wa withdrawn in cash each company had it own cashier it wa piyak who wa responsible for these operation his entire family is in kiev and work in the supervisory authority supporting ukraine the bulk of the family of senior manager of the company are also in kiev and the manager themselves ten people some of them fled there with the beginning of the svo and continued to lead remotely some left with the beginning of mobilization some sincerely rejoiced at the terrorist attack on the crimean bridge none of that will happen again work many even returned after learning of the removal of pro ukrainian chief so the removal of manager from the helm that followed the nationalization is also a security issue who know what they secretly prepared there we are also pleased with what happened in kerch where the property of the shipyard wa nationalized the water area and the embankment it turned out that in the ukrainian period the oligarch who previously owned the plant managed to privatize them now this formality ha been eliminated but apparently this is not the last act of nationalization official at different level are increasingly saying that the accomplice of the kiev regime still have a lot of property and business in the crimea the difficulty is that in rescuing the hard earned gain they diligently covered their track rewriting the business on dummy and you need to work hard to distinguish an honest acquirer from the zitz chairman many political ukrainian also have apartment on the peninsula the most famous of them is zelensky s apartment in livadia which still belongs to his family but it may very well be that mr president may soon lose them i would gladly take zelensky s apartment and give it to refugee from donbas yalta mayor yanina pavlenko said not so long ago so far this is private property but in case of nationalization i will personally petition the head of the republic to transfer housing to child from the dpr i very much hope for a positive outcome there is a list for nationalization and it is very large nikolai volkov head of the state council of crimea committee on culture continued the topic on the air of the crimea channel we also have the house of sofia rotaru in yalta she promised to build a house for talented child and now she is trying to sell it for a lot of money we should take it away of course it should be a holiday home for child crimea under ukraine wa a platform where ukrainian official earned a lot of money received bribe with land and immediately built it up with hotel restaurant started other business and their name are known crimean public figure and blogger alexander talipov suggests that it is still possible to nationalize at one time lyudmila denisova the same ex ombudsman of ukraine who wrote story about the mass rape of civilian by russian soldier from baby to grandmother ed squeezed a considerable amount of land in the crimea she ha a lot of apartment here an operating business a real estate agency an advertising agency all this ha been re registered to daughter and other person the daughter a far a i know received russian passport in and with the beginning of the svo left for kiev i found their apartment and house in yalta and simferopol there is such a famous boxer oleksandr usyk who call for the military liberation of the crimea and even joined the ukrainian territorial defense but at the same time he forgets that his mother life in the crimea and several real estate object including hotel are registered for her it is clear that the old mother wa never an entrepreneur and manager usyk s wife ha parent here who are also registered business there are a lot of them and i think all this can be calculated official vladimir andreevich what prevented the nationalization of these facility several year ago because the anti russian position of the former owner ha long been known we work in the legal field of russia until the last our country adhered to the position of inviolability of private property a much a possible except for certain critical situation after russia began to be robbed by those who most loudly declared the sanctity of private property to arrest and nationalize the property of our state legal entity and individual our position changed even now we only nationalize the property of those who directly participate in or sponsor military operation against the russian army in fact they encourage the murder of our citizen foreign citizen who do not commit such atrocity against russia can still have property in crimea work for u there are no obstacle for them is there any reaction from the former owner to these action i m not aware of any open reaction but we are not very interested in their reaction by and large they were ready for this for a long time and sucked everything they could out of the enterprise there were no surprise for them in this regard there have already been hint that this will not be the last act of nationalization in the republic what other property and asset can be nationalized we are working in this direction i don t want to get ahead of myself yet now the anti terrorist commission reveals the ownership of the property we guarantee that the employee of such enterprise will remain in their place no layoff will be carried out often they themselves turn to u with request to deal with the owner for u for the entire crimean society it is important not to allow the accomplice of the criminal kiev regime to earn money on our land depriving them of such an opportunity would be a fair decision subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next in the footage the truck enters the

hundred thousand year old city subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next the german parliament believing in another ukrainian lie recognized the holodomor a genocide however the truth about that tragedy lie on the surface say our columnist nikolai varsego did stalin know in that a terrible famine wa approaching ukraine like other region of the ussr i had this question from reading an article by gareth johnson a reporter for the time published in here s a quick excerpt the situation in ukraine and in the whole of russia is terrible everything is lousy there is no food there is only bread i ve seen something so bad that it me off when i think about how people like bernard shaw go to a place where they re led by the nose they eat plenty and then they call russia a paradise winter will bring great suffering people are starving one of the reason why i left yuzovka donetsk so quickly is that i managed to find only a loaf of bread from food i had nothing more to eat until seven o clock many ukrainian are so weak that they are unable to work nevertheless tremendous progress ha been made in many sector and there is a good chance that with the completion of the five year plan russia can become successful the communist achieved excellent result in education hygiene and the fight against drunkenness price are monstrous and shoe can not be found there s nothing in the store how is it that there is a famine in ukraine and western reporter are easily allowed there and this is at a time when the ussr is desperately creating an image of the most prosperous country in the same in the land of the soviet a film wa released on the russian and even in yiddish the return of nathan becker plot the jew nathan foolishly left the ussr for america having suffered grief there he returned to the ussr again but with a comrade in misfortune a negro and now in the land of the soviet nathan and the negro have known all the joy of life thanks to socialism the leadership of the ussr spared neither effort nor money for the pr of their country almost every film told how happy cheerful well fed soviet people live in contrast to the unfortunate one in the country of capitalism and the joy sings uncontacted and the song go towards it and people laugh when they meet and the oncoming sun rise and then a western reporter came and wrote this we can safely assume that the kremlin doe not yet know about hunger with either an ear or a snout they do not know because the local leadership report only on success the soviet press of course doe not write anything about the famine but now ukrainian liar declaring genocide paint u approximately the following picture the russian comrade stalin dzhugashvili gathering his associate said let s arrange genocide against ukrainian through the holodomor because these ukrainian according to russophobes are advanced people and are dangerous for moscow so the kremlin approved the plan of genocide and at the same time no one realized that the death of ukrainian from exhaustion would not only spoil the image of the land of the soviet but also kill leave completely without worker ukrainian plant factory which in the same were built throughout ukraine according to another plan of the kremlin after all at the same time the first current wa issued by the largest in all of europe dneproges the metallurgy giant azovstal is being completed hundred of plant and factory are being built and expanded from kharkiv to kherson and odessa ukraine ha the widest scope of industrialization actually this industrialization became one of the three cause of famine because village plowman massively poured into the construction site of socialism and there wa almost no one to work in the field only in in this regard a law would be passed prohibiting villager from moving to the city otherwise famine would strike again the second cause of the famine a you know wa a terrible drought and the third reason of course is the stupidity in the management of agriculture the famine then struck not only ukraine but also kazakhstan the caucasus western siberia the volga region the central black earth region of russia and if anything the death toll from starvation in the rsfsr is no le than in ukraine and russia can also appeal to their bundestag with a request to recognize the genocide of

portal history rf russia is attacking ukraine s energy infrastructure methodically disabling substation after substation report say that city and even entire area remain immersed in darkness transport utility do not work on the front russia also began to press the ukrainian army recapturing village after village even the west is in a panic about whether it is necessary to continue to maintain such a black independent hole and winter is coming will ukraine be able to survive it with this question we turned to the ex deputy of the verkhovna rada the former speaker of the parliament of novorossiya oleg tsarev why ha russia already inflicted several massive blow on the energy facility of ukraine because these are the object that are easiest to disable where the effectiveness of missile attack is maximum these are transformer substation such transformer are not produced in ukraine i myself once built a factory i know how much the network cost design manufacture order installation very long and expensive that s why the substation are being hit we beat the light go out and after a day or a week everything is already in order television work heat is supplied repair thanks to the ukrainian propaganda for the blissful picture we and ukrainian too see only a small part of what is happening in the energy sector of ukraine light in home is not the main thing most of the energy go to industrial facility and they suffer and it is more and more difficult to repair each time we know this in peaceful life a transformer broke down spare line were turned on electrician arrived new part were inserted and that s it but today these reserve are becoming le and le and they themselves say that a few more blow and the system will fall there will be no single energy system there will be only island throughout ukraine which will supply electricity sporadically no light everything will stand up i remember it well from lugansk donetsk crimea our civilization is based on electricity if it doesn t we re falling into the stone age mobile communication subway sewerage heating pump should pump water do not work there is no water business stand up there is no place to work to receive a salary will the train get up and the delivery of weapon from the west since the blessed soviet time we have a huge number of diesel locomotive that were in reserve at junction station they were kept specifically in case of war so ala they will provide a minimum cargo flow what do people think what are their mood of course life without light and without work doe not inspire optimism yes propaganda assures that this on the contrary will strengthen the resolve of ukrainian mobilize them it s not that my ukrainian friend perceive all this a a catastrophe that is approaching and it is unclear when there will be a way out and an outcome why then many decided to stay in ukraine first of all men can t leave secondly there are still hope look at the authority they do not say that there will be a catastrophe they say it s overdue soon many believe wait and there are those who are waiting for the arrival of russia i have a lot of appeal stop shelling u it is better to come faster occupy the territory how long can you wait there really are a lot of them i won t say the majority but they are that s for sure this is written by friend and just subscriber to my telegram channel and what are people in ukraine thinking about now about politics or how to keep warm when the light are turned off people begin to be interested in the simplest household thing how to eat where to charge the phone when to have time to collect water turning off heating in city is yet to come it s going to be a disaster but already now people pay le attention to front line report politics is not watched on tv and the tv itself is le likely to work i have no doubt that this worry zelensky s office what to expect in winter at the front i can only speculate but apparently the strategy is to strengthen the defense in zaporozhye and luhansk region and move the front line away from donetsk so that there is no shelling of the city ideally walk to slavyansk and unblock the water supply to donetsk vodokanal is blocked by ukraine there so you don t expect active movement so far i can t see anything that would portend that it is clear that our ministry of defense doe not lay out plan but we are accustomed to the fact that foreign intelligence closely monitor the entire theater of military operation and leak data on the movement of our troop to the press but for now they are silent the west took ukraine on the maintenance completely give weapon money will he have the reserve and patience to feed ukraine this winter we have heard statement that the west is tired of ukraine but there is an important factor from the point of view of the west the conflict with russia in ukraine is actually a confrontation between russian and russian ideally for russian money they themselves spend a tiny amount on this compared to the same afghanistan the war in which according to various estimate cost from a trillion to three trillion dollar so far the west ha spent only billion on ukraine and what doe for russian money mean the west arrested half of russia s gold and foreign exchange reserve that s billion and they are preparing to confiscate this money plus the asset of russian corporation and businessmen were arrested another billion compare the european union ha so far allocated only billion to ukraine this is even le than the interest on the capital seized from u such a conflict in ukraine is beneficial to the west we have the opportunity to prevent the confiscation of our reserve for example in response we have not yet arrested anything from the west on our territory on the contrary we have paid billion on loan alone this year that s a lot of money perhaps this attitude can be revised instead of bottom line they will feel what they themselves did with donbas yes ukraine will be able to survive the winter oleg tsarev sum up even without many of the benefit of civilization those who say no should look at the territory of donbas there are now almost the same problem with electricity water heating in the same way ukraine hit transformer and other infrastructure of the city of the dpr lpr for ukraine it will be an unusual terrible life but many in kiev kharkiv mykolaiv will be able to feel for themselves what they themselves did for eight year with donetsk and lugansk expert comment professor of mgimo director of the center for military political study alexey podberezkin how much the west can pour into ukraine at all of course he can the question is how effective from a military technical point of view this effectiveness is already minimal everything that wa in the warehouse ha already been swept away they began to withdraw from the nato troop yes the u military industrial complex is capable of unwinding but it s not fast either i think at the beginning of when the result of expense for are similar they will think at least in the eu country but in the same nato they do not cease to declare support for ukraine will continue and intensify the wording will help strengthen doe not oblige to anything yes they will supply transformer of some kilowatt can this replace ukraine s energy system of course not and they will not be able to make large transformer during this time winter ha already begun kiev happily reported that the first ship with grain in the framework of the grain from ukraine program reached ethiopia it delivered ton of wheat another ship is preparing to be sent to somalia the grain from ukraine program last fall in his video for the participant of the g summit wa proposed by the sixth president of the independent country the scheme is a follows country that support the initiative buy agricultural product from ukrainian producer and then transfer it to country on the verge of famine one question is why are there mediator here and the current gift is le than a quarter of a percent of what kiev ha already pushed to the west a part of a grain deal u s intelligence belief that in the coming month the pace of combat operation in the independent sector will decrease u s national intelligence chief avril haynes said at a forum organized in california by the reagan presidential foundation we are already seeing that the pace of the conflict ha slowed somewhat and expect to see it in the coming month but haynes is concerned about how the situation in the conflict zone will develop on the eve of spring well how it will develop stream will run and wash away all the dirt in the dnieper and in the black sea lara seligman a columnist for politico suggested that aid to kiev would be reduced if washington adopted a one year funding resolution instead of a full fledged military budget seligman writes pentagon official have compiled a list of serious consequence if the military for the first time in history ha to act under a one year interim funding law from aid to ukraine to problem with the purchase of new b bomber the resolution will cut pentagon funding by billion or percent compared to president joe biden s request for fiscal year that would delay the modernization of the industrial base for a number of key system including the abrams tank and the m towed howitzer the latter among the weapon the u s military is transferring to ukraine well they will do without the three ax a military diplomatic source told ria novosti that kiev is preparing a provocation to disrupt the un

recorded for our fighter and younger schoolchildren will make gift and christmas decoration to stop russia s relentless offensive in the artyomovsk direction ukraine is throwing reserve into battle and trying to use nato s advanced tactic but general surovikin prof his highest qualification arranging a real russian meat grinder on the contact line for the enemy at the same time our command on the contrary try to protect it soldier a much a possible taking the upper hand in the artillery confrontation due to the number and quality of military equipment what is happening on the line of the highest tension of force in the donbas why do nato coin tactic not work against russia and what is the strategic importance of artemovsk bakhmut these question on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda were answered by a military expert ta observer retired colonel viktor litovkin when it come to bakhmut artemovsk hot news come from there kiev admits that this is a problem for them it s hard there but our military is moving forward why is this strategically important to u because bakhmut which is still under ukrainian control but in fact it is a russian territory and the city is more correctly called artemovsk is an important railway and road junction through it go train convoy carrying weapon and ammunition to the line of clash near artyomovsk there are salt mine where military equipment ammunition where ukrainian hospital are located and much more from there come the replenishment of the ukrainian army including although this replenishment is not always sufficiently prepared but this is a replenishment which is still led after all mainly not by ukrainian major and colonel but more often by american instructor and even more often by pole the enemy s loss in this area are great there are a lot of them dying it s just that ukraine in the donbas is plugging the gap of it defense with human flesh and that s also why it s quite difficult for u to advance we have fewer people in this area and this factor also matter but we have more artillery installation multiple launch rocket system and we of course continue to advance but we are advancing rather slowly because we are confronted by the enemy in well equipped position in several echelon with concreted underground structure it is difficult to overcome them without loss very difficult but possible our command always try to do without loss and doe everything to save the life of russian soldier why don t nato s advanced tactic work for ukrainian there s different training kiev often sends it soldier and officer abroad for training but we must understand that abroad they are now simply using a lot of money to train these people therefore they teach them their tactical program at an accelerated pace they rarely meet the immediate condition of battle against a serious and strong army such a the russian one two or three week in the uk do not make rambo out of ukrainian at the british german czech training ground the ukrainian military do not learn the practice of real combat well they shot cardboard target there well went on reconnaissance well they conducted several ambush where no one hurt anyone do they get the skill of real fighting modern tank there or whatever they are taught how to deal with cruise missile they don t teach of course not moreover kiev doe not have such air defense system that are capable of intercepting such missile and the ukrainian military is not trained to work on modern air defense system and the system that the west ha managed to supply to ukraine are not ukrainian but representative of those country that supplied these system there are already a lot of them so far a meager amount ha been supplied seven cheetah system cannot block the sky at a distance of a thousand kilometer ukraine is catastrophically losing people ursula von der leyen gave a figure of people but i think this figure wa sharply underestimated their loss are greater for every person killed in battle according to military statistic there are three to four death from wound not counting six or seven wounded or mutilated therefore it is possible to imagine how many people ukraine loses every day without even delving into the statistical data that certain politician cite read also the battle for the key border of donbas ha begun the armed force of ukraine throw soldier to the field of death to stop the offensive of russia voenkor dmitry steshin the situation of the armed force of ukraine near artemovsk is close to critical detail the best interviewer of

yenakiieve enterprise a lot of generation have worked and are working here we hope that our metallurgy will prosper say alexey velmozhin deputy head of the blast furnace shop there is such a film man

fleeing russian occupied territory must bring document certifying their identity and confirming their ukrainian citizenship he said the public call for evacuation while most likely intended to signal

karamalikov s watch leader reported that a team of guard had encountered someone stumbling toward a checkpoint in a strange green uniform slathered in mud looking shellshocked he wasn t a looter he wa a lost russian pilot and they had disarmed him and were keeping him in a school classroom it wa a highly unusual prisoner of war situation a band of civilian capturing an enemy officer in a city that the enemy control nobody knew what to do said mr karamalikov s lawyer mykhailo velychko they couldn t hand him over to ukrainian force there were no ukrainian force in the city at that time and there wa no red cross and the russian were everywhere what followed over the next few hour and continues to play out in court month later reveals the blurred line between complicity and survival that many ukrainian had to navigate after the russian invaded their country and that pose vexing problem for the authority now a they decide whom to punish mr karamalikov brought the captured pilot back to his house and locked him in a utility room later that night he arranged to return the soldier to the russian he saw no other option the ukrainian authority saw thing differently they later arrested mr karamalikov a a collaborator and charged him with treason he is awaiting trial and face life in prison in the area of ukraine that russia ha seized more than a fifth of the country million of civilian have had to coexist with an occupying army that wields all the power the ukrainian have recently clawed back chunk of their territory like kherson which wa liberated in mid november and almost immediately the hunt wa on for collaborator people are now being judged by the choice they made during very stressful occupied time a page indictment accuses mr karamalikov of helping an enemy soldier escape and resume aggression against ukraine but in interview with more than a dozen people in kherson including those who expressed reservation about mr karamalikov s reputation a a domineering businessman all of them said he had done the right thing a head of the neighborhood patrol his supporter said he had to make a decision that would carry grave consequence for him and his community handing the soldier back to the russian seemed to go against the basic principle of war if he had told his people to keep the soldier in captivity in a city controlled by russian troop it could have put everyone involved in danger a for a third option mr karamalikov would not contemplate that his rabbi said with a life in his hand i can t imagine illia ever killing anyone said rabbi yossef itzhak wolff what he did wa the most humane decision he could make rabbi wolff wa speaking by phone from berlin and sounded pained he said he wa not sure when or even if he ll return to ukraine like mr karamalikov he said that some people in town suspect him of collaborating with the russian for what he view a a benign act allowing a few jewish russian officer from the occupying force to join prayer at his temple the rabbi said that the russian officer whom he described a the men who ran the city had showed up at the synagogue with armed guard and that there had been no way to refuse them he said that he and his family could have left kherson at the beginning of the war and avoided all this a so many police officer and politician did but that they had stayed and the wall of their house shook from shelling all these people who ran away are judging u he said these are cruel time the russian stormed into kherson on feb the first day of the war thundering up from the crimean peninsula with an ease that raised suspicion of local complicity the ukrainian government is now investigating several intelligence officer suspected of leaking critical information on kherson s defense to the russian the security service fled the army disappeared police officer vanished from the street it wa a city without a head rabbi wolff said many resident said they were in a state of shock they felt abandoned by ukrainian force and wondered why they didn t put up more of a fight right now we support zelensky but after the war we will come back to him and ask him about this said valentyn yermolenko a retired fisherman who lived through the occupation and provided snack and hot coffee to the neighborhood watchman life in kherson got harder and harder supply couldn t get across the front line and the city with a prewar population of about began to run out of food the looting became so bad resident said that thief rolled freezer stocked with the last frozen chicken in town out of the supermarket and down the main road it wa insane said oleksandr samoylenko a politician and head of kherson s regional council who left when the russian invaded kherson wa under russian occupation but the russian weren t interested in taking over the administration the water the sale thing the market they didn t want the headache mr karamalikov stepped in along with some other city leader he organized the citizen patrol men mostly unarmed some with stick who prowled kherson s street after dark they arrested curfew violator and petty criminal sometimes making them pick up garbage or perform other community service it wa a short lived grass root criminal justice system mr karamalikov had something of a godfather reputation in his city at nearly six foot tall stocky and well connected across business and politics he owned two popular nightclub amigo and shade and several grocery store he wa known a a man who would engage anyone in the interest of doing business and he rubbed some people the wrong way i don t think he s honest or altruistic and i ll say it to his face said mr samoylenko but in kherson s small jewish community the remnant of what wa once a major strand in this city s fabric mr karamalikov wa widely respected before the holocaust rabbi wolff said kherson had temple now there is only one left kherson s chabad synagogue and mr karamalikov regularly allowed it to use his nightclub space for free he never said no rabbi wolff said mr karamalikov wa busy during those first chaotic week of the war his lawyer said rushing around kherson in his white audi checking on neighborhood patrol stopping by the synagogue and turning his business into de facto aid depot where he handed out carton of supply this brought him face to face with russian officer in particular a colonel who dressed in all black and went by the code name alpha mr karamalikov had little choice his lawyer said jumpy russian troop were spread across the city and mr karamalikov needed to talk to russian commander like alpha to make sure they didn t shoot any of the volunteer around p m on march a plumber a carpenter and the carpenter s son were standing at a checkpoint when they saw the silhouette of someone flitting in and out of the shadow a voice then yelled out i m one of you and out stepped the russian soldier who had mistaken the neighborhood watchman for fellow russian andriy skvortsov the carpenter s son said the soldier wa bewildered and barely able to string a sentence together when he realized the men in front of him were ukrainian he looked extremely frightened mr skvortsov said he wa childlike and helpless mr skvortsov said and he wa heavily armed when they patted him down they found one short barreled ak one makarov officer s pistol and five ammunition magazine they also found his military identification card showing he wa lieutenant dmitrii pavlovich savchenko a combat helicopter pilot from his discombobulated speech they pieced together that he had walked nearly mile from kherson s airport which the ukrainian had just shelled killing many russian the watchman took the soldier to a school and called mr karamalikov there wa no easy solution the red cross which handle prisoner issue wa not operating in kherson at the time and there wa no way to get the captured pilot to ukrainian force who were mile away despite all the anti russian feeling coursing through kherson the civilian guard did not mistreat the soldier a small crowd curious gathered around him and some took selfies mr karamalikov s lawyer said that his client wa determined to treat the soldier humanely and what he ultimately did wa in accord with the geneva convention mr karamalikov called alpha and they arranged to meet in the morning until then the soldier would stay at his house at daybreak mr karamalikov met alpha and handed over the russian soldier what mr karamalikov didn t know his lawyer said wa that ukrainian intelligence agent had tapped alpha s phone and heard the whole discussion by mid april the russian had imported hundred of intelligence agent and other security officer into kherson who arrested many civilian and tortured some of them at the same time ukrainian security service had their own network of informant in the city and were keeping tab on anyone suspected of collaborating with the russian mr karamalikov decided it wa time to go on april he packed his wife his mother in law and three of his five child into two car to drive mile to odesa a ukrainian controlled city a soon a they crossed into ukrainian territory they were stopped ukrainian intelligence agent pulled mr karamalikov out of his car and took him away his family and lawyer said he wa brought to an interrogation center in kryvyi rih beaten all over his body cut with sharp object on his leg and injected with drug and forced to talk official in kherson declined to comment on the allegation of torture but acknowledged that at least two of the agent involved in the treatment of mr karamalikov have been placed under investigation it s hard to believe that our own country which is committed to democracy and ha it own law would do this his son artem said in a phone interview in the indictment prosecutor said that by releasing the soldier mr karamalikov organized the further participation of a russian serviceman in aggression against ukraine they also charged him with leaking personnel data on military veteran and pro ukrainian political figure his lawyer said he didn t do that and that the information wa already publicly available prosecutor also accused him of producing a positive image of russia by distributing russian humanitarian aid and helping make russian propaganda video which his lawyer denied but the crux of the case his lawyer said wa the captured soldier and to this day we have asked a question that no one can answer what else in those circumstance in that city at that time wa he supposed to do the kherson prosecutor s office declined to respond to that shane darcy an international law professor at the irish center for human right of the university of galway ha been following medium report on collaborator investigation in ukraine including the karamalikov case it sound like a collaboration this wa a particularly innocuous example handing over a dazed and confused soldier mr darcy said but he added it s not for me to define for the ukrainian what they consider collaboration mr samoylenko the local politician said that despite his misgiving about mr karamalikov s integrity the decision to hand over the pilot wa absolutely right there wa nothing else you could do he said adding that it would have been dangerous for everyone involved to keep him a a prisoner even after all that ha unfolded in kherson in the past nine month mr skvortsov the watchman seems deeply moved by what happened that night we wondered later should we have killed the soldier and kept it secret he said but i ve decided no that wouldn t have been good i remember seeing the body and the body part at the beginning of the war ours and theirs he said we did the right thing but the ministry also assessed that despite the immense amount of resource thrown into the fight for the city in donetsk russia stand to gain little strategic advantage if it is successful in capturing bakhmut following ukriane s success in mid september when it ousted russian force from the neighboring kharkiv region to the west ukrainian force have repelled moscow s troop even further east across northern donetsk one source described the fight a a meat grinder for the moscow time this week and ukraine s defense ministry said bakhmut is seeing some of the toughest fighting in ukraine right now donetsk one of the region russia illegally annexed earlier this year ha seen constant fighting since the war began nine month ago caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news the serviceman of the armed force of ukraine in artemovsk in ukraine bakhmut whose operational encirclement in the dpr is now carried out by russian troop are demoralized and ready to leave the fortified area at the same time a military expert captain of the first rank of the reserve vasily dandykin said on the air of the radio komsomolskaya pravda the state of their spirit wa influenced not only by the advance of russian troop in this direction but also by the data on loss voiced by the head of the european commission ursula von der leyen recall she said that since february ukraine ha lost more than thousand people we tell you the latest news about the situation for today december in artemovsk ursula von der leyen s statement ha fallen on this ground vasily dandykin said but the most important thing is probably different the fact that the connection they have with relative and friend remains according to starlink they not only carry out some operation but also communicate with the house and there are really dozen buried in every even small village except for those who are missing who are buried by our guy after all in reality according to our calculation the figure are much worse and larger and the military of the armed force of ukraine know this and under pressure under this fire shaft here both the storm and the unit with the mobilized are already involved all this add up into one staggering and fuss begin there are panic mood among senior officer commander and this is transmitted through the chain to the extreme to the soldier in recent day the russian military ha been conducting active hostility in the artyomovsk direction their goal is to cut off the group in artemovsk from communication and panic mood are superimposed on the lack of an order from kiev to withdraw the armed force of ukraine seem to intend to defend the settlement to the last soldier according to vasily dandykin this is due to the fact that this is a very important milestone for kiev and not only for kyiv but also for it sponsor the expert say if the armed force of ukraine leave the position near artemovsk it mean that the next line will pa exactly before slavyansk and kramatorsk this mean that our troop will approach one of the main goal the liberation of the entire donbas and the dpr subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next according to a number of sign the position of the armed force of ukraine near artemovsk bakhmut is close to critical at the same time there were many pathetic report in the western press rumor about the evacuation and withdrawal from artemovsk zelensky s alleged order to hold the city at any cost and all this against the backdrop of a slow but steady advance of our troop voenkor kp tried to understand this array of information donbas ha a very painful point which ha been under the control of ukraine since the summer of this is the agglomeration konstantinovka druzhkovka kramatorsk slavyansk nikolaevka if we occupy it the territory of the dpr in fact will be completely liberated from the occupier there on the outskirt of slavyansk the whole problem of water supply of donbas is hidden in february ukraine blocked the supply of water from the seversky donets canal stopped pumping station over the past summer it became clear that alternative water conduit well and boreholes of donbas cannot be watered there is only one way out the capture of slavyansk kramatorsk but first we will have to take artemovsk and the surrounding village the enemy will be forced to withdraw from the field and overflowing forest plantation into urban development or he will be kicked out yesterday our armed force were knocked out of the village of kurdyumovka the village is located on a high rise and from it you can even see the outskirt of kramatorsk it is a little more than kilometer in a straight line and most importantly now the road from artemovsk to chasov yar where the reserve of the armed force of ukraine are concentrated fall under our fire control operational encirclement is still far away but the position of the group defending artemovsk will immediately become complicated moreover from the north the town of soledar loom over artyomovsk and there are also battle in it occupy our soledar artemovsk immediately find itself in a semi encirclement the armed force of ukraine and their western adviser are well aware of all this therefore the battle taking place in these place have already been called the bakhmut meat grinder in ukraine western colleague were the first to fly near artemovsk the most representative pool imaginable ha arrived cnn the new york time etc a newsweek correspondent wrote ukrainian soldier squatting in the middle of a gloomy landscape reminiscent of the killing field of the first world war they began to post video on the web a five star hotel in position near bakhmut artemovsk in these video the zachistas are drowning up to their ear in impassable mud then cnn posted a video report about the defense of bakhmut artemovsk in addition to the brave shooting from an almost century old american machine gun the plot had several inclusion from the street of the city from which it wa clear that it wa under our continuous artillery fire the command of the defender sits in a nice brick basement and look on the big screen for a picture from their copters they have nothing else to do azovstal wa also watched to the last what is happening on the street the ukrainian military itself sitting directly in the trench write in social network about the lack of shell for counter battery warfare and our cover the available stock of shell were spent a few day ago during an unsuccessful counterattack of the armed force of ukraine and the delivery of ammunition is difficult due to ukrainian problem with electricity the main fleet of locomotive on electric traction at the same time a in the note a it wa in debaltseve for example or during the storming of mariupol the officer of the armed force of ukraine have already openly begun to complain about the unbearable life according to the commander of the svoboda battalion pyotr kuzik a major of the national guard everything is very bad near artyomovsk they the armed force of the russian federation author s note felt weak in our defense because there are unit that are le motivated than ours and yesterday we pushed through our defense in the area of bakhmut a little some unit could not withstand the artillery onslaught and retreated according to a new york time journalist who worked on the ground now the fighting near artemovsk ha turned into an artillery duel while the loss of the armed force of ukraine are terrible people a day killed and wounded it is curious that this information wa confirmed by the data of our radio intercept the loss are significant so from the zaporozhye direction to artemovsk they began to transfer part of the armed force of ukraine battalion it can be assumed that now ukraine is considering the possibility of leaving artemovsk bakhmut and is gradually accustoming it population to this idea the very idea of surrender wa voiced through the western medium most likely this is caused by a real operational necessity and western military adviser insisted on this the ukrainian propagandist arestovich immediately worked out the subpoena saying that the loss of bakhmut is a minor unimpressive success of the russian army other ukrainian politician also spoke about the loss of the city in general the word kramatorsk ha recently been heard more and more often there is an airfield and a railway station the city is conveniently located to become an indestructible stronghold unlike artemovsk bakhmut but apparently at the moment the final decision on artemovsk bakhmut ha not been made by the leadership of ukraine and it will depend only on the successful action of our army and there seems to be success numerous boiler through which the armed force of ukraine passed developed in ukrainian officer just an animal sense of encirclement according to the officer of the people s militia of the lpr andriy marochko in artemovsk the ukrainian officer have already strained very much in anticipation of the evacuation order which still doe not come it is possible that officer of the emergency force will use the service of private tow truck yes in artemovsk there are such for an immodest reward they are ready to take people and cargo out of the city from kg to ton they are ready to evacuate business and production promise golden mountain registration of benefit temporary residence etc in practice people after evacuation buy the last valuable thing well where will you with this washing machine be in removable hut and provide them to themselves in artemovsk bakhmut there are still about thousand civilian they refuse to leave the armed force of ukraine frankly do not like them they call them waiting this is a new word that ha appeared in recent month a usual the western press wa not particularly interested in the fate of the civilian of artemovsk these are wrong peaceful one their salvation lie only in a successful russian offensive and they know this well read also the truth about the terrible loss of the armed force of ukraine kiev is shaking from the treacherous blow of the european commission from zelensky relative demand to disclose information about the fate of entire brigade of the armed force of ukraine and he is silent more

analysis about the conflict million of ukrainian are bracing for a winter of worsening hardship russian airstrikes have knocked out power and other utility depriving household of electricity heating and water the attack are raising fear about a collapse of ukraine s energy grid which would push many vulnerable ukrainian to the brink for more insight on the crisis i spoke to denise brown the u n s resident coordinator in ukraine who is responsible for overseeing the international humanitarian response denise took up her position in august and ha since been traveling around the country to see how people are coping our conversation ha been condensed and edited denise let s start with your recent travel where have you been and what is the situation there in the past two week i ve been to kherson twice mykolaiv and the sumy region in kherson two week ago i saw empty grocery store there wa nothing not a crumb supply chain were disrupted many older people were still there and were very happy to see u you could sense their relief when i wa back there this past sunday it wa different first of all it wa much colder they are re establishing the power line but because of the mine progress is slow electricity is linked to water which is linked to heating so it wa cold there were three grocery store open and the one that wa empty two week ago wa full and there were people waiting to get into the grocery store i felt that after the hope and relief two week earlier people were worried extremely worried what is the biggest humanitarian concern heading into winter what i worry about is the damage to the energy infrastructure we knew that winter wa coming in our humanitarian response plan there s a very specific component dedicated to winter we planned for that but it s the damage to the energy infrastructure which is the new dimension which is overwhelming and which give all of u cause to worry the humanitarian community ha been reaching million people since the war started a the energy infrastructure damage grows if at some point it all disappears what then that s the question the generator are super super important how many generator can we bring in to run the hospital to run the heating center to run everything how many can everybody bring in from our humanitarian community we believe we can bring in and the spare part that have been requested that have to come from outside the country to keep the system up and running it s an absolute primary objective to keep people safe you need electricity water and heating that s the biggest worry everybody s biggest worry where are the most vulnerable i think right now it is the kherson kharkiv and zaporizhzhia region the data that we have suggests that which is why i spend most of my time going back and forth to these area when we go to these area we see a lot of elderly people who didn t have the mean to move or didn t want to leave their home behind we also worry about woman alone with child we worry a lot about people with disability who may be on their own we tend to focus a lot on those group to provide them with support not just materially but also psychologically people have been living in community under temporary russian control on the face of people i see stress and anxiety i ve been greeted by scream and cry in some place moving forward there will be huge gap if the energy structure collapse the worst case scenario from my point of view is people left on their own the elderly woman with child people with disability we need to make sure we know where they are if we don t that s a big problem the linkage to local organization is key because they are present in those area are you seeing any sign of a possible exodus a new wave of refugee we haven t noticed any movement across the border i don t think ukrainian want to leave i think they want to stay they have been through a lot already i think they want to see this through how long do you think the war will last are

both dead and wounded but some volunteer are going to go there again after the new year this is how you would comment on this phenomenon which in my opinion and not only in mine brings our victory very closer to be honest i did not quite understand the question peskov began we all belong to the volunteer who not sparing their life not sparing their health there in fact in donbas and ukraine a g defend the fatherland and of course they are all and will be hero for all of u but the crux of the matter is what i didn t quite get it i would like you know what question to ask in connection with this we witnessed the president s piercing meeting with wounded fighter in the hospital with the military at the shooting range with the paratrooper with the mother of our soldier the other day and whether a meeting with civilian volunteer is planned so far there are no specific plan the spokesman said but it is obvious that putin will continue to hold meeting business meeting and separate

uniform since the first day in the trans baikal territory because we have a lot to do with the army let me remind you that chita is the centre of both the siberian and trans baikal military district

russian empire the soviet union the new russia in this territory in the life of the trans baikal territory this mean a lot i see and also i look at what you re having lunch there i understand that it s probably not regular but this is the third time i decided to ask what is happening in the canteen both in the soldier s room and in the officer s room i myself when i served it wa absolutely normal any leader commander chief and so on coming to a military unit necessarily visit the main place of life of the personnel look at what is happening in the barrack in the canteen and especially of course in itself combat training so we re doing the same thing we have no right to give any detail about combat training here and about the canteen i think you can and you were in the officer s room or in the soldier s room all both and where is the best food both are good but our hero alexander sapozhnikov where he eats the time i arrived we all ate sat in the soldier s room and usually alexander sapozhnikov is where officer and warrant officer are having breakfast lunch and dinner and what you were fed i wonder in the soldier s room there in the soldier s dining room there is a choice these are several dish of the first several the second and a lot of salad various appetizer and confectionery i chose for myself beetroot buckwheat without meat fish and so on and vinaigrette and separately they also served such large piece of meat a a snack and senior warrant officer alexander sapozhnikov how what doe he eat there how is the former mayor fed there he s not complaining no it s such a good good quality food it is without any such excessive sweet and delight but it is fresh with a good amount of vegetable nourishing with normal food your mayor ha been serving there for two week now for people the most important thing is probably whether they give meat how much and how there meat is given when i wa there wa a choice of chicken and pork and something like a ham separately cold yet your mayor ha been there for two week now what doe it look like he didn t lose weight no he hasn t lost weight he look good the same healthy complexion he ha a good cheerful spirit when you go there again well i think it s probably before the end of this week or monday or tuesday but it probably is what specific question you can t ask military well i can say they all have individual training now coordination of unit a significant part of the time they spend on this there are standard adapted taking into account the experience of the current military operation there are class during which personnel are trained in a wide range of action maybe a little more detail the first is to use personal small arm grenade grenade launcher and so on in battle and the second is those who have special type of weapon special mean and so on then act using them naturally at the same time they undergo medical training and all this a part of the unit in close cooperation with each other those unit that are equipped with unmanned quadcopters operate with their use that s all that s happening now it s common knowledge but interesting thank you subscribe to the new podcasts of

salvation only by combining their prayer and effort against the western satanist the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want olena zelenska the wife of the president of ukraine finally turned into olena if earlier she wa only the first lady who periodically spoke about her husband country and family now she ha turned into a dirty propagandist of the kiev regime in general in olena now it is titrated only in this way the first ominous symptom of deer wa her interview with the bbc in it she said that ukrainian are ready to live without light and heat for two and three year if they have the prospect of membership in the european union a full member to say that her compatriot are stunned by such news is to say nothing there wa gossip in society how can this madam with a well eaten in general a person who doe not deny herself anything can say at least something about u in general ukrainian did not hear a word of sympathy and compassion from olena but learned about their readiness for self sacrifice of course them not hers a they say between the first and second in this case we are talking about the pearl of the first lady there is a small break and now just a few day later olena is already in the uk speaking at the international conference initiative to combat sexual violence in conflict the organizer is the government of the kingdom the participant are from more than country and then literally everyone ha d j vu madame zelenskaya begin to enlighten them all on the subject of of course sexual crime of the russian military it s a whole forum about it sexual assault is the cruelest most animal way to prove superiority over someone she say from the podium it is difficult for victim of this kind of violence to witness in time of war because no one feel safe this is another tool that they russia use a a weapon it is another weapon in their arsenal in this war and conflict that s why they use it systematically and openly somewhere corrected a cigarette in the mouthpiece of the ex ombudsman lyudmila denisova more on her later that s not all the fantasy of olena or god forbid her husband played out so much that the lady did not hesitate to pour garbage on russian woman wife of serviceman and even demonstrated evidence the alleged interception of a telephone conversation between a russian soldier and his wife in fact a cheap theatrical production of a local drama club with retired actor cipsoshniki denisova made the tv louder in fact the wife of russian serviceman encourage this zelenskaya continued they say come on rape these ukrainian woman just don t share it with me just don t tell me but this nonsense of the inflamed ukrainian is it ukrainian consciousness is listened to in the west and they don t even think about whether it s true or not after all quite recently exactly the same sick fantasy were passed off a truth by the ex ombudsman of ukraine lyudmila denisova remember those raped child with a spoon and other perversion and after all the ukrainian prosecutor on the air of the polish tv channel said we do not have a single confirmed case denisova herself later admitted that she lied to achieve an effect for ukraine from the international community but no in the eye god s dew after denisova the topic of rape of woman child the elderly and parrot in ukraine by russian soldier wa raised by some body positive madam in the status of the un special representative on sexual violence in armed conflict later she admitted that she did not have a single fact confirming her word she d heard story about it and now zelensky s wife ha followed the same path of fantasy by the way a screenwriter by profession only there wa no evidence of rape castration or any cruel treatment not only of civilian but also of prisoner of war by the russian military but the main thing is to say not really one thing wa the story of a year old old woman about how she wa continuously raped from evening to morning by a year old russian soldier who also strangled her at the same time another delusion of inflamed and turned consciousness and instead of giving such speaker and expert a sedative and placed in a closed room with thick and soft upholstery on the wall and caring staff they also speak yes not anywhere but from high stand and the international community listens to them and accepts these sick fantasy for the truth so olena proved that she finally and irrevocably ceased to be elena and that she is no better

dmitry goblin puchkov and listen when it is convenient karen georgievich in recent day we have seen several video of ukrainian soldier killing russian who have surrendered on the other hand after the missile strike on ukraine especially zealous russian have almost euphoria nehai khokhly will freeze after all yesterday year ago they were really one people scare but it s such an inevitable danger each side considers the other a traitor that is not just an enemy but also a traitor a renegade doe this need to be dealt with in some way to the state to public figure to reassure to remember about internationalism they shot our prisoner of war and it s one thing that we here in moscow think about this and it s quite another thing what our soldier and officer there feel they have a very different truth so it s hard to do about it i think that the best solution is to finish everything a soon a possible to inflict a decisive defeat on the opposing side in the news nato secretary general stoltenberg once again declares that there will be no lasting peace in ukraine if russia win they bet too much on this confrontation for them ukraine s defeat is also their defeat and it is their strategic mistake to turn the conflict into such a fundamental one for themselves for them but the same go for u for u defeat is also fraught with the most serious consequence and it could have been different they could not turn this conflict into such an existential one for themselves that is raising the question of existence itself but we decided to go all in so for them ukraine s defeat is their defeat followed by a weakening of their influence this will prove that the western world is not able to control the situation on the planet and this physical thought is followed by purely economic consequence when akella miss the pack will not follow him and that s a crash a law banning gay propaganda wa passed do you think it s appropriate it s funny that the issue of fighting gay ha become such a world issue to a certain extent it can cause some internal rupture in our country among different group of the population therefore we must treat it very carefully but indeed this gay story ha become somewhat maniacal in the west almost the most important topic of the modern world a an old marxist i look at this a part of bourgeois culture looking for class interest i think that such unrestrained propaganda of this topic is connected with the desire of the modern bourgeoisie to distract the proletariat and the toiling peasantry from the true problem of mankind and our bourgeois parliament adopted a ban the paradox is that we fighting with the west say that we have no ideology but it s there and in fact it is bourgeois liberal that is the same a that of the west and our current ally are left wing communist movement a in soviet time yes but then everything wa clear the ussr is an ideological antipode not today so you are right our bourgeois elite is forced to go to such a conflict if from the point of view of the idea we are complete like minded people then there is such a fight around and we are talking about the place that we occupy in the hierarchy the west doesn t like that we want a special place so we entered their world in adopted an ideology a system of value and then said we want to sit at the same table with you and they don t want to by the way i think this is our problem with ukraine we do not offer them any other ideology view of the world social order and they say it s better then to do the same thing but with the west not with you this is a very difficult situation for u but in the west they believe that we have the wrong capitalism but we don t think so the people themselves chose it now they say we were deceived but to this i will say guy you had to think with your head they threw everything away it had it own ideology china did not throw it away and continues to do so they have communist vietnam and other country have the same thing yes today we say that this is yeltsin he wa bad we do not want to and what difference doe it make to the west you came to u you said that you will be just like u you will profess our value so you re going to do what you re told but our ally are all the same left wing country cuba china vietnam india that s the paradox now it turned out that they were the only one who still have some kind of friendly disposition with u bring back socialism that is well something need to change i m a socialist i understand that it is impossible to return to the form of soviet socialism but it can have different form everyone around u including the former soviet republic is now looking at the u fight with russia which challenged the world hegemon but the influence of the hegemon is not only in military and economic power but also in cultural we abandoned ideology the soviet had many problem but it wa attractive all over the world i went abroad i wa quite skeptical but in latin america for example ordinary people came up touched me and said lord you are a soviet man you are from lenin s homeland and influence is ally you are so nostalgic for the soviet union i love it he wa the pinnacle of russian civilization in general because non western civilization ha begun to overtake the west in technology this ha never happened in year space nuclear energy you can talk a lot and all this wa of course largely due to education and culture at the same time i do not deny that there were a lot of stupidity in the ussr a lot of thing that needed to be corrected when the special operation began all sort of incorrigible optimist began to say that this is an absolutely incredible process the world economy will change the culture will begin to change new people will come etc nine month have already passed you see at least some tangible sign of a new world not yet but this process is just beginning any revolutionary process it s not just took the winter and behold they sometimes take decade to pa how doe it happen after the great patriotic war the military generation came to cinema literature painting young people with front line experience they turned everything upside down i suppose that out of the hundred of thousand of soldier who are now at the front there should be great director writer and painter but i don t understand how they can get through here i also suspect that people are maturing on the battlefield who will have a huge impact on our country in the future i suspect that in military affair there have already appeared such it wa during such period that the napoleon emerged but there are two way either the authority will carry out this process from above or cataclysm may occur when these several hundred thousand soldier who have passed the front will not be satisfied with the situation in which they find themselves guy thank you very much andrei turchak hesitated a little it s hard to overstate what you re doing if on one side of the sheet you note the labor cost of creating your reconnaissance unit and on the other the number of destroyed target weapon and equipment it s not comparable i understand intelligence love silence but someday everyone will know what you re doing here and how these word were uttered by the secretary of the general council of united russia in the twilight of a concrete bunker instead of a table there are box of shell around people in camouflage until recently they wore expensive suit and sat in deputy chair not only in the state duma but also in the parliament of city and region and now they are volunteer they are fighting in a specially created unit in the special operation zone not much is known about this squad no one would have known about it at all if the first deputy head of the presidential

the entire deputy detachment deputy chairman of the state duma defense committee dmitry sablin told turchak that there were a few day left to study sablin wa commanded by god himself to command the deputy squadron he is a reserve colonel born in mariupol and the idea to gather volunteer deputy in one combat cell belongs to him what exactly the people s representative are doing on the front line is not disclosed i wa able to contact sablin among other thing i tried to clarify this we are carrying out reconnaissance task wa the reply that s it period and here are sablin s word we are very worried about the mobilized guy and understand that their life depend on the quality of our work therefore we try to protect the equipment and at the same time we work we give our best guy sometimes

badma bashankaev is a surgeon at the front he work in a military hospital the chairman of the union of volunteer of donbas mp alexander borodai head several detachment in the dpr at once and deputy vitaly milonov serf a an artilleryman in horlivka in the donbas he received the call sign gustav enlisted in the calculation of the mt rapira anti tank gun this is a jewelry tool that can hit directly in the eye so a not to spoil the skin milonov said every day we destroy several target and provide our motorized rifleman attack aircraft with the opportunity to move forward at least meter recently the whole of mayorsk wa laid out hopefully we can implement a larger offensive the main thing is that ammunition should be in abundance and it doesn t rust behind u most people here don t know we re serving nearby the commander of the deputy detachment dmitry sablin through his assistant answered several question from komsomolka what kind of mp entered the cascade subdivision state duma deputy serve in it mainly from united russia and regional parliament a well a experienced fighter and volunteer from the combat brotherhood and our youth from the young guard in what condition do deputy live

that ha tap water in it location the rest can only envy how other fighter treat you it s okay to treat those who don t talk but clearly do their job well treated most do not know that deputy serve next to them we don t advertise it including for security reason like the mood in the squad when it is possible to give a result the mood is good did you have to use official position to improve the delivery of equipment and equipment to the front i do not know what it mean in this case to use official position but we and many other deputy from the first day helped civilian and our army and the people s militia of the dpr lpr especially now when people serve side by side eat from the same cauldron is there any evidence that the armed force of ukraine are hunting for volunteer mp we do not advertise the presence of deputy here including in order not to expose those who are fighting nearby to additional risk having gone to the front the deputy do not abandon political activity on the social network of some of them there are report of event in their constituency there were even negative comment about it for example when vitaly milonov wa seen in the kremlin that s right i wa obliged to attend the signing ceremony of agreement on the entry of new region into russia the deputy explained the commander of the deputy unit dmitry sablin explained such a part time job of course we try to monitor what is happening in the district where people have entrusted u with mandate a large load on our team assistant who continue to work and sometimes these problem can be monitored

the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want we are trying to fight not by number but by skill we are trying to follow the testament of generalissimo suvorov including in the zone of special operation former deputy prime minister and former head of roscosmos dmitry rogozin recently said that in the near future our troop on the front of the svo will begin to receive those best and newest sample produced by our military industrial complex which have not yet been used and which will unpleasantly surprise the enemy that s a good thing of course but it should be noted that by mid november our troop had already used a lot of modern weapon system during the svo they not only showed themselves magnificently in a real combat situation but also allowed u to save a lot of life of our fighter during attacking and defensive action a well a without painful loss for personnel to hit the painful point of the enemy only in the first day of november and only in the sky of the donetsk people s republic about missile of american highmars mlrs were destroyed by russian air defense combat crew the greatest effectiveness in the fight against drone and multiple launch rocket system of the enemy according to the commander of the ground force of the armed force of the russian federation oleg salyukov show the s v b air defense system the buk mz m and tor m m u m dt air defense system the fighter attack aircraft and helicopter remaining with the ukrainian air force also come under crushing fire from both anti aircraft missile system and our aviation when it is necessary to deal with suddenly appearing air target at extremely low altitude our fighter turn to the igla and verba manpad general salyukov emphasized with their help a significant part of the manned aviation of the armed force of ukraine wa eliminated the most striking of the latest example wa the work in october of the s v complex which destroyed two ukrainian dryer the su and su which were heading to attack target in the belgorod region were destroyed by this modern and very long range wax air defense system at a range of more than kilometer military expert note that the control system of air defense troop created on the basis of automated weapon control mean polyana d m and barnaul t from the esu tk confirmed it effectiveness and the ability to control the force and mean of air defense in real time both new and proven arstystems showed themselves in the svo zone for example the mm howitzer msta b work in detail is known in all sector of the front our gun is the most accurate say the gunner sergeant in the southern section it s like a sniper rifle for u gunner when working with it you need to do everything carefully set the guidance clearly and the most important thing is not to make mistake in calculation the calculation of the msta b which is capable of aiming at a range of almost kilometer and can fire up to shell per minute and in november continues to destroy foreign sample of weapon and equipment supplied to the armed force of ukraine both in the zaporozhye direction and in the dpr high explosive high explosive fragmentation a well a high precision ammunition are used defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov said this allows you to inflict maximum damage to fortification buried concrete fortification armored vehicle and enemy manpower at a considerable distance and on november the stronghold of the armed force of ukraine near ugledar were eliminated by fire from the msta s and acacia self propelled gun the maximum damage wa inflicted on the nd separate mechanized brigade of the armed force of ukraine and the th brigade of territorial defense of the armed force of ukraine according to which our gunner worked with aim during the loading of personnel and equipment since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november russian troop killed about more mercenary of the foreign legion in the dpr six armored vehicle were also hit the russian defense ministry reported that air defense system intercepted an excalibur guided projectile in the sumy region also the air defense force managed to shoot down two rocket of the himars multiple launch rocket system in the area of the village of bogdanovka kherson region russian troop destroyed a warehouse with ammunition for mlrs himars in the area of dnepropetrovsk it stored more than shell noted in the russian ministry of defense the armed force of ukraine shelled peaceful neighborhood of donetsk there are wounded at least three people were injured a video of the consequence of the strike of the armed force of ukraine on donetsk appeared on the web shell hit apartment building russian intelligence officer intercepted and landed the drone of the armed force of ukraine furia the drone wa landed using an electronic warfare system during the shelling of the armed force of ukraine in donetsk foreign journalist jonny miller wa almost killed russian troop thwarted the attack of the armed force of ukraine in the krasnolimansky direction ukrainian troop lost more than serviceman increasingly frigid winter weather presented new challenge for ukraine on sunday a mud churned up the battlefield and snowfall made the government s task of restoring power supply devastated by week of russian bombing all the more urgent the state energy company ukrenergo said that there wa enough electricity to cover percent of the country s consumption need because nuclear power station disconnected from the national grid by russian attack last week had been brought back online but it urged ukrainian to continue to use electricity sparingly to avoid overwhelming a national grid that ha been weakened by repeated barrage of russian cruise missile and drone if consumption increase in the evening the number of outage may increase president volodymyr zelensky said in his nightly address late saturday this once again show how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally the plea highlighted the growing concern in ukraine and among it ally that even a it force gain ground on the battlefield the onset of winter will bring new difficulty muddy cold condition could slow the progress of ukrainian troop trying to recapture territory in the east and south although they will also challenge the russian at the same time russia s strategy of attacking ukrainian infrastructure from the air could make life miserable for civilian far from the front line and add to pressure on mr zelensky s government ukraine s ally whose military hardware ha helped shift the momentum in the war are accelerating their effort to help kyiv prepare for more disruption to it power supply the european union announced over the weekend that it would deliver to ukraine generator each capable of powering a hospital a well a transformer according to a statement by the european commission s president ursula von der leyen the united state said it ha also provided generator and canada said it had allocated money for the same purpose for some ukrainian the switch to generator power carried it own risk the chief of police of the kyiv region andriy nebytov said that in the village of bobrytsia a man died and his wife wa hospitalized because of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator placed in their living room he said that in another village in the region hostomel four member of one family including a year old girl were also hospitalized because of carbon monoxide poisoning moscow ha escalated it attack on ukraine s energy system over the past several week a it troop have been forced to retreat from territory they had seized across a broad front from the city of izium in the northeast to kherson hundred of mile away in the south since ukraine reclaimed the city of kherson nov neither side ha recorded significant advance on the battlefield the overall pace of operation along the frontline ha slowed in recent day due to deteriorating weather condition said a report late on saturday by the institute for the study of war research institute but military analyst say that another perhaps more significant factor is that ukraine s advance ha pushed the invading russian force to the eastern side of the dnipro river which bisects ukraine and now provides a natural barrier in eastern ukraine both side have established stronger defensive position and dug trench to provide cover from the intense artillery fire of frequent battle serhiy haidai the head of the military administration in the luhansk region in the east said in a post on telegram on sunday every liberated meter of the luhansk region is very very hard analyst say that while fighting is unlikely to stop for winter the weather will make it harder for both army to maintain troop in the field in the eastern city of bakhmut which russian force have pummeled for month but failed to capture resident have taken to cutting down tree and foliage to burn for warmth it utility having been destroyed by unrelenting attack the ground not yet frozen ha turned to mud sticking to uniform and weapon and ensnaring vehicle military and civilian alike analyst said that cold can affect morale and that mud will present a particular obstacle for vehicle over the next few week before the ground freeze in such condition the supply of western support to ukraine s military which ha included winter clothing could help keep troop warm and give them an advantage not least over newly mobilized russian soldier just arriving on the battlefield still russia ha continued to bombard ukrainian town and village with the authority in at least five ukrainian region reporting attack on sunday kyrylo tymoshenko a senior official in mr zelensky s office said that seven people had been killed since saturday and others wounded because of russian attack or explosion caused by land mine planted by moscow s force kherson ha been hit particularly hard since russian force retreated this month from the regional capital to the eastern side of the dnipro and set up a defensive position from which they have continued to fire upon ukrainian soldier and civilian yaroslav yanushevych head of the kherson regional military administration said on telegram on sunday that russia had shelled the region from across the river time since saturday one person wa killed and a girl wa wounded in an attack overnight he said russia wa using terror tactic deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure and civilian he said in a separate post he added that russian artillery had again hit the city s power line on sunday valentyn reznichenko head of the military administration in the central region of dnipropetrovsk said on telegram that russia had fired grad rocket and heavy artillery at the district of nikopol from position in enerhodar a city close to the embattled zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant resident in nikopol were terrorized by the attack he said although nobody wa injured bakhmut ukraine for almost an hour the stream of ukrainian casualty in the eastern city of bakhmut seemed unending ambulance an armored personnel carrier and private vehicle all screamed to a halt one after another and disgorged the wounded in front of the city s only military hospital a soldier propped up by his comrade his face a mass of mangled flesh walked in the main gate the dark green stretcher that awaited him wa one of several still covered in blood by around noon on friday doctor had counted wounded many of them soldier the day before wa even worse people had come through the hospital s door with everything from gunshot wound to shrapnel injury and concussion they came in batch five said parus one of the ukrainian medic at the hospital a artillery screeched overhead and the chatter of machine gun fire echoed off the surrounding building in the last couple of day the russian have tried to advance more intensely in the nine month since russia invaded ukraine ha celebrated major victory breaking the siege of it capital kyiv and pushing russian force out of the kharkiv region and the port city of kherson but bakhmut in ukraine s donbas region ha become a destructive vortex for both country military for month they have thrown mass of troop and mat riel into battle here a the russian mount desperate attempt to capture the city and the ukrainian to hold it the result have been near catastrophic the city once with a population of around ha slowly been chewed apart and now according to resident and ukrainian soldier the bombardment in and around bakhmut is at an intensity never before seen building that had been shelled before have been shelled again the front line on the city s outskirt look like a muddy moonscape or a scene from world war i at night resident can hear the grumble of russian jet prowling the sky in recent day ukraine ha sent flood of reinforcement into bakhmut including special force and lesser trained territorial defense fighter according to soldier local resident and a u s defense official the russian have continued to throw formation from wagner group an infamous paramilitary organization with direct tie to the kremlin at ukrainian trench but they are now supported by a new tranche of russian rank and file force redeployed from the kherson front according to the u s defense official and ukrainian soldier the intensity of russia s attempt to seize the city ha baffled military analyst elsewhere along their mile front line the russian are mostly digging in for winter to entrench and conserve resource in summer after russian force captured the neighboring province of luhansk seizing bakhmut might have looked like a natural progression in russia s campaign to conquer the east a step toward two more important city sloviansk and kramatorsk but now analyst said given the degradation of russian force and their ammunition shortage after a series of setback that goal seems improbable especially after the loss of their foothold in the northeast the russian military is still dealing with unrealistic political demand to show progress said michael kofman the director of russian study at c n a a research institute in arlington va but given poor quality of available force and decreasing stock of artillery ammunition they are unlikely to be successful because once again the russian military appears to be feeding unit piecemeal without adequate support in recent week moscow s need for any type of military victory ha made itself felt in pocket elsewhere along the front line small village near the russian controlled city of donetsk have turned into flash point but a the temperature plummet bakhmut ha quickly evolved into moscow s main effort where mass of their force including recently mobilized troop according to ukrainian soldier are trying to strangle the city from the east and south russia s strategy in bakhmut is reminiscent of it seizure of the eastern city of sievierodonetsk and lysychansk in june there russian troop relied on superior artillery fire to overpower ukrainian force and gain ground but the ukrainian force they faced then were short of both shell and western supplied artillery something that is no longer a pressing especially in bakhmut in the six month that i ve been in bakhmut i have never seen our artillery working like this said a ukrainian soldier in the city referring to the volume of ukrainian shell fired he spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wa not authorized to speak to the medium but at this point in the war both army may find the pace of bombardment hard to sustain the russian are reportedly trying to buy munition from north korea and iran and ukraine continues to ask for more artillery shell from nato and other donor country even though those nation stockpile are dwindling one of the pentagon s frequent concern is that the ukrainian are firing ammunition at an unsustainable rate especially in place like bakhmut under the false assumption that the west s supply of ordnance is unlimited said the u s defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discus sensitive information a bakhmut shelled continually by the russian since july devolves into a battle of attrition it strategic significance ha changed too even if russia s hope of expanding it territory here have dwindled it can still make the city a resource intensive black hole for kyiv taking troop from other ukrainian priority potentially including future offensive battle like bakhmut consume force that could be used elsewhere mr kofman said adding that russian force are using people they deem expendable but even so they cannot afford to waste that much artillery the ukrainian force holding bakhmut are from a hodgepodge of unit including the rd mechanized brigade and the th motorized infantry brigade crack unit that have been worn down by nonstop russian assault troop from other brigade have arrived in recent week to plug hole in the line and shore up formation floundering after heavy casualty but even though the number of ukrainian wounded and dead are steep the attacking russian are suffering far worse ukrainian soldier say a their exposed assault are cut down by artillery and machine gun fire u s defense official estimate that russia and ukraine have each suffered around wounded and dead over the course of the war though those number are impossible to verify the casualty number in bakhmut even more so colder temperature and muddy trench are also causing injury on both side pro russian military blogger have complained about a lack of cold weather clothing especially among recently mobilized force and doctor at the bakhmut hospital said hypothermia and trench foot a painful skin condition caused by prolonged immersion in cold water were common among ukrainian force though treated quickly and often at the front line the soldier are getting everything they need thermal underwear winter coat everything but it doe not fix everything said ihor a doctor at the hospital who like others gave only his first name for security reason under the rain for two three day in the trench you understand on friday ukrainian soldier who had recently come off the line huddled in front of the hospital their face uniform and weapon covered in splotchy mud their trouser soaked from the recent rain medic from the th brigade flinched a an incoming artillery round struck nearby but barely reacted a a second shell came so close that it cracked and shattered nearby window they were intent on moving their patient much of the city s eastern reach around a once acclaimed winery is a gray zone between russian and ukrainian position to it south the village of optyne is heavily contested the mobilized russian troop are just taking a rifle and walking right down like in soviet time said another ukrainian medic going by the call sign smile he get killed and the next one come up the same way recent battlefield advance around bakhmut have been measured in yard not mile every day is a kaleidoscope of russian and ukrainian force either pushing forward or retreating often resulting in minimal gain at a bloody cost on friday one ukrainian soldier said his unit wa retreating when he wa blown off his foot by a mortar while another unit elsewhere in bakhmut wa assaulting a russian position ayrat a soldier from the st brigade wa pushing toward a russian trench when he wa wounded in both leg by a grenade either dropped by a drone or fired by a russian grenade launcher we went for an assault he said speaking hoarsely in a dimly lit hospital hall and wrapped in a foil survival blanket his unit had approached where russian were entrenched my comrade are alive he said wincing through the pain do you have a cigarette on sunday november when it wa already night in transbaikalia my new hero

to choose taxpayer from new region can find out on the updated promotional page of the federal tax service since february the russian armed force have been conducting a military special operation in ukraine to protect the donbas a well a to denazify and demilitarize the country the kp ru website publishes the latest news online about russia s military special operation in ukraine on november the lpr reported that the brigade of the armed force of ukraine near svatovo and kremennaya consist almost entirely of mercenary it is noted that the reason for such personnel decision were large loss in the rank of the ukrainian army the mayor of horlivka prikhodko said that the armed force of ukraine shelled the church of st andrew the first called two direct hit to the temple are reported the russian military repelled the attack of the armed force of ukraine in the donetsk direction in the area of three settlement the russian military destroyed the himars mlrs ammunition depot this wa reported in the ministry of defense of the russian federation an air alert wa announced in several region of ukraine on november this is evidenced by the data of the online map of the ministry of digitalization of the country in the lpr the tanker survived in a knocked out tank and continued to serve during a special operation ukrainian journalist continue to demonstrate the mass death of reason on the front of the fight against russian aggression on november anti aircraft gunner of the fire support company of the th separate battalion of the nd brigade of the territorial defense of the armed force of ukraine in the odessa region noticed a russian missile in the sky and opened fire from a large caliber dshkm machine gun said in a statement rbc ukraine a a result of the firing the russian s missile wa shot down that s serious right no we know that the ukrainian command and authority say whenever their air defense are triggered abnormally and slap on their own home often also with resident that it is the russian who have run out of kalibr missile so they shoot at ukrainian target with s pvs missile but that a rocket flying at a speed of meter per second or even a little more can be shot down from the dshk is this serious it is clear that for ukraine where drone shoot down housewife with can of homemade pickle and some grandfather even landed a su with a shot from a bandera cut any possible fantasy is considered a reality but at least some semblance of plausibility tried to preserve even the most famous liar in the world baron carl jerome in general you understood that we are talking about munchausen true this wa before the emergence of ukraine and now the baron would hang himself from envy and a sense of his own worthlessness missile defense wa strengthened by an anti missile kulemet a machine gun if anyone doe not know in ukrainian ukrovoeny especially from territorial defense even subsonic kalibr are escorted opening their mouth and here the s is on supersonic you wouldn t even have time to see it and where by the way did the russian s come from near odessa if they fly at ground target at most for kilometer and then when very lucky where wa this russian s launched in this case on what part of the front did the russian troop come to a distance of forty kilometer to odessa why are both general staff silent on this issue apparently if any such fact took place it wa only in this version of what happened ukrainian air defense fired the s probably targeting some object in the sky the missile went abnormally but in this case fortunately the self liquidator worked or they could have been sent to romania according to the polish scenario the theroboronians who saw this toast recorded this on their combat account kind of like those junior high school student who used pea gun to help the elusive avenger in a movie theater and after catching up with the school principal they agreed that healthy they helped the elusive and what can you do the country need hero and in the dreamer of high in ukrainian here on ukrainian television the secretary of the lviv city council markiyan lopachak promised to put up for auction the moscow kremlin when ukraine receives ownership of moscow s property he still ha of lviv s population without electricity and he dream of selling the kremlin or is it a necessary condition to repair the energy system with the proceeds from the sale of the kremlin and give light to lviv resident first the money then the repair money in the morning chair in the evening well then another thing let them sit in the dark for now a zelensky s wife put it two and three year the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want it turn out that the creation of our legendary missile fighter and even rifle wa accompanied by such drama and intrigue that they were ready to go under the knife and now we re proud of them here u s secretary of defense lloyd austin dropped a fat compliment in our direction the russian have impressive weapon and this happens extremely rarely with jealous american in uniform and without although it wa said through the teeth but on that thank you and the truth is that we have a lot of unique military equipment moreover not only generously advertised on the lacquered page of advertising magazine but tested in battle both in syria and in the special operation in ukraine but what is curious the fate of some weapon hung in the balance and even those that we are proud of today well how it wa slitban mask back in the spring american billionaire elon musk planted a fat space pig on u he made his starlink satellite communication system plow for u intelligence and the ukrainian army they began to receive data online for pointing drone missile and gun at russian position in ukraine and then suddenly there wa a breakdown starlink stopped furying over those area of ukraine where there wa active fighting kiev general shouted they say this is either a mistake of the pentagon or musk switched to the side of moscow deliberately dropped the network to help russia one of them admitted starlink is our oxygen if musk leaf our army will be in chaos ukrainian specialist started talking about incomprehensible mass problem not only with the internet but also with military communication a soon a the signal from starlink satellite began to disappear the ukrainian stopped receiving important intelligence and sharply reduced the number of their attack and those troop of ukraine who were left without communication and the field internet began to suffer heavy loss musk himself also shed a tear he admitted that starlink s work in ukraine is under threat and here s the attention it turn out that these are russian electronic warfare electronic warfare system actively trying to kill starlink and they can finally break this system the name of the pest that turned off musk s satellite over the special operation zone is already known this is the russian ew complex tirada s it wa created to jam enemy communication satellite he is helped by a system that warns of a missile attack having received data from her tirada jam musk s satellite with pulse of the desired frequency the result is that the connection between space and ground terminal is cut off after that the multi star british general michael wigston said that in the future due to the stunning development of russian electronic warfare not only the american starlink and it english colleague oneweb would work poorly the general wa wrong in his prediction the future ha already come although the year history of the creation of tirade is complex and dramatic there were period when the design work on the project lost it pulse there wa no money there were scientific and technological dead end and customer have already preferred a different system but the specialist of the moscow research radio engineering institute and progress jsc were able to save defend and bring it to mind vladislav korolev a member of the project told me tirada s is capable of interrupting any satellite communication within a radius of ten of kilometer completely making the spacecraft inactive it main weapon is a narrow beam aimed at the frequency of the satellite communication channel and creating special interference that interferes with the transmission of the signal to the addressee no matter how incredible noise immunity the satellite ha it will still spend all it energy on desperate attempt to break through the electromagnetic curtain but he will not be able to bypass the tirade victorious doubt in no le dramatic scientific and technical torment our laser gun peresvet wa born which today is also on the battlefield how many time did the highbrow luminary sentence him to death russian academician yevgeny alexandrov stated that theoretically such a laser could be created but subject to the use of very difficult and cumbersome solution he doubted that it would be possible to make and even more so to adopt the peresvet other prominent scientist also gave in to him they say the creation of this laser gun is a waste of brain time and money you can t fool the law of physic such installation consume too much energy so it is unlikely to use them a an effective portable tool and yet it worked according to yuri borisov the former deputy prime minister who oversaw the defense industry peresvet can blind all satellite reconnaissance system of the enemy in orbit up to kilometer the resurrected heir of oki but in the history of the creation of domestic weapon there are many sad example when unique sample were still lost this happened both for political and economic reason and sometimes because of the adventurous stupidity of some leader which bordered on betrayal but it wa all presented a new thinking remember those favorite word of mikhail gorbachev and under boris yeltsin many gap in the country s defense were broken we abandoned the buran space shuttle from combat railway missile system from heavy aircraft carrying cruiser having allowed them to be sold behind the cordon out of in the navy rank were left mikhail sergeevich at the insistent request of the united state ordered to put under pressure the otr oka operational tactical missile system launcher of this complex were blown up the technological line wa also dismantled and even the equipment for the production of oka wa destroyed but thank god the school of the brilliant designer sergey invincible ha been preserved another time came and his student created an even more effective missile system now everyone know him a the famous iskander he s also at the front today on his combat account dozen of headquarters and ammunition depot of the enemy destroyed by high precision strike i myself witnessed how during the test from a distance of km the missile of this complex hit the peg the american press call the iskander the most dangerous after nuclear weapon of russia and ukrainian general complain that the iskander missile is extremely difficult to intercept even with the help of modern missile defense system sent to kiev by nato country american bandwagon the fate of our newest already overgrown with legend hypersonic complex dagger wa very difficult by the way on march during a special operation his debut took place the first combat use a kinzhala missile sniped a large repository of ukrainian and foreign missile hidden deep in a mine ivano frankivsk region a you know the dagger is attached to the belly of the mig fighter back in the second half of the s the installation batch of this combat vehicle wa built at the sokol plant in nizhny novgorod there it gathered dust until march when it wa shown to the military political leadership of russia the leadership clapped their hand and approved further test of the fighter which continued until the spring of then mikoyan s okb reported to the kremlin on the successful completion of the test and in response received a telegram from yeltsin congratulating both the firm itself and it subcontractor everyone wa waiting for the plane to go into production but russia of the mid s such an aircraft wa not needed production of the mig wa stopped in addition the share of the perm motor plant pmz which created engine for it ended up in the hand of the american and the plant stopped the production of such power plant why the american wagged their tail they say there are no unique engine of increased power d f but that wa a lie the commission that arrived from moscow scraped it down and found out that the plant and it storage base had such engine this made it possible to ensure the production of at least migs which wa done little by little the mig began to appear in combat formation looking at their high characteristic the golden head of our defense industry proposed to combine the hypersonic dagger with the aircraft into one complex although to cross a ballistic missile and an air launch is a very difficult engineering task but it wa solved and the fighter became a kind of acceleration platform for the missile moreover the new missile did not need to be invented the iskander wa taken a a basis it of course wa modernized they achieved a range of destruction thousand kilometer and a speed of up to thousand km h a possible deviation from the center of the target is only meter moreover the warhead is controlled throughout the flight path using aerodynamic rudder and shunting micromotors therefore a rocket that make unpredictable maneuver in flight is difficult to hit dagger is the most common missile but it cannot be shot down u president joe biden once said about our miracle weapon and this amused even those who have long been accustomed to the ridiculous statement of the head of the white house putin s long sword the russian kalibr cruise missile ha already become a real hit especially now when it is super successfully used in a special operation in ukraine calibrating the enemy is almost the most fashionable expression now in the troop back in when russia first used kalibr in syria western expert were shocked by their accuracy the circular deviation from target which are kilometer from the launch site wa no more than meter for this reason abroad the missile wa nicknamed putin s long sword but in the history of the creation of this formidable weapon there wa a moment when it development wa slowed down ukrainian competitor from the zaporozhye plant motor sich they produced rocket engine time passed and the heart of the rocket remained on paper and it remains to be seen how many year it would have remained there if the people from the rybinsk saturn plant had not taken up the cause here s how it former director yuri lastochkin told about it it wa clear to u that sooner or later russia would need it own rocket engine chance helped in putin came to the saturn and i reported to him that we were ready but the matter wa slowed down by the ordering missile department of our ministry of defense to which putin replied briefly and with a smile address turnout let s get wet i thought he wa joking but by the way the face of the retinue the then profile deputy prime minister klebanov and the head of roscosmos koptev changed it became clear that the result would be and so it happened thing have gotten off the ground feature of the kalibr missile not only in a powerful engine or in a mighty kg warhead but also in a unique navigation system in built in mean of countering enemy air defense caliber doe not fly in a straight trajectory but change it depending on the terrain and the observed enemy anti aircraft system if the kalibr electronics detect the radiation of someone else s air defense or electronic warfare the missile instantly change the trajectory and rebuilds the flight route gloomy is a nugget not so long ago a unique weapon appeared in our troop fighting in ukraine the sumrak sniper rifle today it is considered the best in the world first of all according to the main indicator accuracy and firing range meter and they made a rifle about year ago not in some cool weapon company but at a private enterprise design bureau of integrated system it is in tarusa in the kaluga region it owner is a russian gun nugget

wa not renewed the license for sniper rifle there are rumor that these were the trick of competitor lobaev did not bang his head against the wall and with all his team and equipment moved to the united arab emirate and there i continued to develop the rifle he created are in service with the royal guard and elite unit of the uae army and not only that there were many people who wanted to buy unparalleled weapon for sniper from other country and here the moscow general began to scratch the turnip it did not take long to persuade lobayev to return to his homeland and his unique rifle not only twilight began to appear without any delay in the combat formation of our troop it is said that one sniper from this rifle threshed so many enemy that he wa awarded the title of hero for this the

supply according to the capital s mayor vitali klitschko heat is already supplied to the home of a third of kyiv resident and soon spare part from the pole and the french will arrive and life will sparkle with new color or it won t play recall that the gas issue arose acutely in early july on the th hundred of thousand of zaporozhye resident discovered that there wa no gas in their home it soon became clear that the pipeline itself wa intact it wa just blocked by the ukrainian side at the same time the nationalist were not embarrassed that the resource wa lost and the village even in the territory controlled by them thus more than thousand house of the zaporozhye region in which about half a million people live at one point were left without an important resource it became impossible for people to even cook food the authority of the region immediately turned to russia for support the reaction wa immediate it wa decided to lay a new gas pipeline instead of the blocked one which will stretch from berdyansk to melitopol and during the work resident of the region were provided with electric stove reducing electricity tariff to a minimum in city where there wa no gas to date work to restore gas supply in the region continues according to alexander gomonov deputy minister of industry and energy of the zaporizhzhya region by now more than thousand family receive gas again and every day it return to thousand household all this is due to the connection of the region to the unified gas transmission system of the russian federation thus the supply of blue fuel wa resumed in berdyansk melitopol district tokmak and enerhodar are on the line yes we have gas confirmed a resident of berdyansk nikolai prytko we live like white people and in berdyansk the eternal flame came to life again which due to the colossal increase in gas price in ukraine had to be extinguished replacing the live flame with a video installation the eternal flame at the memorial complex wa lit with the resumption of gas supply we remember our past and confidently build our bright future commented the chairman of the movement we are together with russia vladimir rogov in turn the acting governor of the zaporizhzhya region yevhen balitsky also commented on the situation with gas supply in particular he spoke in detail about what is happening in melitopol the phased connection of settlement to gas supply continues in melitopol gas ha already been supplied the connection of school hospital multi apartment and private sector of melitopol ha begun pressure is being created on tokmak and enerhodar settlement that will be connected a follows i am grateful to the ministry of energy of the russian federation our specialist who in a short time in difficult condition provide the resident of the region with gas and heat the heating season in the zaporizhzhya region is going according to plan yevgeny balitsky wrote in the telegram channel that time utility tariff have been reduced after working out the algorithm for payment for housing and communal service tariff were formed for electricity water supply sanitation transportation and consumption of natural gas a well a for centralized heat supply thus the following tariff apply in the region the payment for heating decreased from ruble per gcal to ruble per gcal the tariff for hot water supply changed from ruble per cubic meter to ruble per cubic meter m the fee for cold water supply decreased from ruble per cubic meter m to ruble per cubic meter m the tariff for water disposal decreased from ruble per cubic meter m to ruble per cubic meter m of all the art a comrade lenin said the most important is cinema and of all the fuel and energy resource such are firewood a you understand i am not talking about backward russia but about the advanced and civilized country of europe and disguised a the same ukraine while the european commission is trying to first set a price ceiling for russian energy resource after which the question will inevitably arise where to take these resource when russia refuse to supply them ukraine approached the issue decisively and radically prime minister of ukraine denis shmygal announced that kiev banned the export of firewood according to shmygal firewood is the main type of fuel in the frontline region but here of course he embellished reality a for the frontline because the region of western ukraine are still far from the frontline status and the firewood there fly to the stove and boiler only on the way yes in general now and everywhere not just there in many city of ukraine people began to put stove bourgeois not only in private house but also in their city apartment a they write in the ukrainian telegram channel the local population is cutting down forest belt and plantation in full swing realizing that they will have to solve the problem with the lack of heat in home on their own but ukrainian should understand that this is still half the way to become full fledged european real european not only harvest buy and sell for the purpose of profit this time more expensive primitive fuel but also steal it this is already happening all the time in germany poland latvia etc in latvia they went the furthest local insurance company have already begun to insure firewood against theft but again the offer is really not for everyone but only for those diligent owner who guessed not to put wood under a public canopy in log but closed them in a room at the entrance to which a lock hang on the door the castle can be anything barn even great grandfather of the time of ochakov and the conquest of the crimea or modern modern with a digital set the main thing is the fact of the presence and performance of the main function the next step in protecting firewood from criminal attack by suspicious element should be to install an alarm system and an alarm button on the woodshed to call the police rapid response team and it s not a joke at all just think some month ago the leadership of ukraine and personally the bloody soldier promised to help europe and guaranteed it the supply of electricity to replace russian carbon resource and now they are begging for the same europe gas oil product and gasoline and diesel generator for the production of electricity by the way most of these generator are not designed for continuous operation for a long time their purpose is to insure for the period when electricity is cut off and it is expensive to produce a kilowatt hour from gasoline or diesel fuel but they are now being imported to ukraine on some cosmic scale according to the deputy of the verkhovna rada of ukraine the head of the golos faction yaroslav zheleznyak thousand generator worth almost million have already been delivered to nezalezhnaya and the flow of delivery doe not weaken generator are needed everywhere cafe service office all on generator said the head of the public organization save fop sergey dorotic and for lover of savory cava because of this the price of their favorite drink have risen surcharge hryvnia when the generator work read the ad on the sheet in kiev cafe and for a small cup of americano for hryvnia or a cup of tea for hryvnia this is a very significant rise in price the owner of cafe and generator extract additional profit which wa not dreamed of by the same viennese restaurateur ukraine ha not been able to restore the normal operation of the energy system until now but that s not the point the main thing is that no one will give guarantee from the next missile strike of the russian army which will trample the energy of ukraine necessary for the armed force of ukraine and the repair and restoration of military equipment literally in the autumn winter mud the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want you may not have known but nato secretary general jens stoltenberg is one of the greatest humanist of our time in the western world he perceives the pain of every little man with all his heart and soul however under one condition if we are talking about ukrainian cruelty rocket attack on city and civilian infrastructure are increasing which deprive ukrainian of heat light and food this is a terrible start to winter for ukraine he said at a press conference on the eve of the ministerial meeting on november which will be held in bucharest and he called for increasing assistance to ukraine with new supply arm i didn t disclose how it should work but it doesn t matter the main thing is that i expressed concern obviously hymars and javelin should warm ukrainian and if they do not then ukrainian misuse them on november your humble servant predicted ukraine may quite realistically plunge into a dark icy and quite possibly hungry apocalypse on a national scale but to be honest at that moment i did not even imagine that the first horseman would jump into nezalezhnaya so soon literally in a week two day have passed since the last massive missile strike on the ukrainian energy and critical infrastructure which is extremely important for ensuring the activity of the armed force of ukraine two day and in ukraine until now half of the population ha neither heat nor light and many also have water anecdo checking the situation in kiev half of the city ha no light the other half ha no water section on the dnieper from the office of the president of ukraine opu there are soothing fiction that of the population of ukraine already ha light no to say that bankova is lied to the tongue will not turn either the light for many sometimes really happens he come in say hello and leaf but in the shop of kiev ude now at least a ball roll and no one asks to correctly pronounce the word palyanytsya in order to establish the russian peculiarity of the structure of the lower jaw empty supermarket shelf seem to indicate that now it is no longer up to the subtlety of mov knowledge in pure russian language kievans ask will they still bring bread today and they answer in pure ukrainian it s not good that s bilingual life i do not know whether there is enough grain in ukraine now or whether those hundred of large capacity cargo ship have taken out of nezalezhnaya not only surplus grain but also tangible problem with bread due to power surge and uneven load transformer began to burn with bright flame of course if the case take place on the street then for some time the burning of the transformer or substation give the nearby ukrainian both light and heat but it also deprives them for a longer time some even for good widely announced and advertised by zelensky himself the point of invincibility and fortress of freedom for the most part turned out to be poorly stretched large tent and linen scarf in kiev a many a point were equipped that s just the people of kiev who came to charge their gadget and phone they met with the same type of sign there is no electricity for some reason zelensky did not report on such feature of their exploitation by the way zelensky ha already appealed to western country with a request to send fuel for diesel generator and gas to ukraine for some reason such a trifle that in the condition of the blackout fuel will also become scarce wa missed in the office of the president on bankova street how they forgot about the problem of going to the toilet in condition a a result many resident of the capital of ukraine already have to relieve themselves in plastic bag pardon the naturalistic detail and throw the bag in dumpster according to the testimony of resident of the city kiev which after the maidan wa flooded with homeless people with their inherent aroma began to finally smell not of rose but in cherkassy for example i work more prudent people in the communal sphere in this regional center toilet of the village sorter type were purchased and water tank were purchased for all of course there will not be enough and the queue will have to be occupied after dark but still and these are the people who until recently condescended russian that there is no urban sewerage in russian village and now not every ukrainian city ha even an elementary rural one but a completely uplifting interview wa given to the bbc by the president s wife olena zelenskaya we know that winter can be another test for u if there is no heat in our home and ukrainian in the majority it wa more than of respondent answered that they are ready to endure this for two three year if they see the prospect of our membership in the eu they want to be in this european family on an equal footing said this lady with a well washed unlike many today s ukrainian head sitting in the warmth with light and clearly not experiencing a shortage of water and other drink a kyyan or kuyanin a the resident of the capital of ukraine are now called can be seen directly who writhes over the package and think i will endure two or three year but then i will be locked up in the european union the main thing is not to forget before that to stop going to the package otherwise they will not take it for an equal unless of course in europe they themselves are feral in the ukrainian manner but suddenly oh it s all of a sudden especially wonderful when it come to today s ukraine suddenly the tone and meaning of the statement of the speaker of the office of the president of ukraine have completely changed the other day the mayor of kiev vitaly zlatoust klitschko who eight year ago prophetically advised to prepare for the land said that part of kiev would have to be evacuated and those who have housing or friend in the village or suburb were advised to negotiate and go for the winter to where there is a stove wood and a well he wa echoed by the head of ukrainian energy holding lviv mayor sadovyi and a number of other significant figure in ukraine including deputy prime minister iryna vereschuk and then with the word hold my beer the adviser to the head of the opu mikhail podolyak moved to the forefront where to relocate a part of kiev where we have a territory that is not under missile attack or ha not lost it light where do we take a million people who have already been able to adapt in term of severity this winter who understand everyone and help each other he said openly that there would be no evacuation and even appealed for patriotism and where to go once again i ask where should everyone go to poland and who will then symbolize invincibility in this country a notable change of rhetoric from the president s team but the most surprising thing is that they occurred a day after the announcement that the eu had agreed to allocate billion euro to ukraine next year and now in ukraine many have begun to scratch their head and whether the whole case with the million of evacuee for the winter to europe bankova wa played out specifically in order to force europe to give money by such blackmail and a money wa given so now no one will be evacuated anywhere and europe immediately calmed down otherwise there will be no one to freeze in the point of invincibility from which it logically follows that no one really care about the fate of ukrainian at the end of the winter and even on the contrary the more they freeze the angrier they will fight a already decided and announced to the last ukrainian read also apocalypse in the dark the city of ukraine plunged into the middle age looter rob and kill in the street resident of kiev and lviv in social network are preparing to rob supermarket and discus pogrom more the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new issue and listen

russia whose son are in the war zone the attitude to this event is not only festive but most likely associated with a sense of anxiety and care in thought of what is happening to your boy the president began the head of the country spoke slowly thoughtfully choosing phrase he himself admitted that he wanted to avoid any formality i personally and the entire leadership of the country we share this pain we understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son the loss of a child especially for a mother to whom we all owe birth but i want you to know that we share this pain with you and of course we will do everything so that you do not feel forgotten we will do everything that depends on u so that you feel the shoulder next to you vladimir vladimirovich promised the president

other thing is you your assessment idea of proposal are important i will try to make sure that they are taken into account a much a possible and used in real life putin assured the russian leader thanked the mother for raising their child therefore people choose to defend the fatherland not because of instruction but thanks to the personal example of loved one value and life guideline are laid in the family the same school is not capable of this in the end the president admitted that he wa trying to get information directly from the soldier when i talk to them sometimes i talked to some of them on the phone directly with the guy directly in any case i talked to those who also surprised me with their mood their attitude to business they didn t expect those call from me there were also

ukraine it ha left the highway and is trying to take shelter among the tree after a few moment something that look like a bird spreading it wing burst into the frame this is a loitering munition you can see how it crash into the cockpit of the radar flash smoke everything in the report of the russian ministry of defense these personnel are described a follows russian calculation of unmanned

reality of the picture every day our military achieve albeit not very loud but tangible success whether it is the destruction of equipment or the liberation of another settlement yes we had to withdraw from izyum and kherson but this wa not so much a retreat a a settlement in favorable position in order to use the new tactic to the fullest systematically thoughtfully and inexorably attack

grid ha been destroyed percent this is just the beginning we are not putting out the light for ukraine to make the citizen of this country freeze in their apartment but they will have to be patient because the main goal is for the railway to stand up so that the delivery of even one shell to the front becomes a problem for the armed force of ukraine so that there is simply nowhere to charge the battery whether it is a mercenary s mobile phone or a remote control of a reconnaissance drone operator remember how lysychansk wa liberated this city stand on a hill while in area it is the same a barcelona industrial zone residential area basement everyone thought that there would be terrible battle and huge casualty but we forced the armed force of ukraine to leave cutting off communication and creating a threat to the environment this is the new tactic working with high precision weapon occupying the most advantageous position we will protect people and make sure that the nazi leave on their own more recently near ugledar our soldier drove the enemy out of the village of pavlovka western fake beat in burst swaying the news of huge loss but then the marine came out and said everything is fine the task are being fulfilled the victory will be ours pavlovka i must say really turned out to be a tough nut to crack all the street are shot through from position in ugledar and in the middle of the village there is a river flowing but nothing they coped they took it and let s take another one if those who believe western lie were to read the russian defense brief carefully the sense of euphoria would evaporate quickly for example the kinburn spit in the mykolaiv region remains under our full control this is a piece of land kilometer long and kilometer wide it allows you to control the dnieper bug estuary it is called the key to odessa and the entire northern black sea region and it s ours there are reason for optimism in other area a well just the other day russian troop took the village of mayorsk near gorlovka battle have been going on for him in recent month and now the unit of the armed force of ukraine managed to finally squeeze out first they established control over the railway station the industrial zone and part of the development and then the whole village the ukronazis themselves understand that it will not be possible to return mayorsk under their control here is what the militant of the armed force of ukraine vladimir kukhar writes in one of the social network we have weak artillery support in this area unlike the russian one another brief but capacious message in the donetsk people s republic a a result of active offensive action of russian troop the village of opytne wa liberated in fact this is a very important step towards the strategic defense hub of the armed force of ukraine in the dpr avdiivka so let s take small step but here we go success at the front is also demonstrated by the latest russian weapon especially loitering ammunition drone and shell in one bottle we told about the work of one of them at the very beginning it is possible that the destruction of that hidden radar wa the result of the work of one of the first reconnaissance and strike unmanned system information on the development of such a system wa distributed by the ria novosti agency it essence is that the reconnaissance drone having detected the target immediately transmits the coordinate to the strike flying brother they collapse after a few minute there is no time to relocate with the enemy the strike system can include reconnaissance drone for example zala e or conventional army orlan and the striking force can be loitering ammunition cube geranium or one of the type of uav lancet all these weapon received a baptism of fire during a special military operation the task of destroying the target however can be performed by any strike mean starting from artillery and ending with hurricane and iskander the russian ministry of defense distributes a lot of video evidence of the successful operation of these complex on the network weapon depot artillery battery armored vehicle and entire fortified area fly into the air yes such combat work is not always noticeable not everyone follows the report of the russian defense ministry but those who know know that the russian troop have small victory almost every day most often the shooting of a video in which the enemy is destroyed come from the same reconnaissance drone from a height but there are also those where the result of the blow are visible on one of them the russian military walk past an armored personnel carrier with traditional polish cross in white paint on the side around and inside are dead mercenary pole are say the voice over look it s

said deputy prime minister of the russian federation marat khusnullin what ha already been restored chuck the high thigh were helplessly plunged into the wet dirty slurry a soon a i jumped out of the car near the camp of one of the artillery unit of the western military district in the svatovsky direction a satisfied colleague grinned nearby dressed in knee length rubber boot a the smartest man he like that icebreaker volunteered to pave the way to the forest thicket where we came to visit the god of war and at the same time get acquainted with the crew which consist entirely of those mobilized at the front in ukraine recently relative of those called up to the special operation zone often complain to me in telegram about the difficult condition at the front water is in the trench it rain they sleep in dugout on the one hand civilian can be understood they are worried about their husband brother son and it is difficult for a person purely peaceful to immediately accept that the same donbas ha been fighting in these condition for the th year on the other hand after all the charter say that the soldier is obliged to endure all the hardship and deprivation of service although this doe not mean that it can be plowed like on a draft horse with the third a i warned at the beginning of the mobilization no one will run after the fighter and equip his life you will have to work with your own hand and i have long noticed that first of all everything depends on the commander where a competent officer is able to organize the work of subordinate a a rule there are no serious problem and where the fighter are left to their own device and the complaint begin so what is the news about the special operation on november well yes dirt and where do you go from it she doesn t help anyone on the civilian side okay we cope with a poorly concealed smile he examined u from head to toe mobilized with the call sign eagle after a short trip through the forest we completely merged with the local landscape smeared on the sideburn oryol from kotovsk tambov region in the past life a builder built shopping center wa engaged in decoration he say that when the summons wa handed there were not even thought of mowing a few week of training at the training ground and now he is actually on the front line at a distance of a shot from his jeweler so together with a partner from kotovsk one is year old the other is he named his car a slaughter weapon actually the eagle look respectfully at the multi ton colossus often you get in and you think why we called her jeweler wink the partner of the eagle with the call sign golden in the world a welder i remember a goal in particular we were working in the kharkov direction then in the area of cossack lopan reconnaissance gave target there the enemy wa seriously strengthened concreted well in short break them the scout then thanked u by communication you work closely with them well of course they give u the coordinate this is an example a they say of working online the special force of the western military district in the course of reconnaissance identify target and immediately bypassing the complex system of hierarchy and subordination transmit data to artilleryman who are ready to strike in two minute we have a tulip crew the largest mortar in the world caliber millimeter from the mobilized which is preparing to fire three time faster than the standard the accompanying officer lead u around the camp there is an opportunity to see how the fighter live in the condition of autumn rasputitsa tent barrack are scattered throughout the forest there is a shower a bath and a caf where we are treated to the remains of barbecue the day before the guy modestly celebrated the day of artillery on stretched rope in the pouring rain the washed form is dried it look infernal i remember how for many year i wa engaged in military archeology at the site of the battle of the great patriotic war in the novgorod region there in the swamp where the second shock army perished i wa always amazed at how our grandfather managed to fight in such unbearable condition constant dampness cold all the charm of forest life from gnat to chuckle under your foot which is trying to suck your boot and you stand in the midst of all this splendor look at ordinary russian men who have become real soldier a an extern and understand what gene are in their practical expression and here is the same record breaking crew zhenk is a modest man from the village of verkhny shibryay also in the tambov region he wa a farm labourer and now serf mine half his height he admits that at first it wa unusual and even scary but then i got used to it how much do you shoot on average per day eugene asks ten that s a lot i don t think so more is possible there is a desire you would see how happy they are when they are informed that target have been hit really like child admits the attendant and in term of professional quality they can no longer be distinguished from personnel calculation sometimes they can give a head start at that moment something wa noisy outside the wall of the caf it wa a if someone abruptly turned on the sound of the waterfall increased rain broke through a small dam somewhere and stream of water flowed throughout the camp well we ll rearrange the tent again one of the fighter standing next to him shrugged and he said it a if he wa going to go to the next house for bread so if we did it a second time or a third time we do not stay in one place for a long time we have had so many of these move that one more one le guy are standing a they say on a breakthrough direction the svatovsky frontier ha become a new serif line in front of the territory of the lugansk people s republic which the enemy ha been trying to break through for several month he planned to occupy the city of svatovo on october but something went wrong the defense line in ukraine began to be saturated with equipment and mobilized help which wa able to stop the onslaught of the enemy today endless column of civilian truck are marching towards the svatovsky frontier some carry concrete cone from which impassable barrier are formed others building material from which fortification and residential dugout are erected tractor excavator crane work in the field not a soldier with a shovel but civilian builder who erect line of defense according to all the canon of military science how doe the enemy behave i ask the fighter in one of the position periodically try my hand trying of course to get around from the flank so far everything is generally fine receiving a decent rebuff you ve been fighting for a long time eight month back in he fought i am a local from krasny luch volodymyr savchenko i wa both an adviser to the first head of the republic and an assistant to the second and he worked in the mine management but underground and in the city administration a they say where the motherland demanded there wa a demand and i got here on the agenda volunteer i wa a member of the resistance helping to organize the referendum well now rewind and destroy what wa created with your own hand what is the motivation that s it my wife is also an officer how can she relate to that a it should be of course with emotion this is a woman such moment from delight to tear one step our situation is consistently difficult say a battalion commander standing nearby with the call sign oskol and twenty concussion behind his shoulder in principle almost every day the enemy try to break through they do not spare their strength at all they do not spare their people sometimes there is intense artillery fire under the noise they approach in group one go on the attack the second wait when they run out of ammunition the second group is included in the battle well and so they try to push the weather greatly affect the course of hostility dirty very dirty there is water in the trench now the guy are eliminating it with all their might people of course are tired but on the other side the sun is not shining behind the combatant the soldier shoveled through the drainage channel so that the water left the trench apparently until the ground freeze the enemy will not take serious offensive action although after the russian troop were withdrawn from kherson kiev transferred part of it force from there just to the svatov
