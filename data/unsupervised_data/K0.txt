if bought wouldn t be sent to ukraine and would be used by germany or it nato and european partner to fill the gap in their own stock created by their donation of tank to kyiv and to improve the availability of replacement part that s an issue because switzerland ha a long tradition of neutrality germany so far ha been unable to persuade the swiss to provide supply from their stockpile of ammunition for gepard self propelled anti aircraft gun that berlin provided to ukraine the ministry in an emailed response to a query after swiss daily blick reported on the request didn t specify how many tank germany would like to buy switzerland ha of the german made leopard tank of which aren t in operation according to german news agency dpa amherd this week responded to the german government

the men walk around the tank patting it chunky green armor we say please don t let u down in battle said sgt artyom knignitsky the mechanic bring u in and bring u out their respect for their tank is understandable perhaps no weapon symbolizes the ferocious violence of war more than the main battle tank tank have loomed over the conflict in ukraine in recent month militarily and diplomatically a both side prepared for offensive russia pulled reserve of tank from cold war era storage and ukraine prodded western government to supply american abrams and german leopard tank the sophisticated western tank are expected on the battlefield in the next several month the new russian armor turned up earlier and in it first wide scale deployment wa decimated a three week battle on a plain near the coal mining town of vuhledar in southern ukraine produced what ukrainian official say wa the biggest tank battle of the war so far and a stinging setback for the russian in the extended battle both side sent tank into the fray rumbling over dirt road and maneuvering around tree line with the russian thrusting forward in column and the ukrainian maneuvering defensively firing from a distance or from hiding place a russian column came into their sight when it wa over not only had russia failed to capture vuhledar but it also had made the same mistake that cost moscow hundred of tank earlier in the war advancing column into ambush blown up on mine hit with artillery or obliterated by anti tank missile the charred hulk of russian armored vehicle now litter farm field all about vuhledar according to ukrainian military drone footage ukraine s military said russia had lost at least tank and armored personnel carrier in the battle that figure could not be independently verified ukraine doe not disclose how many weapon it loses we studied the road they used then hid and waited to shoot in ambush sergeant knignitsky said lack of expertise also bedeviled the russian many of their most elite unit had been left in shamble from earlier fighting their spot were filled with newly conscripted soldier unschooled in ukraine s tactic for ambushing column in one indication that russia is running short of experienced tank commander ukrainian soldier said they captured a medic who had been reassigned to operate a tank the russian army ha focused on and even mythologized tank warfare for decade for it redolence of russian victory over the nazi in world war ii factory in the ural mountain have churned out tank by the thousand in vuhledar by last week russia had lost so many machine to sustain armored assault that they had changed tactic and resorted only to infantry attack ukrainian commander said the depth of the russian defeat wa underscored by russian military blogger who have emerged a an influential pro war voice in the country often critical of the military they have posted angry screed about the failure of repeated tank assault blaming general for misguided tactic with a storied russian weapon grey zone a telegram channel affiliated with the wagner mercenary group posted on monday that relative of the dead are inclined almost to murder and blood revenge against the general in charge of the assault near vuhledar in a detailed interview last week in an abandoned house near the front lt vladislav bayak the deputy commander of ukraine s st mechanized battalion of the nd brigade described how ukrainian soldier were able to inflict such heavy loss in what commander said wa the biggest tank battle of the war so far ambush have been ukraine s signature tactic against russian armored column since the early day of the war working from a bunker in vuhledar lieutenant bayak spotted the first column of about tank and armored personnel carrier approaching on a video feed from a drone we were ready he said we knew something like this would happen they had prepared a kill zone farther along a dirt road that the tank were rumbling down the commander needed only to give an order over the radio to battle lieutenant bayak said anti tank team hiding in tree line along the field and armed with american infrared guided javelin and ukrainian laser guided stugna p missile powered up their weapon farther away artillery battery were ready the dirt road had been left free of mine while the field all about were seeded with them so a to entice the russian to advance while preventing tank from turning around once the trap wa sprung the column of tank becomes most vulnerable lieutenant bayak said after the shooting start and driver panic and try to turn around by driving onto the mine laden shoulder of the road blown up vehicle then act a impediment slowing or stalling the column at that point ukrainian artillery open fire blowing up more armor and killing soldier who clamber out of disabled machine a scene of chaos and explosion ensues the lieutenant said russian commander have sent armored column forward for a lack of other option against ukraine s well fortified position however costly the tactic he said over about three week of the tank battle repeated russian armored assault floundered in one instance ukrainian commander called in a strike by himars guided rocket they are usually used on stationary target like ammunition depot or barrack but also proved effective against a stationary tank column the ukrainian also fired with american m and french caesar howitzer a well a other western provided weaponry such a the javelin the ukrainian tank crew that prayed before each battle nicknamed their tank the wanderer for it wandering movement around the battlefield between mission it remained hidden in tree under a camouflage net beside a road churned into a panorama of mud by passing tank five mile or so from the front line during the battle for vuhledar private hrebenok the commander wa ordered to drive forward from that spot on dangerous mission three or four time per day private hrebenok only year old had no formal training in tank combat when the war started but in the frantic first day of the war he wa assigned to a tank and ha fought continuously in them since picking up trick along the way training still loom a a problem ukraine too is losing skilled soldier and replacing them with green recruit and many ukrainian tank crewman are being trained on western tank in country like germany and britain all my knowledge i gained in the field he said the russian tank crew he said are in contrast mostly new recruit without the benefit of any combat to season them in ambush the crew hide the tank within range of a road that russian tank or armored personnel carrier might travel down then it wait quietly a they sit and prepare for ambush they must keep the engine warm because restarting it would take too long idling would be noisy instead they burn a small kerosene heater beside the motor once while they were waiting a russian armored personnel carrier passed through their sight and they fired but narrowly missed damaging but not destroying the machine in the last major engagement a week ago the order came in during the gray pre dawn to prepare an ambush for a column of russian tank and armored vehicle advancing toward the ukrainian line the crew said their prayer patted their tank and drove forward we hid the tank in a tree line and waited for them private hrebenok said it s always scary but we need to destroy them in this instance they stopped about three mile short of the ambush site just out of range of return fire and shot in coordination with a drone pilot who called in coordinate on a radio for target they could not see directly the russian column stalled on mine and private hrebenok said the wanderer opened fire the russian tank crew had little chance once they were in the kill zone he said we destroyed a lot of russian equipment he said what they did wrong wa come to ukraine germany is sending two air defense system to kiev in a move that may leave berlin unprotected armin papperger the ceo of leading german military contractor rheinmetall said in an interview with the pioneer podcast on tuesday the two system in question skynex and skyranger were commissioned by the german government to protect the airspace over berlin the arm manufacturer revealed the two unit cost around million million and will be sent to kiev within the year we had two whole system that could certainly have defended berlin papperger said a quoted by ria novosti according to the ceo four of the system would be enough to protect berlin but now their number will be inadequate on saturday thousand of protester rallied in the german capital calling for chancellor olaf scholz to stop the escalation in weapon delivery read more pentagon say it struggle to track u weapon in ukraine germany also pledged western made tank to ukraine in late january promising of it leopard tank and pledging to work with partner to create two armored battalion containing tank each however germany s eu and nato ally have been reluctant to deliver similarly to germany undermining it own protection for the sake of solidarity with ukraine denmark opted in january to send it french made caesar howitzer artillery system to kiev compromising it own defensive capability the artillery system had been a key component of denmark s plan to field a heavy infantry brigade official in some nato nation have cautioned that the constant supply of arm and ammunition to ukraine on such a massive scale would eventually come at a cost to their own defensive capability kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov ha warned on numerous occasion that providing kiev with military aid will not change the course of the conflict and will instead prolong the suffering of the ukrainian people berlin nearly a month after berlin gave european ally permission to send german made tank to ukraine the flow of tank so many leader vowed would follow seems more like a trickle some nation have discovered that the tank in their armory don t actually work or lack spare part political leader have encountered unanticipated resistance within their own coalition and even from their defense ministry and some army had to pull trainer out of retirement to teach ukrainian soldier how to use old model tank the struggle to provide leopard tank to an embattled ukraine is just the most glaring manifestation of a reality europe ha long ignored believing that large scale land war wa a thing of the past and basking in the thaw of the cold war nation chronically underfunded their military when russia launched the largest land war on the continent since world war ii they were woefully unprepared hint of the problem have surfaced repeatedly since russia invaded ukraine a year ago through shortage of weapon and ammunition but now a germany and it ally struggled for week to scrape together enough leopard s to fill two battalion of tank vehicle in total the extent of their quandary ha become even clearer the irony of this situation is not lost on germany for week chancellor olaf scholz resisted an intense public pressure campaign from ukraine s leader european politician and security expert to supply kyiv with tank and to permit other nation to send some of their own leopard despite german concern that it could be perceived by russia a a nato escalation many goaded mr scholz with a social medium campaign freetheleopards the leopard may be free now but they are scarce on the ground and some country that clamored for permission to send them to ukraine are having difficulty doing so or second thought of their own despite europe having an estimated leopard tank of different model they are among the most commonly used main battle tank across the continent pledge for ukraine are still short of the hundred it say it need germany ha offered and poland another but the number drop from there and once the currently pledged tank go into battle and get hit or break down it is not clear which leopard or which country will replace them of course some nation have delivered or at least announced that they will germany s defense minister boris pistorius said at the munich security conference this month but others have not done that that is what i m a bit shocked about he added clearly there were some nation and i will never name name here but we had some nation that preferred to hide behind germany to say we would love to if we were allowed but when we allowed it they didn t do anything privately many german and european official involved in the negotiation over tank delivery say the situation is more complicated it is not so much that nation are unwilling to make good on their promise but rather that they have faced a rude awakening a to just how difficult it is finland where many outspoken member of parliament led the call for germany to allow leopard delivery announced on thursday that it would supply three leopard mine clearing vehicle but none of it estimated leopard main battle tank some german official expressed sympathy for finland which is not yet a nato member and ha the longest border with russia of any european union nation some mile it doe not want to weaken it defense now that russia ha shown a willingness to attack a sovereign neighbor but some european official were hoping for a larger contribution from finland given promise from the united state and britain to come to it defense if necessary even before nato accession nordic country such a sweden which had long pushed for leopard delivery but on friday offered only up to are facing another unexpected problem several german official said while their politician and member of the public appear keen to offer tank to ukraine their military are not for decade european country enjoying a post cold war peace dividend had seen war a almost a thing of the past regularly cutting military support now the shrunken army tend to be protective of what they still have at nato european military are sometimes called bonsai army after the miniature tree for year the united state ha been nagging europe to increase military spending and in after russia grabbed crimea nato member agreed to spend percent of gdp by yet even today by current nato estimate only nine of the alliance s member are spending that much while a th is close thirteen country including germany were spending around percent of their g d p or even le in germany which for year clung to a foreign policy that emphasized aid and development more than hard power some saw the problem a uniquely german yearly military report to parliament offered sometimes comical glimpse of the shortage commando conducted water training at local public pool because their own facility were shut down plane could not fly soldier trained with broomstick instead of rifle even newer puma infantry fighting vehicle recently broke down en masse but other european nation are now realizing their own military may have similar trouble the trend across the board in european army ha been cutting cutting cutting said christian m lling a defense expert at the german council on foreign relation but at the end of the day many were on the same track a germany war is a theoretical thing so we have theoretical tank spain which ha leopard a tank early on sought german permission to offer some of it vehicle to ukraine now it ha discovered that many of them are in poor condition and need refurbishment that could take week or month on top of that one of the prime minister s coalition partner the leftist podemos party is closer to russia and ha been resistant to offering more support for ukraine nevertheless a germany turned the pressure back on it ally for their shortcoming spain s prime minister pedro sanchez on friday improved on his promise to send six leopard and said spain would now send ulrike franke a defense analyst at the european council on foreign relation said the struggle to find tank number raise question a to where else european military face similar shortage and maintenance problem is it just bad luck that spain ha an issue with their leopard tank but everything else work she said or do they have the same issue elsewhere doe percent of their equipment not work or is it percent m franke asked it would be a good idea for european to look at this more closely poland which ha difficult relation with germany wa foremost in pressing mr scholz and berlin on the leopard and even threatened to send some to ukraine without the necessary german permission like berlin warsaw ha some leopard tank but it say it will provide just it sent the first of the tank to ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion feb although poland ha yet to finish training ukrainian soldier how to use them warsaw may be holding off on delivery of leopard until it receives new hyundai made k tank from south korea meant to replace the german model some analyst said poland ha sent many upgraded soviet era t tank to ukraine but some european official think warsaw should be offering more leopard and some policymakers are planning meeting with polish official this week to better understand the situation even when it come to the tank that are in large supply namely the older leopard model there are complication the netherlands germany and denmark have launched a joint initiative to refurbish and send leopard model to ukraine by the end of the year but at a training session for ukrainian soldier in germany earlier this week one general said military had been forced to seek out retired leopard tank driver to come back and help train ukrainian force the old model is too unfamiliar to current military a politicized a the leopard issue ha become gustav gressel a security analyst at the european council on foreign relation argued that there were plenty of solution if european nation worked together the dutch for instance lease leopard from germany official are discussing whether it would be possible for germany to take some of them to use in place of it own leopard in lithuania and then send those to ukraine switzerland sticking to it constitutional neutrality refuse to send any of it leopard tank to ukraine but it is willing to give the tank to european union member mr gressel said country like finland or poland he said could request the swiss tank and send their own to ukraine another option would be for country to simply buy more leopard made by the german company rheinmetall and krauss maffei wegmann and send their current model to ukraine but european government and the defense industry are currently in a standoff over production state leader want industry to move first while weapon maker want longer term government order before they step up production if more government order are made analyst say the more capacity may increase thus speeding up production of weapon like tank at current rate military would face a serious tank shortage for the two to three year it would take the industry to make the new vehicle security expert say a long waiting period politician across europe are learning their army are fiercely resistant to accept that is why mr gressel argued the tank should be sent now anyway yes he said russia will reconstitute itself a a military threat to nato after this war but it will take year for them to come back a a military threat they have to rebuild an army which is shattered and almost destroyed in ukraine the german military is facing a shortage of essential hardware a a result of berlin s provision of weapon to ukraine for use in it conflict against russia according to colonel andre wustner the head of the german armed force association dbwv last february german chancellor olaf scholz vowed to invest billion billion in the bundeswehr with the aim of making it the best equipped military in europe however wustner told bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday that one year on scholz s promise remains unfulfilled for the soldier nothing ha noticeably improved since then said the head of the union which represents serving and former german troop the bundeswehr wasn t in full operational readiness even before the conflict in ukraine but the delivery of german weapon to the kiev government have further increased gap in it material supply he explained to date we haven t received a replacement for a single self propelled howitzer that we handed over to ukraine last year wustner said there s also a shortage of spare part and some of the few remaining german howitzer have to be decommissioned and dismantled for this purpose he added read more ukraine demand germany cross all weapon red line the dbwv chief also revealed that out of the approximately leopard tank possessed by the bundeswehr only are currently

ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova claimed that the ukrainian government of vladimir zelensky and it western backer have allocated million for various stunt dedicated to the anniversary of the conflict most of this money ha been stolen while the installation that were made using the remaining sum turned out to be so talentless that they backfired she wrote on telegram in recent month moscow ha repeatedly stressed it readiness to seek a diplomatic solution to the crisis however the government ha accused kiev and the west of making unacceptable proposal that showed that they were not interested in peace this saturday in berlin turned out to be hot for the german authority not in term of climate but in the sphere of political self consciousness of the population more than people demonstrated in the morning to protest against the supply of german weapon to ukraine moreover according to eyewitness representative of both left wing and right wing political party took part in the demonstration with banner with anti war slogan we call on the chancellor to stop the escalation of arm supply right away he must lead a strong alliance for a ceasefire and peace talk at both the german and european level protester appealed to olaf scholz it is unlikely that all these appeal will have at least some kind of response from the chancellor himself or official of his government who are drifting completely in the direction dictated from washington but all this movement is quite strongly undermining the position of the ruling party in the light of future election a well a the fact that in a number of supermarket in germany a on the eve and in the uk there were interruption with the already risen in price of vegetable product but something in the machine of western solidarity with ukraine broke down and worked quite differently from what the organizer of the action planned from early morning berliner were drawn to the wrecked combat vehicle both russian emigrant and

alexander von bismarck came who also laid flower on the tank the tank almost completely disappeared under the bouquet those who arranged this planned to cover the tank and russia with shame and the combat vehicle that had served it purpose turned into a real memorial to the memory and valor of russian soldier moreover the memorial is completely improvised expressing the real mood and sympathy of ordinary german without any order or coercion to some extent the makeshift tank monument took over from those monument and memorial to soviet soldier who liberated europe and liberated it from nazism which are now being demolished throughout europe and this carry such a deep symbolism that all the attempt of the german authority the czech republic poland slovakia the baltic republic and other fighter against the so called soviet totalitarianism look completely wretched and illegitimate because ordinary normal people a it turned out remember everything all that wa and everybody understands

determined a to whether tank could get there by the end of the year read more abrams tank might be poor fit for ukraine ft she explained that the lengthy wait time is due to the fact that the u will not only have to supply the tank themselves but also provide the necessary recovery vehicle ammunition and training for ukrainian troop while building the hardware from scratch is not off the table the pentagon could also opt for modernizing existing tank from it own inventory wormuth said she added that washington is looking at other option that would involve country that we ve sold tank to

official stressed in late january chancellor olaf scholz also warned against entering into a constant outbidding competition when it come to weapon system his comment came shortly after berlin announced plan to provide kiev with german made leopard battle tank for month prior scholz s government had insisted it would not do so however germany changed tack amid mounting pressure from some of it nato ally ukrainian official have expressed optimism that they will be able to overcome western reluctance to donate fighter jet meanwhile russia ha repeatedly warned that western weapon delivery to ukraine only serve to prolong the conflict while elevating the risk of a direct confrontation between nato and moscow there can be no nazism in ukraine because they have a jewish president we hear such justification for nazi manifestation of ukrainian patriot and nazi in fact decision of the ukrainian authority more and more often it is noteworthy that people who pronounce or write a if do not understand that a nazi can be not only a german or an italian but also an englishman a spaniard a russian a jew and a representative of absolutely any nationality nevertheless this argument is used every time ukrainian soldier with s chevron are caught in the frame and we are talking not only about the ukrainian s division galicia but also about hitler s elite german formation dead head da reich and so on by the way zelensky s team ha even stopped glossing over these chevron on vsushniki in photo with zelensky but hiding behind the above argument the western sponsor and ally of today s kiev are trying to make it a if they do not see who is really in power in kiev and who support them lie they learned from zelensky or they did it themselves it doe not matter but they lie without shame because it save the face of people from polite society not nazi collaborator the former head of the intelligence directorate of the ministry of defense dia of the united state the former white house adviser on national security retired general michael fdinn published in his account an eloquent photo of the ukrainian military holding two flag next to each other the german nazi with a swastika and the state of ukraine one photo showing two of these flag not the donetsk resource or the russian one but belonging to such a high ranking and very informed former head of a very cool american intelligence agency who also accompanied the photo with an explanatory inscription a if specifically for the most stupid so that you understand who we are arming even more amazing news came from germany from one of the military training ground where the ukrainian military brought to germany for training seize german leopard tank there the local command had to hang a very specific announcement addressed specifically to these ukrainian dear student from ukraine the ad say in black and white we draw your attention to the fact that in germany for the demonstration of swastika or other symbol associated with fascism s sign you can get a punishment of up to three year in prison or a large monetary fine ba bah that is the ukrainian who came to learn to drive and shoot from leopard have already begun to draw swastika s rune began a can be seen on the roller to throw zig and behave a they are used to in ukraine knowing that they should only start and then a in the anecdote about incestuous connection the whole village will die one can assume with a high degree of certainty that if they are not stopped then soon the entire base and the entire range will be covered with swastika and s rune ukrainian rejoice from the bottom of their heart that they ended up where hitler s tank moved to the soviet union including ukraine they imagine themselves a real aryan not wanting to understand that in germany this is a taboo a sign of bad taste and even a criminal act and the german are worried about them they say they will imprison unreasonable people for this you ll come home and draw what you want at the same time everyone understands that zigging is not the case when i want to go to prison not to the front this essence of the ukrainian cadaver make it way even through the german armor not today s german but today s ukrainian are the spiritual heir of hitler s s punishers and executioner it is not enough for today s ukrainian that tank and armored personnel carrier with the same cross will travel around their country a year ago they need to the point of convulsion they still want to have the emblem of those same nazi on them and today s german know this very well but they are uncomfortable admitting this therefore they turn away shamefully averting their eye so a not to see and they are trying to appease the nazi spirit of the vsushniki with modest and obscene announcement like this and what if it help after all the authority explained to them that there are no nazi in ukraine a well a nazism in it modern variation because their president is a jew and the german used to believe and obey their superior read also delivery of abrams are more dangerous than sending leopard how many tank will the united state and it ally send to kiev and wherever military expert frolov said that ukraine will not be supplied with tank if the armed force of ukraine are close to surrender detail listen also will russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year more russia may win the conflict in ukraine if the kiev government isn t supplied with western weapon in the coming week polish president andrzej duda ha said during an interview with the french newspaper le figaro on saturday duda wa asked if he thought the russian could achieve victory in ukraine yes they can if ukraine doesn t receive help very urgently the polish leader replied the kiev authority don t have modern military infrastructure but they have people he explained if we do not send military equipment to ukraine in the coming week russia s president vladimir putin may win he can win and we don t know where he ll stop duda warned his comment didn t go unnoticed by russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova who took to telegram on saturday to point out that even if western weapon are supplied to ukraine hurriedly they won t be able to change the outcome of the conflict read more much hyped tank for ukraine in short supply wsj the kiev government and it foreign backer are condemned to defeat she insisted adding that the arm delivery won t help you they ll only make thing worse repentance for what they have done is the only way out for the west zakharova wrote earlier this week the wall street journal reported that nato member who in january promised to send dozen of main battle tank to ukraine have developed sudden misgiving about fulfilling the pledge due apparently to not having enough armor to spare germany said that of it leopard tank will arrive in ukraine in late march berlin also announced that it wa buying up almost decommissioned leopard s to be refurbished and sent to the front poland which ha been one of the biggest backer of ukraine among eu state vowed to provide it neighbor with leopard s and of it modified soviet era t tank however such country a the netherlands and denmark which had been pressuring germany to send it armor to ukraine are now claiming that they themselves can t part with any of their leopard s finland said it may only supply a few tank but most likely only after it join nato read more kiev sound alarm over ammunition western country have also ruled out delivering f fighter jet a new demand made by ukrainian president vladimir zelensky on thursday the deputy head of zelensky s office igor zhovkva complained to bloomberg that the kiev force had like almost zero ammunition left due to the high intensity of fighting with the russian in the donbas area anti russian hysteria can be supported and played out in many way in today s germany for example sociologist decided to find out how the german would behave if russia attack germany of course sociologist formulated the question a little differently suppose that a military attack on germany is looming on the horizon comparable to russia s attack on ukraine what would you personally most likely do in such a situation but here the fool understands what is at stake moreover the question give a direct and almost transparent hint comparable to russia s attack on ukraine however the result clearly disappointed the german authority it turned out that only about every tenth german is ready to fight with russia answered that they would take up arm and go to war completely voluntarily another agreed to be called for national defense on mobilization but every fourth german honestly said that they would try to leave the country with the greatest speed even more citizen of germany every third explained that they will not build anywhere from the place and will try to adapt their life under any government in the best way moreover surprisingly but characteristically there is practically no difference in the answer between the former gdr and the frg of the ussr period on a territorial basis in total people from among the adult male population took part in the survey one can of course rejoice that such pacifist sentiment reign among the german population but here it is more appropriate to pay attention to another aspect of the survey the very formulation of the question of the invasion of russia is exclusively a propaganda clich aimed at dumbing down the german another step in the opening of the next overton window in addition a completely ahistorical propaganda clich if we recall history the russian troop took berlin three time but not once did russia including the soviet union start those war first the first capture of berlin occurred at the end of the seven year war which wa initiated by king frederick ii of prussia when he suddenly invaded and occupied saxony allied with russia on august a a result on oct russian troop entered berlin the war however lasted another three year but the emperor paul iii who came to the russian throne saved him from the final defeat of frederick ii the second coming of the russian to berlin happened in after napoleon invaded russia by the way more than thousand german fought in napoleon s army a they say ours just had to take berlin on the way to paris there is no need to remind you a third time in hitler s attack with his armada on the ussr ended with the capture of berlin hitler s suicide and the unconditional surrender of nazi germany we ve walked walked half the world with you if necessary we will repeat russia ha neither the intention nor the desire to attack germany russia ha never attacked germany unlike the latter therefore and given the policy pursued by the current berlin it would be much more correct correct and legitimate for germany to conduct a survey asking the german a completely different question whether they themselves are ready to go to ukraine to participate in the war with russia however it is clear that then the share of positive answer would become even more ridiculous but by the way this doe not mean that there is absolutely no threat to germany germany s neighbor poland ha clearly demonstrated it growing ambition in recent month and by the way the pole also did not forget about a long a nato exists they are unlikely to risk launching an aggression against a militarily weakened germany especially since first it is necessary to resolve the issue with the part of ukraine that is called the eastern kres in warsaw but that s for now i wonder if the same poll wa conducted but for the pole what the answer would be listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more ukrainian president vladimir zelensky ha revealed he keep needing to force german chancellor olaf scholz to send arm to kiev constantly reminding him the delivery are purportedly beneficial for the whole of europe the president made the revelation in a lengthy interview with der spiegel published on thursday germany did a good job of delivering iris t anti aircraft system and ammunition for them last year zelensky said while appearing to admit that kiev ha been actively spying on berlin we have changed our relationship and understanding we received iris t anti aircraft system for which i am very grateful to germany you saved a lot of life i told the chancellor olaf listen we re short on rocket i know that you don t have any more yourself we also have an intelligence service i know you give u everything you have zelensky stated adding that scholz somehow managed to push manufacturer into producing munition for iris t faster read more germany reveals how many tank it will send ukraine the looming supply of modern tank to ukraine ha also proved to be a difficult issue for kiev and berlin a scholz wa reluctant to do so zelensky claimed he ha had to constantly remind the chancellor about the purported importance of such support and it alleged value for the whole of europe now we are yet again in a difficult phase with this debate about the german tank it is emotional and complex i have to force him to help ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not for u but for the european zelensky stated germany ha long been reluctant to deliver modern tank to kiev with scholz giving in to kiev s demand on january and pledging to send in leopard armored vehicle a well a allowing other european operator of the german made tank to re export them to ukraine apart from that berlin also pledged to send in some older leopard model to ukraine from it stock a well moscow ha repeatedly urged the west to stop pumping ukraine with assorted weaponry maintaining that continuous aid would only prolong the hostility rather than change the ultimate outcome of them german defense minister boris pistorius ha expressed uncertainty over ukraine s ability to achieve it goal of retaking crimea and donbas the official claimed that the west s continued support for kiev would be key in determining the outcome of the conflict with russia speaking to germany s bild newspaper on tuesday during an official visit to the ukrainian capital pistorius wa asked if kiev would manage to restore control over all the territory within it border the minister described the question a difficult and likened it to a look into the crystal ball while stopping short of a prediction pistorius commended the bravery of kiev s force adding that it is vital that we continue to support ukraine to the best of our ability this is an intense war of attrition there are insanely high loss the german official said when asked if he stood by his previous maxim that ukraine must win the war pistorius replied yes of course read more germany reveals how many tank it will send ukraine according to the german minister much like ukraine s ability to make territorial gain the prospect of peace negotiation remains uncertain pistorius who took office on january confirmed berlin s commitment to providing kiev with leopard a main battle tank by late march with the training of ukrainian personnel expected to start in the near future pistorius stressed that he see the delivery of air defense system in the coming month a crucial while calling into question the potential usefulness of submarine should kiev request them further down the line responding to western nation plan to supply ukraine with tank and other heavy weapon russian defense minister sergey shoigu warned on tuesday that such move are essentially dragging nato country into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable escalation however he expressed confidence that the russian military would destroy the hardware top russian official have consistently argued that western arm delivery only serve to prolong the conflict unnecessarily america s f fighter jet should remain in the country and not be sent to ukraine u president joe biden said on monday he earlier signaled that washington ha no plan to send the warplane to kiev amid the conflict with moscow speaking to reporter on the white house lawn biden wa asked to explain why he opposes f delivery for ukraine because we should keep them here that s a totally different situation he replied without elaborating his remark come after the u agreed last month to send m abrams tank to ukraine along with some of washington s ally which agreed to send modern battle tank a well around the same time however biden dismissed the idea of sending f s to kiev read more biden comment on f jet for ukraine his refusal however doe not eliminate the possibility that washington could approve the re export of the warplane from other country in an interview with the financial time last month a senior executive with lockheed martin which produce f s said that there is a lot of conversation about third party transfer of f s to ukraine in an interview on monday polish defense minister mariusz blaszczak wa asked whether warsaw will hand over it f jet to ukraine he replied we have too few of them only this come after prime minister mateusz morawiecki said he is open to delivery of warplane but only if this is a decision of the whole of nato russia ha repeatedly warned the west against supplying ukraine with weapon arguing that it will only prolong the conflict last week kremlin press secretary dmitry peskov said that with kiev receiving new arm shipment russia would double down on using it existing potential to respond germany s european ally have been suspiciously quiet after it promised to send western made tank to ukraine the leader of the social democratic party of germany spd kevin k hnert said on sunday berlin is struggling to find leopard s for kiev to use in the conflict with russia according to the politician over the last couple of week there ha been an impression that everyone want to supply western made tank to ukraine and that germany wa the only one not doing so k hnert said in a zdf interview now we see that germany made specific obligation to deliver a tank company and suddenly it got very silent around u the spd leader also noted berlin s low supply of the leopard and ammunition for them explaining that there is not a big warehouse where all the tank are ready and waiting to be ordered the supply are scarce k hnert told zdf read more swiss lawmaker oppose return of tank to germany chancellor olaf scholz confirmed the shipment of leopard tank to kiev in late january in addition to this the government gave permission for other operator of the german made tank to transfer their stock u president joe biden confirmed on the same day that america would send of it m abrams tank however a wa the case with germany no timeline wa provided for the shipment pentagon spokeswoman sabrina singh said last week that washington simply doesn t have these tank available in excess in their stock greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis told nikkei asia last week that athens cannot spare their leopard tank a they are absolutely necessary for our defense posture kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov ha commented on the western tank shipment for ukraine numerous time saying in late january that they will burn like every other weapon in the conflict zone peskov said at a press briefing last week that the more weapon the west sends the more russia will utilize it military potential to counter them the prevailing thinking in the white house and the pentagon revolves around giving to ukraine the right kit first stinger and javelin then himars patriot bradley and now abrams tank after zelenskyy got his tank he is now asking for f fighter jet something the president ha so far denied regardless of the driving factor biden appears to be on shaky ground especially during this critical time when the conflict in ukraine will likely escalate into a broader war in europe and very possibly will drag the united state into it too there will be no repeat of the world war ii battle of kursk in which german tank clashed with soviet armor nearly double that number after an eight day slogging match the russian won by what one military historian called suicidal bravery by getting close enough to throw mine under the tank and having aircraft pick off german tank from above consistent with russia s warfare style soviet force out sacrificed the german with the russian losing tank while the german lost putin view the war in ukraine a his cuban missile crisis a ukraine s potential acceptance into nato would bring the alliance even closer to russia s border moscow is putting everything on the line to minimize this risk that it view a unacceptable the pentagon is foolish to assume that the abrams tank will become a game changer in the war and will bring peace to ukraine it is for this reason that every abrams that is sold to foreign customer even ally ha the depleted uranium armor which is intended to mitigate vulnerability removed according to the specialized military website breaking defense what ha become an unrestricted supply of top of the line materiel to ukraine which is not

washington recently promised to ukraine might end up being a liability rather than a boost to kiev s war effort the financial time reported on sunday such a view is explained by the armor s overcomplicated logistics and maintenance need the tonne tank ha a gas turbine engine which allows it greater acceleration than a diesel engine but requires meticulous maintenance and consumes larger amount of fuel the ft explained the paper cited former u army platoon commander john nagl who said his soldier spent a whole lot of time literally banging our air filter during the gulf war and the u invasion of iraq amid big concern about the tank engine ingesting sand and not working maintaining the combat readiness of the abrams tank would require completely different type of machinery relative to other western designed tank promised to kiev a well a crew trained for special gadget the ft highlighted the mechanic crew for the tank would also take longer to train the paper reported the tank

considers crimea and four other new russian region to be part of ukraine in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper published on saturday night chancellor scholz once again placed all of the blame for the conflict on moscow arguing that russia s unprovoked aggression justified the collective west s intervention with military aid to protect the european peace order together with our ally

battle of stalingrad on thursday russian president vladimir putin said it wa unbelievable but true we are once again threatened with german leopard tank with cross on their hull and once again seeking to battle russia in ukraine with the help of hitler s follower the banderites those seeking to defeat russia on the battlefield apparently do not realize that a modern war with russia would be entirely different for them he added promising a response that go beyond armored vehicle read more pentagon will allow ukraine to fire long range missile at will no putin didn t threaten me or germany scholz said regarding phone conversation with the russian leader when the interviewer brought up recent claim by ex uk prime minister boris johnson the kremlin stated that johnson had either

supply an ever growing list of weaponry to kyiv a it seek to defend itself small arm to anti tank weapon to artillery to missile to tank such expansion particularly the deal this month to begin supplying ukraine with german and u s made tank ha promised equipment that previously seemed off limit so what about ukrainian official call for some of it ally most potent weapon military jet a top adviser to mr zelensky andriy yermak suggested on monday that ukraine had begun pressing nato country on the question of warplane saying on telegram that kyiv had received positive signal from poland about f fighter jet poland an early advocate of sending german made tank to ukraine ha stressed that it coordinate weapon decision with other nato member and wopke hoekstra the foreign minister of another nato member the netherlands recently told dutch lawmaker that the government would be willing to send american made f jet if the united state authorized the transfer however on monday

use of the jet entirely or just an immediate transfer of them other leader have been more direct chancellor olaf scholz of germany reiterated recently that berlin would not send fighter jet to ukraine that we are not talking about fighter aircraft is something i made clear very early on and i m making that clear here a well he said in an announcement that germany would send ukraine tank on monday britain s defense minister ben wallace acknowledged the question about aircraft in remark to member of parliament since we took on the battle over getting tank to ukraine people are understandably asking what will be the next capability he said what we know about all these demand is that the initial response is no but the eventual response is yes britain mr wallace said would track the progress of discussion among western ally but noted that decision about military aid are not an ad hoc thing last week the u s stance seemed flexible a pentagon spokeswoman sabrina singh said then that she didn t believe the united state had ever drawn a line over the arm it wa willing to supply and emphasized that the u s wa providing ukraine with significant air defense capability but should western nation provide advanced aircraft training for ukrainian pilot would be a complicating factor she said requiring more people to come off the battlefield to learn an entirely new system were fighter jet to be sent ukrainian pilot would not be the only one needing training the logistics needed to support a tranche of aircraft unfamiliar to ukrainian mechanic who are trained on soviet era equipment would be extensive and time consuming and just how such aircraft would be utilized remains an open question the proliferation of surface to air missile on both side ha ensured that air combat and bombing run are rare compared to the grinding artillery battle that have come to define the war the united state supply of agm harm anti radar missile that began arriving over the summer ha allowed ukraine s air force primarily composed of soviet era jet and helicopter to fire their ordnance far enough away from the front line a to not be exposed to russian air defense a supply of new jet would reduce ukraine s disadvantage versus the russian air force and simplify the use of western air launched munition but this is a lower priority issue all thing considered said michael kofman the director of russian study at c n a a research institute in arlington va alexander mikhailovich hello and you are in moscow or in chita i m in moscow now hello thank god otherwise i think it s night in chita the call wa at gmt and i m the name here first of all the traditional question is how is our hero in the svo zone we are talking of course about the former mayor of chita alexander sapozhnikov who in november resigned from the post of mayor and went to the svo zone i think alexander you understood what he wa talking about there in our recent communication session about new task about the assault unit a part of which he actively participates in the assault well this should have been expected from him because a combat man went through the chechen war and served in the army for more than a dozen year that s it yes yes no more news from him like there what no a i went to this new stage then now there is no connection we will pray that everything will be good that they will complete all the task and that they will be alive and healthy sure sure let u pray let u wait for him with victory but we were also very interested in the information that the trans baikal governor signed a decree on payment from thousand to million ruble to resident of the region who manage to destroy or capture leopard or abrams tank in the special operation zone yes so can you comment on what meaning you meant when you signed this document we all transbaikalia are now diligently helping the warrior with all our might all that our citizen can do is sew produce assemble send and so on car wagon everything you can even the buzy wa plastered and sent to the svo zone a truck buz and our neighbor too are buryatia and the amur region what s the point buzy even plastered buzy this who doe not know is a national buryat dish they were apparently frozen before being sent it s something like manta ray yes a big open dumpling oops cool delicious in general we do everything we can and we are well aware that our compatriot are sitting in trench many are participating in the assault of the most important i will not be able to disclose this information but our guy are in the most responsible area that s understandable well a for the payouts those guy who will destroy these vaunted western tank we want to support and thank in every possible way including on the part of the government and the trans baikal territory to add some money to them for this tell me please why is such a fork from thousand ruble to million if you hit a caterpillar if it s a tower there we have the following payment for the capture of the leopard million for the capture of the abrams or any other main battle tank produced by nato country million ruble and this is due first of all to the fact that well i myself am a tanker i served in dnepropetrovsk in krivoy rog and so on so you re a tanker yes tanker so look other nato tank are still well inferior in my opinion according to my knowledge to the leopard especially the latest modification it s time but the second thing is most importantly there is nothing to do at all for any foreign equipment on our land and even more so for german tank it s outrageous such a brazen challenge therefore of course for the leopard you need to pay definitely more others cost le and of course there is a different motivation here here and payment one thing directly to the fighter who hit destroyed the tank another thing is that the fighter must act coherently therefore the work of the entire unit should be taken into account here and all those who will participate in the operation to capture or destroy tank they also deserve a reward therefore they depending on participation up to thousand ruble for assistance in this combat operation but if your guy transbaikalians i also know them well studied i lived in transbaikalia for year will begin to burn these tank by the dozen and knock out whether you have enough money in the treasury to pay bonus for each downed leopard i m sure there s enough money and even if there is a problem with the treasury our people collect money and enterprise will help there is no money for this so let s write it down for each leopard million for each abrams one and a half yes abrams challenger leclerc and all the rest of their one and a half of them yeah but it s certainly not about the money the main thing is that our guy are defending the motherland and all of them are strong in spirit listen a well futurologist told what to expect in russia in more judging by the latest leak in the american press kiev will be able to get the first coveted abrams not earlier than the end of this year the supply of the remaining tank is also stretched in time and space the same leopard according to berlin will go to ukraine in two stage in the first batch in three month new car will be delivered in the second apparently what will be collected from storage it is unlikely that ukraine will store all these supply until an offensive tank fist is assembled this mean that the incoming car will go straight to the front in portion which of course is preferable for u we will burn them in small batch and you can burn them the same history of the abrams show this in the persian gulf during the war abrams were destroyed during the first two year of the iraq war of more than vehicle were put out of action the houthis destroyed about abrams from the saudi to me the greater threat is the artillery that the west will supply to ukraine let s see how much the nato military industrial complex will cope with logistics repair and production of ammunition and kiev now depends entirely on them read also russia s new tactic a serious strengthening of the armed force of ukraine and the truth about the battle on the frontline answer to uncomfortable question about the special operation voenkor alexander kots spoke about the new tactic of russia which broke through the gap in the defense of the armed force of

germany neither with arm delivery nor anything else because otherwise germany will be in the middle of it again the latter he claimed is just what america want another protester lamented that if thing

taxpayer in november congressional republican called for an audit of u government fund appropriated for aid to ukraine a month later however the initiative wa narrowly defeated in the house of representative with democrat arguing that it would send the wrong signal to kiev russia ha repeatedly warned the west against supplying ukraine with weapon on wednesday commenting on the decision to ship abrams kremlin press secretary dmitry peskov commented that this armor would burn similar to all the other military vehicle provided to kiev by it western backer the aim that germany is striving to achieve by assisting ukraine in it conflict with russia is to prevent moscow from changing border through force german chancellor olaf scholz ha said the statement come day after berlin promised to provide kiev with it leopard tank after week of pressure from the u and other nato ally in a brief video address on saturday scholz said that germany ha been pursuing a three pronged policy since the outbreak of the conflict he defined the three facet a helping kiev with humanitarian aid finance and weapon working to prevent an escalation because a war between russia and nato shouldn t happen and working in strict coordination with it ally especially the u while refraining from any unilateral move this is the approach that the german government will stick to going forward the chancellor assured according to scholz his cabinet s decision to supply leopard main battle tank to ukraine and allow other country to also provide german made armor to the zelensky government wa made in line with that policy read more no joy over tank supply to ukraine german defense minister our goal is clear in ukraine the german leader said russia mustn t succeed in changing border through force in autumn four former ukrainian territory zaporozhye and kherson region a well a the donetsk and lugansk people s republic joined the russian state after their population overwhelmingly supported doing so in referendum crimea did the same back in after a coup in kiev a survey carried out by the pollster yougov on behalf of the dpa news agency last week revealed that of german were against giving tank to kiev were in favor of doing so with remaining undecided many citizen are very worried of course you want peace in europe war not getting closer and the government and the chancellor keeping their nerve and i promise this to you scholz said kremlin press secretary dmitry peskov said that russia view the announced delivery of tank by germany the u and uk to ukraine a the direct involvement of nato in the conflict in ukraine and this involvement is growing he stressed read more germany comment on fighter jet for ukraine however peskov stated that the western armor would not be a game changer in the conflict saying that nato clearly overestimate the potential that this is going to add to the ukrainian military in a separate interview he pointed out that berlin s decision to provide leopard s to kiev will definitely leave a mark on russian german relation that are already at a low point yougov a research center close to the british government published a survey how do you feel about the fact that the uk could supply ukraine with fighter jet such a probing of public opinion and judging by the answer the majority of resident of foggy albion do not see anything wrong with these delivery quarter of the population generally on the drum percent either support the transfer of aircraft to kiev or do not object we ve been following the dramatic play about the difficult relationship between the u s and germany for the past week they depicted the battle of the titan you first go the tank no you in fact this is a homemade blank played for a large audience everything wa a foregone conclusion and all these delivery are formed under the plan of attack in the spring summer ukrainian campaign it is compiled of course not in kiev in my opinion in the line of delivery of western equipment to ukraine it is not the tank that should be more alarming but the number of artillery it s a whole artillery corp three brigade paladin self propelled gun are an excellent weapon archer is a little worse but also serious a caesar which ha already established itself in combat tank probably add spice to all these delivery what is known at this point absolutely the united state will deliver abrams to ukraine germany promise leopard united kingdom challenger poland say it want to deliver leopard plus it is going to but ha not yet decided when to send portugal piece the netherlands some quantity norway up to finland denmark it wa announced that the first batch of leopard will come to ukraine in month but most likely these term will be shortened such an international that is going to clench a tank fist in the area of the line of contact let s proceed from the fact that we knocked out all the soviet equipment from ukraine she is starving we solve these problem at the expense of our military industry and kiev doe not have such an opportunity so they are forced to switch to the donation of the west but dependence on the nato manufacturer may at some point prove fatal nevertheless the scale of supply cannot but strain what to do with them the simplest answer is to hit even behind enemy line before they cross the dnieper and cut the bridge connecting the two bank but a the last month have shown the enemy doe not have much logistical problem a a result of our strike and all delivery of recent time are more or le secretively by civilian transport truck what need to be done to bring down these bridge this can be done for example by strategic aviation what need to be done to make strategic aviation work on ukraine it is necessary to suppress air defense system but we need to calculate the option that they will still reach the line of contact and how we will meet them there is also very important in the persian gulf during the war abrams were destroyed during the first two year of the iraq war of more than vehicle were put out of action the houthis destroyed about abrams from the saudi the abrams are not some kind of wunderwaffe that will provide ukraine with bloodless progress through the territory controlled by the russian army but these supply cannot be treated condescendingly either these are serious high tech weapon sooner or later we will have to face them a with a huge amount of new artillery and this mean that we need to improve the counter battery struggle in two month this of course is a difficult task it is impossible to transfer already trained artilleryman and anti tank battalion to the infantry after all they will have to burn american british german and other equipment in month and we will simply have nowhere to take them we have now imposed our initiative on the enemy we have several point where he feel quite uncomfortable firstly it is zaporozhye there are now interesting event in the orekhov area the enemy is forced to transfer reserve there including by the way from the donetsk direction and at this time taking advantage of this there is an offensive in the south donetsk direction ugledar we have already clung to the first house cutting almost all the road of it supply of the relatively safe one only one remained the route to kurakhovo but it is also under the fire control of our gunner because we control most of marinka and from there we see supply route an operation is underway to capture artemovsk the largest node of the enemy s defense to the north of it there is fighting in the direction of seversk ukrainian troop do not have the ability to concentrate large force in any one direction they are forced to send fire brigade back and forth this is probably the same blank under which the castling wa carried out in the command of a special military operation i think that the preparatory measure were carried out by the former commander sergei surovikin after which he handed over the rein of power to the chief of the general staff gerasimov who is now responsible for everything both success and defeat if any but perhaps this is the very expansion of the format of the special operation along with the supply of tank which the ministry of defense told u about when it explained the reshuffle in the command yes in the course of this conflict problem in our military machine have also been revealed but it s good that we ve learned about them now someone say that probably the commander in chief doesn t have the whole picture there is and i know it for sure people who are not young but who live a long time in our country know perfectly well that it is useless to expect sharp personnel decision from vladimir vladimirovich and in general the expected decision someone might and would like flying head and ripped off shoulder strap but that s not our president s style we have a list of what is missing understanding where you need what is needed is the same we need to see how the industry and the leadership of the defence ministry will cope with this ukraine s former ambassador to germany andrey melnik ha suggested that berlin should hand over one of it submarine for use against russia s black sea fleet throughout the conflict in ukraine melnik belittled and insulted his then host until they agreed to donate increasingly heavier weapon to his country i know i m gonna get a new s t storm but i have another creative idea melnik who became deputy foreign minister last november tweeted on saturday explaining that the thyssenkrupp manufactured hdw class a is considered one of the world s best submarine the german military bundeswehr should donate one of it six a to ukraine where it would kick the russian fleet out of the black sea in a series of response to comment melnik called on his supporter to champion this idea all together and push germany and other ally into handing over the sub hi guy i know i m gonna get a new shit storm but i have another creative idea germany thyssenkrupp produce one of the world s best submarine hdw class a the bundeswehr ha such u boat why not to send one to ukraine then we ll kick fleet out of the black sea pic twitter com qy srvz andrij melnyk melnykandrij january if germany would agree to such a deal transporting the sub to the black sea would be complicated by t rkiye s

fighter jet for ukraine melnik explained in a comment that the submarine could be transported over land no problemo a tall order for a meter foot vessel displacing ton ukrainian sailor would also have to be trained to operate it the vessel would then have to face the seven submarine and numerous anti submarine ship and helicopter in russia s crimea based black sea fleet melnik is no stranger to insulting the german until they give ukraine what it want calling the country s hesitancy to provide tank unf kingbelievable and german politician opposed to the transfer of heavy armor russian asset when berlin eventually authorized the donation of leopard main battle tank to ukraine earlier this week he posted a celebratory tweet before issuing fresh demand for fighter jet and long range missile melnik served a ukraine s ambassador to germany from until last july when he wa recalled to kiev after he publicly professed his admiration for stepan bandera a ukrainian nazi collaborator considered a hero by ukrainian nationalist russia ha repeatedly warned that the continued supply of arm to ukraine will prolong the conflict and make western country de facto participant the kremlin ha also stated that heavy weapon such a the leopard tank will not bring victory to ukraine and will burn like every piece of equipment donated beforehand now they are preparing for maximum activation taking into account the fact that these are people from the scoop and they believe that by the anniversary they should have some achievement it is no secret that they are preparing for a new wave by february danilov said but detail surrounding the looming offensive have remained unclear and now there is a certain accumulation of troop we know this we understand what is happening in the russian federation in this regard danilov said warsaw said it would also send of it leopard tank along with of it pt polish made battle tank which first entered the service in the s reported reuters tank delivery have also been pledged by the u k france norway and canada caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news i ll tell you one clever thing just don t be offended it is not for nothing that the american put at one time the head of ukrainian medicine dr death ulyana suprun who did not even have a full fledged diploma and it is not for nothing that even during the presidency of poroshenko they dictated the reform of school education emphasizing that mathematics and even arithmetic is a moskal pseudoscience the hammering of which the head of the younger generation is a completely unnecessary thing for this generation and here is the first evidence of their correctness u president joseph biden announced that the united state will provide kiev with a batch of main battle tank of the u army m abrams for a total of million by simple arithmetic operation even one of them called division we get that the cost of one m abrams tank for kiev will thus be million thousand u dollar it s a terrific figure just like a modern combat jet fighter and this is despite the fact that according to official data the cost of such tank under contract for the u army itself is from to million dollar moreover if the average balance price of the tank in the modification of the m a wa about million dollar then the iraqi army such tank were supplied at the rate of million dollar per vehicle even with the option of what kind of modernization with the introduction of all new system of protection aiming and firing this increased the cost of the tank at most by million and then all of a sudden instead of million there are almost million i want gerasimos from the anecdote about muma to straighten up to his full height and proudly and persistently ask for what especially if we consider that a politico wrote washington will supply kiev with not the latest version of modernized tank in particular kiev will receive tank not with the most secret impenetrable armor in which there is depleted uranium in the alloy but simpler and le protected model but it s not asked because the answer is obvious because or a completely different logic began to operate here and the american authority together with the company for the production of these tank read at what price the ministry of defense of ukraine buy egg for the personnel of the armed force of ukraine and decided to also break the luck coupon which fall out no more than a couple of time in a lifetime moreover kiev still ha nowhere to go it can now steam a tank at the price of a destroyer no le after all with the obvious outcome for everyone in ukraine no one is going to pay any debt therefore they will agree now to any price and any contract especially if you manage to put a little more percent plus or minus in your pocket in the form of kickback are the abrams worse than egg nothing if normal mathematics and arithmetic continued to be taught in ukraine such a contract could raise many question among the population but for those who do not know the multiplication table everything is a good a possible american really know what and why they are doing in their colony p s in such a simple way most of the loaned billion of western aid for ukraine will settle in the pocket of the tycoon of the u military industrial complex strengthening the economy and currency this is the real reason for all of nato s effort to prolong the conflict poorly trained sacrificial ukrainian forge dollar for the state with their blood it s unclear when ukraine will receive abrams tank from

they won t be the silver bullet that allows kyiv to win the war instead the united state military will once again attempt to remake an army in it own image to give ukraine the best chance to break through entrenched russian defense to do that the united state and it ally will not just have to provide the newly promised tank armored vehicle and advanced munition but also expand what ha been something of an ad hoc training program to teach ukraine s military to use all the new equipment together it will be a crash course in what the u s military call combined arm warfare something that take month if not year for american unit to master decision about new military aid are a delicate balancing act for the white house and the nato alliance while they want to provide kyiv with new capability that have the potential to break through a battlefield stalemate they also don t want to provoke president vladimir v putin of russia into escalating the fight into a wider war a a result providing the western tank produced considerable hand wringing but so far moscow ha been deterred from expanding the war and creating newer and stronger ukrainian unit represents the best chance of avoiding a stalemate a satellite imagery revealed russian building primary and secondary line of defensive trench along the front line american government analyst began the year forecasting a deadly stalemate a the likely outcome for worried that a frozen conflict favor russia the united state and it ally began more earnest discussion in recent week about how to change the battlefield dynamic in

that is far more advantageous for their long term future and that putin feel the strategic failure victoria nuland a senior state department official told the senate on thursday much of the first year of the conflict ha involved russia and ukraine pounding each other s position with artillery but there have been some tank operation ukraine s biggest success it counteroffensive outside kharkiv used tank but some of the most important weaponry were the quick moving armored fighting vehicle there ukraine also faced disorganized russian force but in the next phase of the war the ukrainian military will target those dug in trench line of russian unit breaking through those line is not just about driving a battalion of tank over the trench it requires a coordinated attack with infantry troop marking target tank firing at those position and artillery gun providing cover and support such combined arm maneuver are the backbone of u s military combat operation and the focus of the u s army s most intense training though tank have been the focus of attention military analyst say a critical part of the recent donation by the west may be the bradley fighting vehicle the united state is sending and the large number of artillery gun that european ally will send this equipment is likely to be combined with the german leopard to help create new ukrainian armored unit when the full package of western equipment arrives kyiv could create a many a three additional brigade the most important part of the package are armored fighting vehicle artillery and precision guided munition said michael kofman the russia expert at cna a washington analytic organization the small number of tank promised are the least significant part of this to ensure ukraine s army can conduct such maneuver will involve an increase in american and european training for month the united state avoided sending ukraine complex new system that require new training that attitude ha shifted first when the united state sent american artillery then longer range missile system and most recently the patriot battery system all of which required training outside ukraine the initial hesitancy wa in part because of concern about taking experienced ukrainian soldier off the battlefield a well a worry that having the united state train ukrainian soldier could be seen by the kremlin a a provocation but with training on patriot missile defense system underway in oklahoma and instruction on intensive maneuver warfare underway at america s training ground in germany the original concern have faded u s military official have acknowledged this isn t the first time the united state ha done this kind of training the united state tried and failed to teach such technique to the iraqi army and to a lesser degree the afghan military but ukraine ha proved itself time and time again to be technically capable and resourceful and it army ha shown itself extremely motivated to learn how to employ new equipment ukrainian have a core professional army group that ha been fighting the russian for year and year and year and received western training until said stephen biddle a professor at columbia university they are not starting from scratch just how realistic it might be for the pentagon to train the ukrainian in the complexity of combined arm maneuver warfare in a short time span remains to be seen even in peacetime it take a while for american unit to master such operation and that s with the luxury of expansive training area and deep institutional knowledge still new warfare technique can be learned under fire after all the american army first learned modern combined arm technique in the midst of world war ii military that are properly motivated and have the right kind of command structure adapt and learn pretty quickly dr biddle said there is this view out there that military never change and that s nonsense they can change really fast when they re motivated and they re organized correctly some analyst believe the single most effective weapon the united state could give ukraine is precision guided missile ukraine s army by training and tradition focus on artillery it is that expertise that allowed them to quickly and effectively use the high mobility artillery rocket system or himars to strike russian ammunition depot and command post russia ha adjusted pulling back it logistics hub outside the range of the himars a more advanced longer range missile like the atacms could hit those target but for now weapon that could strike deep into russia are off the table seen a far too likely to provoke mr putin though the united state ha steadily opened up to providing ukraine with more powerful weaponry over the course of the conflict it ha remained resolute on this one point american official acknowledged that the true power of the abrams tank the united state announced on wednesday it would send ukraine is that they will unlock more donation of german made leopard tank a well a more artillery and infantry fighting vehicle the u s provision of the tank will spur the german and inspire the pole while demonstrating nato unity said one u s official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discus sensitive deliberation in addition to the leopard germany will send poland ha pledged along with hundred of older tank and canada will send four norway said it will send some of the tank and spain is considering a donation the new donation alone are unlikely to boost combat power enough to win the war for ukraine but official and outside analyst say they will help substantially the tank will punch through the trench line and open a path for infantry in bradley fighting vehicle to hold the reclaimed territory and the tank send important signal to both ukraine and russia about continued american support for russia the tank demonstrate that the flow of arm from the west is growing not waning and for ukraine it is a big morale boost said andrea

abrams tank broke a stalemate with berlin which had refused to send it own leopard tank or allow ally to re export them to kiev unless the united state followed suit ukrainian official had long

weapon into ukraine saying the arm will only prolong the conflict and make a negotiated settlement impossible russia s ambassador to the u anatoly antonov condemned the upcoming tank shipment a another blatant provocation insisting the hardware will be destroyed by russian force the uk ha no plan to send it advanced fighter jet to ukraine due to concern that such a move would lead to an escalation of the conflict between moscow and kiev the telegraph reported on wednesday citing source on wednesday following a decision by germany and the u to supply ukraine with modern western made

ukraine with longer range precision missile telegraph source cautioned that such a step is not being considered right now last week the dutch government said it wa ready to consider delivery of f

that his country would send leopard tank to ukraine and wa acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally on the same day u president joe biden said washington would supply kiev with abrams main battle tank portraying them a a defensive weapon and not a threat to russia russia s ambassador to germany sergey nechayev said the delivery of leopard tank clearly show that germany and it closest ally are not interested in a diplomatic solution in ukraine but will continue the unlimited pumping of ukraine with new deadly weapon moscow ha repeatedly warned the west against providing ukraine with weapon arguing that it would only prolong the conflict anatoly antonov russia s ambassador to washington described the upcoming tank delivery a another blatant provocation claiming that

germany by the end of the month ukraine s ministry of defense took to twitter wednesday to celebrate the start of the training the tank are expected to arrive in ukraine before the end of march pistorius said germany is initially sending leopard tank though it could send a many a tank to ukraine the united state will send more than abrams m tank the pentagon announced the associated press contributed to this report despite president biden s promise to send abrams m tank to ukraine on wednesday it could take month for the artillery to arrive according to report the new york post reported that pentagon spokesperson sabrina singh confirmed that the u s doe not have enough of m abrams tank in it stockpile to send over to ukraine at this time we just don t have these tank available in excess in our u stock which is why it is going to take month to transfer these m a abrams to ukraine singh told the post if the tank were in the pentagon s possession it would take le than a week to get the tank boxed and shipped but when using the ukraine security assistance initiative or usai program it could take month or year because the government go through procurement to identify and hire contractor to build the weapon biden announced the weapon approval on wednesday just hour after german chancellor olaf scholtz said ukraine would also get leopard tank from berlin a russia plan for a major offensive secretary of defense lloyd austin and defense secretary joined the president antony blinkin who described the tank a the most capable tank in the world which will enhance ukraine s ability on the battlefield this is about freedom freedom for ukraine freedom everywhere biden said earlier this month germany suggested it would not agree to send it tank to ukraine unless the u s did a well citing concern over escalating the war while senior defense official would not confirm if the decision wa a stipulation of berlin s or motivation from washington to get germany to roll out the leopard tank the move wa championed a a show of long term support for ukraine the u s ha already supplied thousand of combat vehicle including humvee and pledged earlier this month to send another armored vehicle of several type the abrams tank will be procured through the ukraine security assistance initiative and will not come directly from u s stockpile it remains unclear how long it will take to get the abrams tank up and running in ukraine and defense official did not say where the training will take place though it wa confirmed that the training would be

be smeared with cross or vice versa they will draw the s lightning and fascist rune of the ukrainian nazbats the united state and other nato country promised ukraine horde of armor tank infantry fighting vehicle ifvs and armored personnel carrier some american are already preparing to send kiev abrams tank about bradley ifvs and about the same number of stryker armored fighting vehicle together with this iron alone it is already being recruited for a motorized infantry division and the colony of the united state in europe pole british german spaniard dane dutch norwegian also promise to throw off only one leopard tank will be collected under two hundred the german are already shipping a dozen of their leopard the british are promising to transfer challenger and the french about modern leclers moreover they decided to sell or donate tank to ukraine not only to nato country out of of them but also their ally australia south korea japan so it is not yet possible to accurately calculate all it number but it is already clear that the request of the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine general zaluzhny give me tank and bmps and i will be able to advance including on the crimea it seems that nato will fulfill biden even blurted out announcing the supply of abrams ukraine promised to advance someone in the west ha already nicknamed all this collection of combat vehicle the tank coalition and of course it should not be underestimated but no one is going to raise their hand up in advance let s take a better look how can we stop this nato tank armada can our tank or other russian weapon smash it if we evaluate the tank zoo promised to kiev the main threat to u will come from the german leopard judging by the name of this machine it grew up in the same german menagerie a the tiger with the panther which our grandfather burned well in the field of the great patriotic war liverwurst a the ukrainian ambassador to berlin called german chancellor scholz a we see could not resist u pressure scholz initially said that german tank in the former soviet union would evoke bad association and now i ve changed my mind and he sends leopard to ukraine with the same german cross on their side these tank are even made at the same factory where tiger and panther were once riveted well what kind of beast is this a modern german cat german believe that their modern leopard is the best in the world and ha no equal although unlike our t it ha a much lower degree of protection we will talk about our machine later the main armament of the german is a smoothbore gun of mm caliber the range of aimed fire is km in motion km the sight for this tank wa developed by zeiss however it may not be needed fire control system only allow the gunner to select a target and impose a marker on it the tank will do the rest itself the engine of the leopard with a capacity of hp with a weight of ton on the highway the tank can be accelerated to km h and along the field up to km h but there are leopard and disadvantage the tank is large and it is more difficult to hide it than russian vehicle the leopard ha a large gun mask hitting it doe not leave the tank without a gun and a huge gunner s sight which creates a vulnerable zone in the frontal armor another drawback is the general booking the most vulnerable is the hull and the most durable place is the left side of the forehead of the tower in general this is a very serious machine the combat capability of which cannot be belittled well a next to the leopard look like it main competitor our t the russian modernized t tank aka breakthrough in term of protection and armament is much superior to the main german leopard the only thing in which the t loses is in the power plant the engine power is le than that of the german horse but on the other hand it is lighter weight up to ton the advantage of the russian tank is in the power of the gun it is of mm caliber and the t can conduct aimed fire at a distance of km almost twice a far a the leopard in this case the german tank may not have time to approach the russian one on the battlefield the t ha powerful anti shell armor but in addition to traditional armor and dynamic protection the tank is equipped with the shtora complex this is protection against anti tank guided missile there is also a system for installing curtain of external camouflage among the russian tank already in service the most protected is the t m the frontal armor of it turret will withstand the hit of the most sophisticated american shell of abrams tank who else besides the leopard can appear on the battlefield in the ukrainian steppe what are their advantage and weakness let s take a quick look at them u s abrams tank this is a very serious opponent dignity high rate of fire of a mm gun up to round per minute powerful armor of the frontal part of the vehicle navigation and friend or foe identification system the crew see through space satellite on their electronic map all the tank on the battlefield and most importantly which of them is their own ammunition is stored in a protected compartment this increase the survivability of the machine and crew powerful engine hp gas turbine provides quick start and acceleration modern electronics excellent mean of observation disadvantage side with weak armor vulnerable even to old grenade launcher and the rear of the tank is even for bmp gun there are no guided weapon unlike most modern tank which reduces the range of fire it is possible to defeat the turret of the auxiliary power plant on the stern even with a large caliber machine gun the inability to control an anti aircraft machine gun from the turret easily hit from above by high precision ammunition abrams is a serious but extremely heavy machine heavier than all it classmate weight reach ton american claim that thanks to this the abrams is better protected his armor is considered the best in the class well the american have all the best in the world but it s mostly on the front of the tank and anti tank missile are used a a rule on the side where the armor is thinner for example yemen s houthi rebel shot down at least abrams due to the heavy weight the tank ha the smallest power reserve it is extremely voracious of the significant advantage of the abrams it armor piercing shell are more effective they were developed recently and ours under the ussr the big advantage of russian tank is that they are two or three time cheaper the export value of the t s is million and the t m up to million while the new western tank cost at least million abrams about million so far they have only been tested in combat in the middle east in the sand and in ukraine now it is winter snow ice or impassable mud there is a video on the internet of abrams unable to enter a snow covered hill and slide backwards however when the ground dry up and hardens in the spring the abrams may frolic but one of russia s leading military expert viktor murakhovsky is convinced that nato tank are ill suited for combat in ukraine of the territory of ukraine is considered a closed area with a line of sight range of le than meter the share of distance up to and meter account for only of the territory in addition not all tank of nato country unlike russian one are equipped with dynamic protection against cumulative ammunition given these two factor western tank will confidently penetrate from russian gun german combat armored vehicle marder dignity strong armor for this class of vehicle it is designed to protect against mm russian gun that are on our main bmp good cross country ability and maneuverability decent armament mm automatic cannon machine gun and anti tank missile disadvantage the machine is heavy up to ton the armor on the side made it impossible for the paratrooper to fire from the vehicle very expensive and difficult to maintain infantry fighting vehicle bradley usa advantage experience ha shown that the aluminum armor of the vehicle is reliable and withstands the hit of soviet mm shell the mm automatic gun allows you to effectively deal with lightly armored target and provide fire support to the infantry bradley ha a good installation of tow homing missile capable of reaching any observed tank within a radius of km disadvantage high maintenance cost the machine is heavy ton by weight it approach tank poor permeability and stability number of paratrooper people with crew member the ratio is nowhere worse compared to our ifvs the car is hefty and this is a disadvantage on the battlefield this cannot be taken away the stryker is an s armoured fighting vehicle dignity armor protects the crew from mm bullet from the side and stern and mm shell from the forehead bulletproof tire are equipped with a pumping system a system of digital data exchange between machine and unit immediately seven periscope and a display of thermal imaging and video camera disadvantage too large size with little volume inside armor doe not hold modern anti tank weapon the challenger is a british main tank dignity one of the most protected tank in the world turret of improved design reduced radar visibility mm gun with chrome plating of the barrel channel which increased it resource disadvantage low reliability of the machine inconvenience of the crew archaic fire control system the main french tank leclerc dignity maneuverability thanks to the powerful force v engine and automatic transmission high degree of automation of system electronic stuffing half the cost of the tank armor is modular which simplifies the replacement of damaged element the roof of the tower is heavily protected the fire control system take into account all possible correction including the bending of the barrel disadvantage the car is capricious the electronics often fail now the french army ha tank but only of them are on the go the rest are mothballed because there is no money to maintain them there is no dynamic protection the french abandoned it arguing that it wa a danger to their own infantry the leclerc ha a stabilized mm smoothbore gun which give a greater initial velocity of the projectile but the resource of the gun is only round how can we destroy all these abrams leopard challenger and leclers well with them the whole brood of nato ifvs our modern t tank immediately come to mind well and the upgraded t b but a tank duel when a tank go against a tank a in the kursk arc is a rarity in modern battle all this will be done during the general battle under the cover of our combat vehicle supporting bmpt tank with the formidable name terminator it ha laser guided anti tank missile attack and grenade launcher dangerous for the latest nato tank and russian armor piercing and subcaliber shell lead made of uranium alloy they are capable of penetrating mm of steel armor this is the forehead of the abrams turret and le protected tank leopard challenger or leclerc will be hit even more often the russian army now ha about tank that can use such shell well what else are we going to spoil western military equipment alexander kochetkov reserve colonel design engineer we have an impressive set of anti tank weapon but most of them are half a century old for example the a gun adopted in or the rapira anti tank gun created in the late s you will laugh but with skillful use shell from them can hole the barrel of the most modern nato tank there are of course other mean to combat the abrams and leopard they can even be hit head on by anti tank missile vikhr which are on ka helicopter they are capable of penetrating armor up to mm and there are also attack v missile that penetrate up to mm of armor a serious danger for nato zhelezyak and anti tank complex kornet d for example the bmp m launch it missile in a salvo a a result the active protection of the enemy tank will shoot down the first missile and the second will hit the target our rpg hook hand grenade launcher work according to the same scheme for combat at short distance up to meter he s not bad for battling the bradley the strykers or the marders we have a set of reliable old men and more or le modern mean bassoon baby contest metis sturm and this without taking into account the promising development that are being prepared for adoption into service right now at an accelerated pace the situation obliges and here the question inevitably arises is it possible to destroy nato tank on the approach to the front line a tank is not a matchbox it is difficult to hide however hitting kalibr on echelon with military equipment or highway with tractor is not so easy caliber hit standing target not moving one is there no solution to the problem probably is these are massive strike on major railway junction through which train will flow from the west to ukraine and finally the release of sabotage group that will derail train with military equipment the situation will inevitably force u to look for the most effective option and the goal is clear to make nato supply to ukraine meaningless question of the day when can nato s tank armada reach the battlefield it is already sliding into poland in small batch training of ukrainian crew is underway recently a polish officer on camera admitted that his colleague were persuaded to sign a contract to go to fight in tank in ukraine there are few applicant but the signal is alarming it is obvious that ukrainian general and their adviser from the united state and britain will not smear armor along all kilometer of the line of combat contact they create an iron fist or fist in the most important direction the most obvious is in the zaporozhye direction with an eye to approach the crimea when ukraine will launch it promised offensive by spring or by summer it is still difficult to say most likely when thousand of ukrainian soldier finish training abroad and all the military equipment promised to kiev will be in the combat zone and here the central question arises do we have enough strength to stop this tank wedge break it all depends on our readiness to meet the enemy remember how a year ago they were afraid of turkish bayraktar drone they seemed to be the king of pr and the master on the battlefield but having met with the prepared military force in the svo zone they quickly deflated who remembers them now you can t hear them similarly abrams leopard and other bradley are now being sold the russian army ha the opportunity to reset the glory of this iron zoo of nato it s up to u from a simple russian soldier and a russian officer listen a well elite troop of the armed force of ukraine go to the side of russia more the decision by germany and the united state to send battle tank to ukraine reversing month of resistance on wednesday prompted additional pledge from across europe and prediction of victory over russia but it may be month before the tank rumble across the battlefield these can help ukraine to defend itself win and prevail a an independent nation said jens stoltenberg nato s secretary general soon to be a regular sight prowling the field of ukraine britain s defense ministry crowed in a twitter post with a photo of a german leopard tank and a british made challenger tank chewing up a muddy training field in poland but not that soon ukrainian troop still need to be trained to use the powerful western war machine and moving them into the conflict zone is far from an easy task the tank that were promised by berlin and washington will not be delivered until spring or summer at the earliest not in time to help ukraine defend hotly contested town and city near bakhmut in the country s east where russian force have been recently advancing in a grueling ground assault the more immediate payoff from the announcement on wednesday may be in providing a pathway for about a dozen other european country to donate their own german made leopard s to ukraine a step that would not have been taken without berlin s consent and a parallel promise by washington to contribute it m abrams tank sending the abrams appears to have been the key to unlocking the leopard which will probably get to ukraine much faster said sophia besch an expert on european defense issue at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington here is a look at what happens next the biggest donation is coming from the united state m abrams enough to supply one ukrainian military battalion the abrams is one of the most sophisticated tank system in the world but it requires specific training technology for it part and generally on specialized fuel to keep it running dependably on wednesday american official said it would be at least month before the abrams could be delivered and would not elaborate although other expert said it could take at least a year britain germany and poland have each committed to sending tank with london predicting delivery of it challenger s within week germany s defense minister boris pistorius forecast it would take berlin three or four month to ship it leopard tank poland ha signaled it is already prepared to send it own leopard tank to ukraine portugal ha said it could give four leopard s and norway ha said it could send eight more other pledge to give leopard s but without specifying how many have been made by spain finland and the netherlands and france is considering giving ukraine an unspecified number of it leclerc battle tank additionally denmark ha said it could send swiss made piranha tank to ukraine once the government in bern agrees they could be re exported a process that moved forward last weekend after being stalled for month in all that mean at least western tank have been committed in principle at least ukrainian military official have long said they need at least western tank to make a difference in the war that is a lot of tank at the national level according to an analysis on wednesday by janes the london based intelligence firm european military are holding at least leopard tank and hundred of other kind of western battle tank the russian also have thousand of tank still available in what ha become a war of rapid attrition said david silbey a military historian at cornell university who specializes in battlefield analysis the west will never manage a one to one match for those number mr silbey said but given the quality advantage of the leopard or abrams over even the most modern russian tank if the west could supply to tank it would make a massive difference to the ukrainian and to the war some will be arriving in british training camp in the coming day to start training on the challenger tank that london committed to this month according to vadym prystaiko ukraine s ambassador to the united kingdom some former military official and expert have challenged claim mostly by the united state that it could take month to train ukraine s force to use the tank they note that the ukrainian troop selected to crew them will have already been trained on soviet era tank so learning to operate the leopard tank which run on diesel fuel and are easier to operate than m abrams could take only three to four week to achieve a basic proficiency the international institute for strategic study said this month american official who briefed journalist on condition of anonymity on wednesday described a far more complicated process for the m abrams involving training not just for operating the tank but also for maintaining them part of that process will involve building a stable supply chain to ensure the tank are getting the fuel part and other assistance they would need on the front line while the abrams may not arrive on the battlefield for what one u s official described a some time training ukrainian troop to use them will begin quickly already american troop in germany are training ukrainian force on a range of combined and coordinated weapon including armored combat vehicle dwindling supply of ammunition have been a bane for ukraine s force almost since the start of the war reliant a they are on diminishing store of munition that fit their soviet era tank and other weapon captured russian tank have been an essential stop gap for ukraine but spare part for them are often hard to acquire according to ukrainian soldier the western made tank use ammunition that is compatible with nato stock meaning that they could be replenished by any of the member state of the military alliance or their partner the tank will be delivered with some extra ammunition supply still the war ha so drained western stockpile that some ally are growing nervous about whether they will have enough for other potential conflict or even their own self defense while the new western tank are essential for any future ukrainian offensive operation they may prove a headache for ukraine s legion of supply officer the german and american tank have different part and maintenance regime and both fire type of ammunition different from those of the soviet era tank that ukraine currently field the process of delivering western weapon and other military equipment to ukraine ha been one of the most heavily guarded secret of the war concern that russia will target road railway or staging ground for the mat riel ha required what official and expert described a stealthy convoy usually disguised or cloaked in darkness to evade attack former western military official and expert described a patchwork of delivery route largely originating from hub in poland slovakia and germany that will be crucial to getting tank armored fighting vehicle and huge gun to the front line most of the weapon will be shipped either on rail car or flatbed truck that are strong enough to carry their huge weight rail is generally the fastest and safest way to move armor expert said given that long convoy of flatbed truck would most likely attract russia s attention it would take too much time fuel and spare part to drive the tank and other armored vehicle to the battlefield expert said they would also become in essence a moving target for russian warplane the risk are so daunting and worry over provoking russia are so high that instead of western force or contractor delivering them to the conflict zone ukrainian troop are required to retrieve the weapon from depot in nato territory president biden on wednesday approved the u s to send abrams m tank to ukraine just hour after german chancellor olaf scholtz said ukraine would also receive leopard tank from berlin a russia plan for a major offensive this is about freedom freedom for ukraine freedom everywhere he added while leopard tank from eu nation will require minimal turnaround time and will serve the immediate need of ukraine s military force the shipment of abrams tank to ukraine will take month senior defense official would not confirm if the decision to send the battalion of abrams tank wa a stipulation of berlin s or motivation from washington to get the ball rolling on leopard tank the move wa instead championed a a show of long term support for ukraine the pentagon is also working through the fuel and maintenance requirement that the abram tank demand and the u s will also send eight m recovery vehicle in support of the top tank the u s ha already supplied thousand of combat vehicle including humvee and pledged earlier this month to send another armored vehicle of various type the abrams tank will be procured through the ukraine security assistance initiative and will not come directly from u s stockpile caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news german chancellor olaf scholz formally announced wednesday that after week of stalling and frustrating negotiation berlin ha agreed to send two battalion of leopard a tank to ukraine some other eu nation that posse the german made tank in their own stock and had increased the pressure on berlin in recent week to approve re export to ukraine a the war nears the month mark defense official have said it make better sense to employ ukraine with the german made tank a there are thousand of them throughout europe and training along with maintenance is far more manageable than on the more advanced abrams tank caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news yesterday germany and the u s pledged to send xa tank to ukraine after week of diplomatic maneuvering the pledge could unlock a wave of additional aid ahead of an expected escalation of fighting in the spring it could take a year or more for american m abrams tank xa to reach the battlefield but the u s promise did clear the way for

welcome to the russia ukraine war briefing your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict germany and the u s announced today that they would send battle tank to ukraine a move meant to unlock a wave of heavier aid to help ukrainian force beat back russian force president biden spoke just hour after chancellor olaf scholz said germany would send an initial shipment of leopard tank to ukraine and lift export restriction to allow other nation to send their own speaking at the white house biden said the u s would provide abrams tank addressing germany s insistence that it would not supply the weaponry unless the u s did the same in recent week the dispute with germany had turned bitter exposing division within nato some german politician and european leader argued that berlin wa squandering a chance for leadership in europe and actively hindering it ally while the pledge fell far short of the tank that ukraine had said it needed to gain a decisive upper hand on the battlefield germany s announcement prompted finland the netherlands and spain to say that they would also send tank to ukraine or were open to doing so poland said yesterday that it wa seeking germany s permission to send leopard tank from it own stock britain ha pledged to send challenger tank with germany finally on board attention turned to getting the tank to the front line quickly it could take month for the first leopard to arrive on the battlefield and a year or longer for the abrams sending the armor ha the potential to be a game changer said daniel fried a former u s ambassador to poland but it depends on when they get there if you add up the tank plus the bradley plus the german marders plus the french armored vehicle once they all get there and are integrated into the ukrainian force the ukrainian are going to have a lot more punch the pentagon had been reluctant to send abrams tank in part because they are challenging to operate and maintain the leopard is a natural choice for ukraine because it is easier to operate and there are already hundred potentially available in europe after ukraine s russian made tank were destroyed or disabled in combat there were fewer replacement to be found my colleague john ismay who cover the pentagon told me along with the delivery of abrams and leopard tank nato nation also have stockpile of ammunition and spare part that ukrainian troop can use to keep them engaged in combat against russian force he said russia s ambassador to germany sergey nechayev warned that germany s move wa an extremely dangerous decision that take the conflict to a new level of confrontation the decision by the u s and germany will generate enough tank for about three new ukrainian battalion western official say that providing tank and other heavy weaponry to ukraine will prevent a long and static war that could favor russia s military follow our coverage of the war on the nytimes channel to provide comprehensive coverage of the war we often link to outside source some of these require a subscription in ukraine around the world we also recommend thanks for reading i ll be back friday carole with the precision of a military drill first germany and then the united state announced on wednesday that each had agreed to provide battle tank to help ukraine beat back russia s invading force in reaching a deal the two country extricated themselves from a diplomatic morass that had consumed the attention of western official for week and exposed division between ukraine s ally ukrainian leader with an eye on the tough battle widely assumed to lie ahead in the spring had urged germany to send it vaunted tank the leopard berlin resisted germany made clear it would proceed only if the united state sent it own powerful tank the m abrams washington resisted and all the while poland threatened to give ukraine the leopard from it own stock with or without germany s permission on wednesday resistance seemed a thing of the past these tank are further evidence of our enduring unflagging commitment to ukraine and our confidence in the skill of ukrainian force president biden declared at the white house hour earlier after germany announced that it would send leopard to ukraine and allow other nation to send their own chancellor olaf scholz defended his country s cautious approach we re talking about very effective weapon system here and it s proper that we never provide those weapon system alone but always in close cooperation mr scholz told lawmaker in parliament ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky who had campaigned vigorously for the tank embraced the news he called it an important step on the path to victory but if ukraine wa enjoying a cavalry is coming moment it wa clear that it would not be arriving any time soon the first leopard could take month to arrive on the battlefield and the abrams a year or longer the tank will also number far fewer than the hundred that ukraine say it need to defeat the russian but germany s decision to send tank from it own store pave the way for a dozen other european country to send their own a movement of heavy weaponry that could eventually help ukrainian force dent russia s advantage in troop number and equipment military expert say in all kyiv emerged from the agreement with enough tank for about three new ukrainian battalion the united state said it would send abrams tank and germany said it would send an initial shipment of leopard the announcement were welcomed by ukraine s ally at a critical moment in russia s war these can help ukraine to defend itself win and prevail a an independent nation said jens stoltenberg nato s secretary general prime minister mateusz morawiecki of poland said that the delivery of leopard wa a big step and britain s prime minister rishi sunak said germany had made the right decision the news got a much frostier reception from the kremlin sergey yuryevitch nechayev the russian ambassador to germany said in a statement that ukraine s ally had made an extremely dangerous decision that take the conflict to a new level of confrontation the statement also accused berlin of abandoning it historical responsibility to russia arising from nazi aggression in world war ii that history and the decade of relative pacifism that followed for germany played a significant role in it reluctance to send the tank for all the talk of a unified alliance that followed the tank announcement together we are stronger poland s prime minister trumpeted in the week before the deal wa struck there were sign that the ally might start to go their own way we will not stand idly by and watch ukraine bleed to death mr morawiecki said over the weekend ukraine and europe will win this war with or without germany legally germany ha to authorize the transfer of the tank it made from one country to another but poland s leader insisted that whether berlin approved or not warsaw would build a coalition of nation willing to donate some of europe s most advanced weaponry word of the tank agreement came on a day when ukrainian force suffered a setback on the battlefield retreating from the small town of soledar in the east after week of bitter fighting a military spokesman acknowledged that ukraine s withdrawal there brings russian force closer to encircling and perhaps capturing the strategic eastern city of bakhmut the spokesman col sergei cherevaty said that the retreat had been ordered to preserve our personnel with winter set in fighting in ukraine ha slowed considerably and many of the decision being made by ukrainian official and their ally now are based on the belief that a spring begin so will a new phase in the war the tank promised on wednesday by berlin and washington will not be delivered in time to help ukraine defend town and city near bakhmut where russian force have recently advanced in a grueling ground assault indeed it may be month before they are deployed moving them into the conflict zone is far from an easy task and ukrainian troop still need to be trained to use the powerful western war machine the abrams tank in particular is an exceptionally complex machine that is challenging to operate and maintain gen robert b abrams a former u s army four star general who retired in with decade of experience the tank is named for his father echoed other expert concern about logistics some pentagon leader say it will be difficult for ukrainian troop to repair and maintain a fleet of the gas guzzling tank and that is after getting them there the time it would take to get there to be able to build up the supply stockage to deliver the vehicle to train the crew to train the mechanic to gather everything you d need how long would that take general abrams said in an interview i don t know but it ain t like day i can tell you that on wednesday when a reporter asked if germany had forced him to change his mind on the tank mr biden said germany didn t force me to change my mind i wanted to make sure we are all together he also dismissed moscow s contention that sending the tank wa an escalation there is no offensive threat to russia mr biden said if russian troop return to russia where they belong this war would be over today washington president biden s announcement wednesday that he would send m abrams tank to ukraine came after week of tense back channel negotiation with the chancellor of germany and other european leader who insisted that the only way to unlock a flow of heavy european arm wa for the united state to send tank of it own his decision however reluctant now pave the way for german made leopard tank to be delivered to ukraine in two or three month provided by several european nation while it is unclear whether it will make a decisive difference in the spring offensive that president volodymyr zelensky is now planning to take back territory seized by russia it is the latest in a series of gradual escalation that ha inched the united state and it nato ally closer to direct conflict with russia in interview european and american official acknowledged that three month ago it would have been inconceivable that mr biden chancellor olaf scholz of germany and leader of other european nation would have contributed such heavy arm but over time they argued the battlefield ha changed and they believed the threat that president vladimir v putin would reach for a tactical nuclear weapon to eviscerate ukrainian force ha diminished moreover they said they wanted to demonstrate to mr putin that his bet that european unity would fracture over the winter had failed and that nato remained committed to the war even in the face of gas and oil cutoff and fear that russian cyberattacks would cripple european infrastructure putin expected europe and the united state to weaken our resolve mr biden said at the white house flanked by secretary of state antony j blinken and his defense secretary lloyd j austin iii he added these tank are further evidence of our enduring unflagging commitment to ukraine and our confidence in the skill of ukrainian force only last week mr austin dismissed the idea of sending the abrams tank with his aide saying it long tail of supply and repair vehicle xa wa too complex for the stretched ukrainian force to operate the no official in the pentagon colin h kahl said last week that the abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment adding we should not be providing the ukrainian system they can t repair they can t sustain and that they over the long term can t afford because it s not helpful but by promising abrams tank which john f kirby the national security council spokesman said would take many month to be built by general dynamic mr biden wa able to give mr scholz political cover to send leopard tank by early spring and germany s decision opened the way for spain poland and finland to do the same with norway likely next to announce a similar contribution but mr biden wa clearly sensitive to the suggestion that he had been forced into the decision by one of his closest ally he cast the xa issue a one of preserving unity we wanted to make sure we were all together mr biden said the european leopard though they come in many version that use different type of ammunition are considered lighter and more agile than the abrams tank and better suited to the coming counteroffensive that will require ukrainian force to breach line of russian dug trench a situation more akin to world war i battlefield in europe for which the tank wa invented mr biden often say he ha two goal to liberate ukraine and to avoid direct conflict between american and russian force increasingly those two goal are in tension on wednesday mr biden insisted that the new firepower wa intended to defend ukrainian territory and nothing more there is no offensive threat to russia he said if russian troop return to russia where they belong this war would be over today the russian viewed it differently to no one s surprise the russian ambassador to the united state anatoly antonov spent much of the day on social medium suggesting a broader american plot saying it is all about u s proxy war with our country both mr biden and mr scholz were worried about the proxy war imagery though for different reason mr biden worry about escalation in private conversation mr scholz made the case that even eight decade after world war ii european nation would be uncomfortable seeing german tank rumbling into battle even in the cause of liberating ukrainian territory after a call last week with mr scholz who is still finding his footing a the leader of western europe s biggest power mr biden began to relent he told the pentagon to set aside it many objection that the abrams tank wa ill suited to ukraine s need and far too hard to operate and maintain for it stressed force it wa a triumph of political calculation over logistical concern it made no sense to the pentagon to go through the logistical headache of sending the country s most advanced tank to ukraine when there were very capable german leopard tank nearby that could get to ukraine faster and operate more efficiently on top of that several european country including spain poland and finland were willing to send their german leopard tank if germany would only agree a legal requirement that came with their original acquisition of their german made equipment in senior biden administration meeting mr austin and gen mark a milley chairman of the joint chief of staff laid out the pentagon position in subsequent interview white house national security official dutifully repeated the military talking point about why the abrams did not make sense while european tank did but mr austin and general milley are charged with giving mr biden their best military advice in this case it clashed with the need to preserve unity among the ally what the pentagon wa not taking into enough account one official said wa the intense fear among european government of doing anything to provoke russia without having the cover of the united state doing the same thing first like it or not that mean the united state remains the glue that hold nato and europe together said peter juul a national security analyst in the newsletter the liberal patriot at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week mr scholz wa clear according to several people who heard him that he would not agree to send leopard tank until the united state agreed to send it abrams american official at first thought he could be persuaded otherwise and hoped that a commitment by britain to send challenger tank which have different operational requirement would move him to do the same it did not a german official made clear to mr austin and general milley during a meeting on friday of more than ally at ramstein air base in germany after the meeting failed to produce germany s approval to deploy it tank the ensuing medium report pointed to the division a the biggest crack in nato unity since the start of the ukraine war some european official argue that the split wa overblown and that the tank are le likely to provide a game changing difference in the coming offensive missile defense and precision guided rocket like the himars system the united state ha sent to ukraine are more effective they argue but a often happens the tank a weapon easy for anyone to understand resonant of war past became a litmus test and after a year of using nato unity a one of the biden administration s key talking point about russian failure in the war in ukraine senior administration official realized that it wa time for politics to trump the pentagon s objection it seems that the issue all along ha been a political not military one said evelyn farkas the pentagon s senior official for ukraine in the obama administration and our military leader should have greenlighted the abrams long ago to provide reinforcement to the german that collective security would prevail what is stunning about it is how afraid our ally are about facing russia without the united state she added mr austin himself arrived at that conclusion after the meeting in germany ended without a decision on the german tank according to aide telling associate that he did not see the sense of risking a fracture in nato or a rift with germany over the issue some pentagon official were taken aback that german official were publicly admitting the link between the abrams tank and the leopard one official said speaking on condition of anonymity to discus internal deliberation he added that official had thought those communication would only be internal by monday official said both mr austin and general milley were onboard with sending american tank to germany to make the point or to be seen making the point mr austin called mr biden on monday to recommend sending the abrams tank while some lawmaker had suggested the united state needed to send a few a a single abrams tank to unlock the german leopard the pentagon leader said that made no sense if the united state wa going to send it most advanced tank system it should send a battalion with combat power one official said a ukrainian battalion ha tank so that wa the amount the united state agreed to send pentagon official said several detail still need to be worked out the army ha not yet decided which specific type of abrams tank it will deliver douglas r bush an army assistant secretary told reporter on wednesday the army ha tank in it inventory that might need to be revamped but they will not need to be built from scratch by general dynamic the army ha more than abrams tank either ready to fight or in various state of partial construction that could be retrofitted for use in ukraine the army must decide between variant of the abrams tank that have different electronics and a different gun turret mr bush said a decision to be made by senior pentagon official in the coming week procuring the tank will take month official said giving the u s military time to train ukrainian soldier how to operate and maintain them it wa unclear whether training would take place in germany the united state or both pentagon official said on wednesday any american battle tank sent to ukraine will be destroyed by russian force moscow s ambassador to the united state ha warned after medium report said the white house now plan to supply kiev with heavy armor despite it previous refusal asked about the potential shipment of the m abrams main battle tank to ukraine russia s ambassador to the u anatoly antonov said the move would only escalate american involvement in the conflict and go far beyond offering defensive weapon if a decision to transfer to kiev m abrams is made american tank without any doubt will be destroyed a all other sample of nato military equipment the envoy said adding that the american are constantly raising the bar of military assistance to their puppet government read more u change stance on sending tank to ukraine cnn though the white house previously rejected kiev s demand for the m abrams which wa featured on a christmas wish list circulated by ukrainian official around the holiday on tuesday multiple news outlet reported that washington had reversed course and now intends to send the hardware after all an announcement could come a early a this week the report said while the pentagon had argued that the abrams is costly to operate and maintain and could take year to reach the battlefield official now believe it is necessary to agree to supply the vehicle in order to persuade germany to allow for shipment of it own leopard battle tank according to the new york time the leopard is in use by several european military with around unit stationed across the continent though berlin must authorize their re export to any third country ambassador antonov noted that u official frequently preview information in the press before confirming it on record suggesting tuesday s report about the m abrams were yet another example of a deliberate leak he added that washington is using ukraine a a proxy in order to inflict strategic defeat on u claiming the u ha been the true instigator of hostility if the united state decides to supply tank it will be impossible to justify such a step using argument about defensive weapon this would be another blatant provocation against the russian federation he said no one should have illusion about who the real aggressor is in the current conflict read more western tank won t be game changer in ukraine kremlin moscow ha repeatedly urged against western intervention in the conflict arguing that the stream of military hardware pouring into ukraine ha only prolonged fighting and made a negotiated settlement impossible nonetheless the kremlin ha said that no amount of foreign largesse would stop it from achieving it objective and pledged that all nato weapon sent to ukraine would burn the german government ha changed it stance on leopard main battle tank delivery to ukraine giving in to mounting pressure from it ally berlin pledged to send in a company strong number of tank itself while allowing other european nation to deliver german made armor from their stock a well this decision follows our well known line of supporting ukraine to the best of our ability we are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally german chancellor olaf scholz announced on wednesday size of looming leopard force revealedberlin ha promised to approve re export permit for third country in possession of leopard tank a well a to begin training ukrainian crew in germany shortly the german government said the outstanding goal wa to quickly create two tank battalion equipped with armored vehicle of this type for the ukrainian military the plan also envisions logistics and maintenance support a well a delivery of ammunition for the tank the vehicle however will only arrive in ukraine after three or four month the country s new defense minister boris pistorius ha said what did germany pledge to deliver berlin itself ha pledged to deliver a company sized tank force from bundeswehr stock comprising leopard a tank one of the latest variant of the combat vehicle the number is well below the announced plan to create a two battalion strong force typically made up of some vehicle the rest is expected to be delivered by other european nation operating tank of this type at the same time leopard manufacturer german arm giant rheinmetall said over the weekend it wa in possession of some older leopard a tank which may potentially end up being supplied to ukraine a well the company said it ha leopard a tank in it inventory which are being overhauled a part of berlin s weapon transfer program with other european nation and will be operational by april or may an additional batch of vehicle requires more work and would be ready in about a year what other country will send leopard tank so far only poland ha officially confirmed plan to send older leopard a to ukraine with warsaw even threatening to do so without berlin s approval shortly before germany gave in to international pressure on the issue another leopard operator spain said it wa willing to cooperate with it ally and do whatever is necessary to deliver leopard to ukraine a similar message wa sent by the netherlands which said no decision had been made yet but a potential delivery wa certainly not ruled out the country doe not actually own leopard tank instead it lease of them from germany and now it is considering buying those vehicle to donate them to kiev sweden which operates it own variant of leopard a stridsvagn said it may send in some of it tank at a later stage a well norway and portugal each operating around leopard tank are considering providing some of their vehicle a well according to local medium report ukraine celebrates tank pledgekiev ha long demanded more military hardware from it western backer including leopard tank and the change of heart in berlin ha been welcomed by top ukrainian official the first step on tank ha been taken next one the tank coalition we need a lot of leopard the head of ukraine s presidency andrey yermak wrote on telegram moscow blast the extremely dangerous movemoscow ha condemned berlin s decision with russia s ambassador to germany sergey nechayev saying the delivery of leopard tank clearly show that germany and it closest ally are not interested in a diplomatic solution in ukraine but are set on it permanent escalation instead and will continue the unlimited pumping of ukraine with new deadly weapon this extremely dangerous decision take the conflict to a new level of confrontation and contradicts the statement of german politician about germany s unwillingness to get involved in it nechayev said in a statement published on the embassy s website u president joe biden could formally launch the process of sending american battle tank to ukraine for use in the conflict with russia a soon a wednesday unnamed u official have told reuters the biden administration ha reversed it decision not to provide kiev with m abrams tank under pressure from the zelensky government two source who spoke to the agency on tuesday have claimed the lethal aid will likely be funded under the so called ukraine security assistance initiative usai which allows the u government to purchase arm directly from the defense industry while leaving existing u military stock intact according to one of the official washington could buy dozen of u made tank from it ally refurbish them and then send them to ukraine however he warned it could be a long process taking month or year several u news outlet have corroborated report that the white house is about to greenlight delivery of m abrams with politico claiming some tank are being considered for ukraine read more u change stance on sending tank to ukraine cnn the alleged softening of the u stance follows report in the german medium on tuesday that chancellor olaf scholz ha finally agreed to provide kiev with enough leopard s to equip a tank company which usually consists of vehicle on sunday german foreign minister annalena baerbock also said that if other country like poland officially ask for permission to supply leopard s to the zelensky government berlin would not stand in the way germany had earlier been reluctant to send it tank to ukraine despite pressure from ally insisting that washington should do the same however publicly the u continues to insist that m abrams won t be the best solution for the conflict in ukraine due to the ton tank being difficult to maintain running on jet fuel and requiring lengthy training to operate the m is a complex weapon system that is challenging to maintain that wa true yesterday that is true today and will be true in the future pentagon spokesperson brigadier general pat ryder reiterated on tuesday read more u tank will be destroyed in ukraine moscow russian ambassador to the u anatoly antonov said that if they do occur the delivery of u tank to kiev would be another blatant provocation against moscow by washington which is the real aggressor in the conflict in ukraine american tank without any doubt will be destroyed a will be all other sample of nato military equipment that were given to the ukrainian military the envoy warned echoing an earlier statement by the kremlin a member of parliament from the alternative for germany afd party ha accused chancellor olaf scholz of undermining one of the fundamental principle of germany s foreign policy since the end of world war ii petr bystron s criticism came in response to scholz s decision to provide ukraine with leopard tank addressing the chancellor in the german parliament on wednesday bystron argued that scholz would go down in history a a leader who had negated the never again tenet long espoused by berlin according to the afd lawmaker this principle wa taken to mean among other thing abstention from weapon export to conflict zone he went on to remind fellow mp and the chancellor that germany bear special responsibility for the victim of world war ii including those in the soviet union bystron suggested that scholz s latest decision wa in stark contrast to the legacy of his great social democratic predecessor such a willy brant and helmut schmidt who had done a lot for peace and reconciliation million of german citizen are asking themselves why what for did you do that the afd politician claimed read more germany greenlights leopard tank for ukraine bystron went on to allege that by deciding to supply military hardware to kiev scholz had gone back on his own campaign promise and gone against the majority of the country the mp also questioned just how much difference tank would make on the battlefield in ukraine responding to the criticism scholz acknowledged that germany had indeed departed from the principle set out by brant and schmidt this however wa solely the result of russia attacking ukraine according to the chancellor he accused moscow of waging an imperialist war earlier on wednesday chancellor scholz announced the decision to ship leopard a tank from it own stock to kiev he argued that this follows our well known line of supporting ukraine to the best of our ability the statement represented a major u turn a berlin had long resisted call to donate the armor despite growing pressure from it ally russian official claim western weapon delivery to ukraine only serve to unnecessarily prolong the conflict and could lead to a direct confrontation between nato and russia on the air of radio komsomolskaya pravda with military expert teacher of the higher school of economics andrei frolov we discussed the danger of supplying tank from the united state and europe to the kiev regime in the near future a well a when to wait for these armored vehicle in the svo zone russian ambassador to the united state anatoly antonov warned the american that if they deliver their abrams tank to kiev they will be destroyed and at what stage they are going to destroy our diplomat most likely meant the destruction on the battlefield hardly during the railway delivery of armored vehicle through poland and the north western region of ukraine the essence of the statement i believe wa that several dozen abrams would not change the situation in the svo zone in favor of kiev if we are talking about abrams from which biden mentioned this may not be serious but then it is only an excuse a go ahead to the ally for the supply of more than a hundred leopard collected from all over europe it s not about but about fifty abrams a reported by politico but delivery date are also important and for now it is said that this will happen within a year or even only in a year however the same wa said about the leopard then there will be few of them then they will allegedly not be sent soon but all this is happening a part of the information preparation for the fact that tank will come to kiev and for u the fact of sending the abrams may be the most unpleasant why it s not about the reasoning that the american will allegedly supply heavy armored vehicle in penny quantity in fact they will transfer a lot at once it is important that along with this the necessary repair and evacuation equipment will be immediately transferred and of course complete set of spare part and i would look at this threat more closely than i would look at the leopard so within a year or a year delivery are still different thing about the fact that in a year they say out loud today and they said about the patriot air defense system that kiev would never have them then they said that they would not be soon and now ukrainian are being trained to work on these anti aircraft missile system and in ukraine these system are expected from day to day it s a similar story with tank they will certainly be delivered however there is one but what the final decision on the timing and number of vehicle will be made based on the situation on the battlefield in the coming week a maximum of a month and a half if the armed force of ukraine in the svo zone find themselves in a situation close to capitulation then no abrams will be supplied to kiev if kiev somehow manages to withstand russian pressure until spring then american tank may end up in ukraine in a short time for example in march april and nato country have enough leopard stock for serious tank delivery to kiev there is a nuance here leopard are supplied not from german factory but actually from combat unit the peak of their mass production ha passed a long time ago yes they are still produced but in rather limited quantity their latest modification are very expensive and they produce car mainly for export ukraine will be given early old modification their reserve are quite large more than a thousand in europe and berlin no longer forbids other country to transfer them to kiev but the question arises what to replace and will it be possible to do it in a short time the answer to the second question is no listen a well elite troop of the armed force of ukraine go to the side of russia more berlin ha changed it stance on delivery of leopard main battle tank to ukraine finally agreeing to send in the hardware der spiegel reported on tuesday citing anonymous source according to the weekly german chancellor olaf scholz ha agreed to provide kiev with enough armored vehicle to equip a tank company while the outlet did not specify an exact number a company is usually comprised of at least tank the looming delivery is expected to involve one of the latest variant of the combat vehicle namely leopard a tank the vehicle in question will come from germany s bundeswehr stock der spiegel noted the financial time also reported on berlin s decision citing source familiar with the matter earlier on tuesday a representative of german arm giant rheinmetall told redaktionsnetzwerk deutschland rnd news website that the group could provide some leopard variant to ukraine with a batch of leopard a expected to be ready in about a year read more german tank maker reveals possible number for kiev rheinmetall also ha an additional leopard a tank in it inventory which are being overhauled a part of berlin s weapon transfer program with other european nation those vehicle are nearly operational and are expected to be ready by april or may the company could also provide older leopard tank according to the representative who did not provide any timeframe for when the armored vehicle produced in the s would be operational

reversing it longstanding resistance the biden administration plan to send m abrams tank to ukraine u s official said on tuesday in what would be a major step in arming kyiv in it effort to seize back it territory from russia the white house is expected to announce a decision a early a wednesday said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussion two official said the number of abrams tank could be about over the past month pentagon official had expressed misgiving about sending the abrams citing concern about how ukraine would maintain the advanced tank which require extensive training and servicing and official said it could take year for them to actually reach any ukrainian battlefield but defense secretary lloyd j austin iii ha now come around to the view that committing to sending american tank is necessary to spur germany to follow with it coveted leopard tank official at the state department and the white house argued that giving germany the political cover it sought to send it own tank outweighed the defense department s reluctance the official said the movement toward sending the abrams tank first reported by the wall street journal follows a testy confrontation last week during a nato defense chief meeting over the refusal by germany s chancellor olaf scholz to send the leopard which many military expert believe could be a critical weapon in ukrainian hand german official privately insisted that they would send the tank among the most advanced in the world only if the united state agreed to send it own m abrams tank anticipation for a german announcement wa high a various german news outlet reported on tuesday that mr scholz had decided to send the tank much of the attention focused on an expected address by the chancellor to parliament on wednesday many european country use german built leopard which number about across the continent and ukraine ha pleaded for tank in recent week describing them a necessary to counter russia s advantage in arm and men western tank are the latest barrier to fall a ukraine s ally supply it with weapon system they had previously resisted sending earlier this month while debate over the leopard and the abrams wore on britain said it would give some of it challenger tank on tuesday poland s defense minister said his country had formally requested germany s permission to send ukraine leopard tank from it own stock and other country have indicated they would do the same if germany agreed in kyiv finland s president sauli niinisto told reporter at a news conference that he had discussed the supply of western tank to ukraine with president volodymyr zelensky it wa not immediately clear what prompted the biden administration s shift a recently a monday a pentagon official told reporter that the abrams tank would be difficult for ukrainian force to maintain in part because they run on jet fuel but the decision to send a relatively small number of tank and the expected delay in delivery could outweigh concern about escalating the war while providing political benefit for the administration defense official have repeatedly used the fuel issue to explain in part why the administration wa not sending the abrams tank to kyiv but while it is true that xa the tank have gas turbine engine that burn jet fuel it is not the whole story tank expert say abrams tank they say can run on any type of fuel including ordinary gasoline and diesel the pentagon press secretary brig gen patrick ryder would not confirm news report on tuesday that the administration wa on the verge of providing ukraine with the m abrams tank when and if we have something to announce we will he said he called the abrams tank a very capable battlefield platform it s also very complex capability general ryder said and so like anything that we re providing to ukraine we want to ensure that they have the ability to maintain it sustain it to train on it he did not refer to the issue of fuel the administration had initially hoped that the british offer of challenger tank would be enough to get the german to agree to send their tank but mr scholz u s official said insisted on the abrams the official said that the abrams tank would be paid for through the ukraine security assistance package which provides funding for weapon to ukraine a second defense official said the lengthy delay in delivery would allow time for ukrainian troop to be trained on america s most advanced tank robert b abrams a former u s army armor officer and four star general who retired in said the effort would be herculean but not impossible the time it would take to get there to be able to build up the supply stockage to deliver the vehicle to train the crew to train the mechanic to gather everything you d need how long would that take xa general abrams who ha extensive experience in the m tank which wa named for his father gen creighton abrams said in an interview i don t know but it ain t like day i can tell you that after a series of ukrainian success on the battlefield last fall the war ha shifted to a grueling fight of attrition the most intense fighting is concentrated in eastern ukraine where russia and ukraine have taken heavy casualty around the city of bakhmut a both side prepare for expected spring offensive ukrainian official say they need tank to break through newly constructed russian defense and retake more territory seized by moscow early in the war and to defend against an expected russian offensive in the spring the united

boris pistorius said last week that his country would also begin to train ukrainian to use leopard tank despite the lack of agreement at the time on whether to send them it s to prepare for a day that will possibly come at which point we would be able to act immediately and deliver the support within a very short period of time he told reporter ukraine s ally have provided increasingly sophisticated arm to help kyiv defend against russia s invasion but they have been reluctant to send heavy offensive weapon for fear of provoking moscow since russia s full scale invasion began month ago they have tried to carefully calibrate their support which ha slowly grown to include howitzer himars rocket artillery system patriot air defense and most recently armored fighting vehicle including the stryker used by the u s military ukraine ha been begging for heavily armored western tank for month with official maintaining that the country s current inventory of soviet style tank is not enough to expel russian force when britain announced last week that it wa sending tank ukrainian official thanked the british government but said in a statement that the challenger were not sufficient to achieve operational goal germany s new defense minister ha said country in possession of leopard main battle tank should start training ukrainian troop on how to operate them even though

nato secretary general jens stoltenberg in berlin on tuesday the minister explained that berlin is looking at it own fleet of leopard s but it is not just a matter of counting the tank we know how

meaning of fast track instead if it mean changing the rule and procedure no because we believe in and defend the rule of law but if it mean that both party speed up the work following the rule step by step then of course ukraine s candidacy can be fast tracked he said moscow ha stated that it will not accept any outcome of the crisis in ukraine that fails to resolve it core security concern and that arming kiev with increasingly advanced weapon will only prolong the conflict and raise the risk of nuclear escalation some eu nation such a france have said that any future security architecture in europe will have to address russia s concern in order to be viable even before the meeting of nato defense minister at an air base in germany the united state opened map showed the ally what mountain of weapon and ammunition they decided to provide to ukraine kp on the eve told about this well this is about the same a it happens at the meeting of thief in law the rich leader of the gang will throw a thick pile of money on a tray for the injured colleague and then vigilantly watch who will give more no one gave more american and no one expected this washington with it military budget of billion and this is more than all nato country combined may not afford it he is a perennial world champion in this regard opening the meeting at the u military base in germany in ramshatin u secretary of defense lloyd austin boasted a mass of u military equipment for the armed force of ukraine this is unprecedented and then he explained why it wa being done the new aid package will strengthen ukraine s air defense system protect their sky and civilian we will also strengthen their defense on the battlefield also a part of the package of assistance to ukraine combat vehicle will be transferred bradley strykers and other armored vehicle we are also talking about artillery shell and other ammunition the united state is determined to set an example for how to help ukraine the u s ha also given the ukrainian military the skill it need to be more effective on the battlefield our european partner have joined u the united state will continue to increase financial assistance prioritizing cooperation with the armed force of ukraine pay attention to the keywords in this tirade show example it s do a i do in another way curiously if the american both before and after the meeting in ramstein trumpeted their arm supply to kiev then it other participant and there were about of them in total including pocket nato ally were modestly silent perhaps there wa such an agreement so a not to frighten the taxpayer of their country with the scale of the weapon dump president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky published a video in his telegram channel in which he commented on the result of the meeting in ramstein and clearly tried to smooth out what wa expected but did not receive in kiev by announcing the total scale of arm supply to ukraine that wa the hope for an impressive propaganda chip they say look the world in solidarity overwhelms u with weapon but ramstein s organizer didn t want to do that and there wa a special reason for that closed door to the meeting leaked the scream and complaint of some nato defence minister that the transfer of military equipment wa seriously depleting the arsenal of national army and undermining their readiness zelensky clearly hid his disappointment from the fact that the final figure of arm supply to kiev were not announced and slyly smeared the nato leadership it is not always possible to publicly announce what is being discussed in the ramstein format it s a closed discussion and it should be but the same zelensky urged the participant of the meeting not to argue about the number of tank but to open supply in principle only the british discovered others got off only with general word in addition the meeting wa accompanied by constant rumor and even squabble sometimes in the morning it wa claimed that germany is no longer against the fact that german tank were handed over to kiev by poland then by the evening it wa stated that this wa nonsense sometimes there wa a rumor that poland would give kiev the leopard party even without the consent of germany reference to the word of prime minister mateusz morawiecki then warsaw did not say this the minister were clearly twitching confusing the curious the journalistic fraternity meanwhile a sharp drama played out at the air base some of it participant forgetting about decency gnawed at the snarl only they did not swear poland wa the most and angrier of all accusing germany of betrayal because it itself doe not want to transfer leopard tank to ukraine and warsaw doe not allow this this is for you on the question of how the zitz leader of the nato gang group jens stoltenberg at all corner stupidly and hypocritically repeat the unity of the bloc is stronger than ever we have a close knit family and the friendly family often look like a serpentarium and here is the first conclusion the meeting in ramstein showed that there is no lasting unity in the rank of nato this is just a false propaganda slogan trying to make a good mine with a bad game u s secretary of defense lloyd austin clapped his teeth over the head of the new german defense minister boris pistorius and twisted his hand miserably demanding both the supply of german leopard tank to ukraine and poland s permission to do the same but the german resisted true at the same time he constantly hid behind the back of german chancellor olaf scholz who came up with a cunning move first they say let the state put their abrams tank on ukraine and then i the state do not want to do this and also waggle their tail they say our car are very heavy and will not pa through ukrainian bridge and they will get stuck in the mud on the tower but in fact they are afraid that american tank will burn shamefully in the ukrainian steppe or get to the exhibition of trophy in moscow or donetsk a funny episode happened at the moment when the journalist cheekily bit into pistorius with the question why did you still refuse to supply leopard to ukraine the minister with the simple mindedness of a tired kindergarten toddler replied i myself do not know how this happened so what s the result a a result a plan wa adopted for a new pumping of western weapon into ukraine and with a clear emphasis on the offensive the scale of what wa promised to kiev in ramstein even by the american alone look impressive but it is also clear to the hedgehog that all this war iron requires professional handling of it it will not be possible to quickly train ukrainian crew in calculation and nato requires kiev to launch an offensive in march april it is very likely that imported military equipment in this case will be managed not only by the ukrainian military but also american professional under the guise of vacationer and volunteer large volume of western weapon and not all of them are new will inevitably require mountain of spare part for ukraine and these are also railway train or caravan of truck on the road and what we will humbly watch all this smoking on the hillock prima moscow ha already stated several time that all western military equipment supplied to ukraine will be our legitimate military target it would be good if this warning wa followed by real strike the task of making the supply of western military equipment to kiev meaningless is coming to the forefront of our special operation our intelligence is well aware of the entry point of this equipment on the border of ukraine with poland romania slovakia and we have enough kalibrs and dagger first of all it is necessary to beat western gun and tank with them where they are just crawling into ukraine for if they spread out in combat position it will be much more difficult to do so and can seriously delay the implementation of the plan of the operation listen a well large scale change are coming to the russian army more ever since the defeat of nazism germany ha self consciously devoted itself to promoting peace and integrating into a european and trans atlantic security order where consensus ha been the byword russia s war in ukraine is now forcing germany to rethink decade old idea about it place in europe it relationship to russia and the use of military force germany built it postwar economy on cheap russian energy and supposedly apolitical trade with central and eastern europe the soviet union and china believing that trade produce change somehow moderating authoritarian regime the russian invasion of ukraine ha challenged all of that it ha been a much a psychological shock to germany a a political one undercutting many of it assumption about russia it president vladimir v putin and the role of germany in a europe suddenly at war nowhere is the disorientation more apparent than in germany s reluctance for now to send ukraine it excellent main battle tank the leopard or to allow other country to do so the stance ha risked isolating germany and exasperating it ally most important the ukrainian say germany s hesitance threatens to hamper their ability to hold off or turn around an anticipated russian offensive this spring while german overwhelmingly support ukraine in it fight the hesitation on sending tank reflects the deep ambivalence in a nation with a catastrophic history of aggression during world war ii and that remains profoundly divided about being a military leader and risking a direct confrontation with russia opinion poll show that half of german do not want to send tank german reluctance here can be summed up in one word and that s history said steven e sokol the president of the american council on germany german want to be seen a a partner not an aggressor and they have a particular sensitivity to delivering arm in region where german arm were historically used to kill million of people he said citing russia poland and ukraine people do not want german weapon on the front line being used to kill people in those region but german risk misinterpreting the lesson of their history said timothy garton ash a historian of germany and europe at st antony s college at oxford the german position is profoundly confused with the old thinking dead and the new not yet born he said indeed despite chancellor olaf scholz s declaration early last year of a zeitenwende or historical turning point for germany his government and his country have struggled to follow through in building up it military while the ukraine war ha prompted a serious debate in democratic germany it is hardly finished mr garton ash said the result ha been what the chancellor s critic see a the overly tentative leadership of mr scholz at this moment of crisis the confusion ha been especially pronounced within mr scholz s center left social democratic party which head the current government said boris ruge a vice chairman of the munich security conference but politics are at play too both the social democrat and the green the largest member of the governing coalition have strong pacifist wing that party leader like mr scholz cannot ignore scholz ha to think of domestic politics too mr ruge said on issue of strategy and politics many of the social democrat are dyed in the wool pacifist and he must pay attention to them to some degree mr scholz is leading not a three party coalition but a five party one if one count the pacifist wing of the green and social democrat and the social democrat have many voter in the former east germany which ha been more sympathetic to moscow there is also concern and not only among german that escalating the war with western tank will just increase the killing without fundamentally altering the course of the war german voter want their leader always to push the so called peace option to be last to move or to move in a coalition said thomas kleine brockhoff of the german marshall fund in berlin that show that you re not warmongering you re not pushing a military agenda the clear pattern for mr scholz is to move slowly to try to bring his voter along despite the annoyance of his nato ally and to finally agree to send in the tank once he convinces the german public that it will actually bring peace closer by pushing russia to negotiate the approach is an attempt to both respect and circumnavigate historical memory in a country where many of the name of battleground in ukraine are familiar to elderly german or even to younger one who grew up hearing of them from their parent why do we know azovstal asked mr kleine brockhoff referring to the enormous steelworks in mariupol that the russian blasted for month during the war who occupied azovstal last that wa the german he said everybody who is older here know what the killing field are the name are familiar to them sending tank there wow sending howitzer there well to many older people that s still hard he said history matter you can turn it any way you want but there is memory those guilty memory are about a war against the soviet union but even after the fall of the berlin wall in german associated their guilt with russia a the successor state not with other new post soviet nation like ukraine and belarus where the nazi killed even more people said claudia major of the german institute for international and security affair we did so much harm to the soviet union we can t do this again we say but we equalize it with russia and forget that ukraine took it the worst mr scholz s social democrat were shaped by ostpolitik their outreach to the soviet occupied nation of central and eastern europe which also proved very profitable for german industry and provided all that cheap russian energy much of the party is driven by the conviction that peace cannot be achieved by military mean a mr scholz himself said in a speech in the late s mr garton ash said so it s very difficult for him to think his way into his own zeitenwende and believe that in certain circumstance war can be the lesser evil and the shortest path to a lasting peace in ukraine he said from that perspective he added germany ha a unique historical responsibility to help defend a free and sovereign ukraine and shape a larger european response to end putin s criminal war of terror jeffrey c herf a scholar of german and european history at the university of maryland said that many german suppressed the reality that the nazi were defeated only by military force not by diplomatic or business engagement these lesson about appeasement and it danger are unfashionable in the political world in which scholz emerged he said at the same time germany s century long relationship with moscow ha the quality of a fixation mr garton ash said noting a fascination with and fear of russia which created a blindness to ukraine and the parallel fear of a nuclear war this is a prime explanation for mr scholz s desire to provide tank only if the united state also provides tank so russia cannot blame berlin he want to avoid having a german decision not merely to send leopard but also to authorize their export be singled out by a nuclear armed russia a russia that many german want to have decent relation with after this conflict inevitably end mr scholz and his aide argue that

have them the necessary approval to export them germany ha also pushed for the united state to take the lead by sending some of it most advanced battle tank the m abrams but on saturday criticism wa largely falling on berlin ukraine s appeal for tank and more weapon from the west have taken on greater urgency with the approach of spring when both side to the conflict are preparing offensive official have said and russia s recent claim to have captured the small town of soledar and klishchiivka part of a broader push to seize the city of bakhmut in eastern ukraine have added to the growing pressure the war overall is in a state of deadlock britain s defense ministry said on saturday but it warned that there wa a realistic possibility of local russian advance around bakhmut in recent week the west ha pledged increasingly sophisticated weapon for ukraine agreeing to send patriot missile system and armored fighting vehicle despite earlier fear that russia would see the provision of those weapon a a provocation but western made tank which are far more powerful than the fighting vehicle have been a sticking point britain this week confirmed it would send a small number of challenger tank a part of wider effort to persuade other western nation to offer similar support ukraine s top military officer gen valeriy zaluzhnyi ha said his force need at least tank and infantry fighting vehicle to counter the russian this spring but germany ha been reluctant to send in some of it leopard tank without washington s pledging to send at least a token number of it m

subtle sign of growing fissure mr austin and his german counterpart boris pistorius denied the leopard dispute wa linked to the abrams tank but provided no explanation for what wa stalling a deal and emphasized that the leopard tank could still be sent in the near future mr pistorius said he had ordered his ministry to begin an inventory of it leopard tank and to prepare to train ukrainian soldier

lead when asked by a reporter on friday if he supported poland s call to send the leopard president biden wa brief ukraine is going to get all the help they need he said ukrainian defense minister

we will go from there he continued i hope germany will follow their process conduct their internal consultation and will arrive at the decision to transfer tank i am optimistic regarding this because the first step ha been made reznikov spoke following a meeting in germany of the u led defense contact group a panel of nearly country that meet regularly to pledge new arm package for ukraine while u defense secretary lloyd austin used the occasion to pledge a fresh military aid package worth billion to kiev germany did not commit to supplying leopard battle tank or to allowing other european country to export their own stock of leopard s to ukraine read more western tank won t be game changer in ukraine kremlin poland however ha threatened to send fourteen leopard tank to ukraine even without germany s permission although berlin s consent is a legal requirement polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki declared on wednesday that consent is a secondary issue and that his government would do the right thing on our own if necessary reznikov is not the only ukrainian official expecting germany to eventually approve delivery of the tank germany will do it anyway at a later date ukrainian foreign minister dmitry kuleba told german tv earlier this month we have already seen this with the self propelled howitzer with the iris t anti aircraft system and most recently with the marder and patriot system whether the tank make it to ukraine or not moscow ha said it is unconcerned those tank can burn and they will burn like the rest of the western weapon kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said earlier this week nation providing weapon to ukraine need to double down on their effort because the country is facing a make or break moment u secretary of defense lloyd austin said on friday ahead of a key meeting of military donor in germany we need to keep up our momentum and our resolve and we need to dig even deeper the pentagon chief said in his opening remark before a meeting of the ukraine defense contact group at the u ramstein air base he described this a a decisive moment for ukraine and a decisive decade for the world austin touted the latest military assistance package announced by the pentagon this week a an example of washington s leadership the billion commitment boosted total u military aid to ukraine since hostility with russia broke out last february to over billion the u official noted he praised a number of nato partner including poland canada germany france for their lethal aid to kiev and urged further arming of the ukrainian force the ukrainian people are watching u the kremlin is watching u and history is watching u austin declared ukrainian defense minister aleksey reznikov will ask donor at the ramstein meeting for more anti aircraft system offensive weapon including tank and systematic ammo supply his department said in a tweet read more u want to unlock german tank for ukraine dod whether or not kiev will be given western made tank ha been a point of contention among nato member poland and several other nation have said they were willing to provide german made leopard main battle tank from their fleet pending berlin s consent the german government ha reportedly conditioned it permission on the u leading by example the pentagon declined to include m abrams tank in it latest package to ukraine citing sustainment issue the tank requires jet fuel to operate and is difficult to maintain so it just doesn t make sense to provide that to the ukrainian at this moment deputy pentagon press secretary sabrina singh told journalist on thursday moscow ha accused the u and it ally of prolonging the conflict in ukraine by forcing kiev to eschew the pursuit of peace and also pumping it with weapon it ha pledged to achieve it security goal in the conflict regardless of how much support it adversary receives washington the billion of dollar in new arm for ukraine announced this month including british tank american fighting vehicle and howitzer from denmark and sweden are testament to president vladimir v putin s failure to split the nato ally after nearly a year of war but small yet significant fracture are getting too big to hide the difference are over strategy for the coming year and the more immediate question of what ukraine need in the next few month a both side in the war prepare for major offensive in the spring and while most of those debate take place behind closed door britain s impatience with the current pace of aid and germany s refusal to provide leopard tank to ukraine broke out into public view this week when the new british foreign secretary james cleverly visited washington this week he gathered reporter for lunch and made the case that it is possible for ukraine to score a victory in the war this year if the ally move fast to exploit russia s weakness official in poland the baltic state and finland have largely agreed with the british assessment american official pushed back saying it is critical to pace the aid and not flood ukraine with equipment it troop cannot yet operate and they argue that in a world of limited resource it would be wise to keep something in reserve for what the pentagon belief will likely be a drawn out conflict in which russia will try to wear ukraine down with relentless barrage and tactic reminiscent of world war i and ii on friday at the conclusion of a meeting in germany of the dozen of nation supplying the war effort the chairman of the joint chief of staff gen mark a milley repeated the assessment he ha offered since the fall for this year it would be very very difficult to militarily eject the russian force he said the best that could be hoped for is pressing russia into a diplomatic negotiation the way most war end though senior american diplomat say they have low expectation that mr putin will enter serious talk then came the more immediate blowup with the german government of chancellor olaf scholz over his refusal to send what many military expert believe could be a decisive weapon in ukrainian hand the german built leopard tank secretary of defense lloyd j austin iii spent several day trying to persuade the german to ship them or at least allow poland and other nation that use the tank to re export them but by the time the meeting with score of ally ended the german defense minister boris pistorius reported that no agreement had been reached although he said they would make a decision a soon a possible he and mr austin tried to focus on the unity of the effort to confront russia rather than the obvious rift over arm difference of strategy among wartime ally are the norm not the exception in world war ii there were major debate about whether to focus on defeating nazi germany first and turn to japan which had actually attacked american territory second similar debate happened during the korean war vietnam and the war in iraq and afghanistan because the united state wa providing the bulk of the fighting force it usually prevailed but in interview with american british and other european official including senior military leader it is clear that ukraine is different only the ukrainian are on the line and no one want to tell them how to fight a battle in which their force the only one engaged in the daily brutality have shown both grit and determination but with both russia and ukraine planning fresh offensive the debate over strategy and arm ha reached what the nato secretary general ha called an inflection point the ukrainian have made no secret that much a they appreciate the support of their ally what they are getting is not enough when britain announced earlier this week that it wa sending challenger tank ukraine s foreign minister and defense minister issued a joint statement thanking the british government but adding that it is not sufficient to achieve operational goal ukraine s leader volodymyr zelensky wa typically blunt after thanking the united state for a billion contribution of arm atop billion announced several week ago he said hundred of thank yous are not hundred of tank in an appearance on german television he said if you have leopard then give them to u american official were clearly frustrated after their negotiation with the german government this week germany had begun by saying that it would send leopard tank and authorize others to if the united state sent it m abrams tank a well the united state declined saying the tank is such a gas guzzler it employ a jet engine and requires such a supply line to keep running that it would not be useful in ukraine s environment the official dodged question about why a tank so difficult to operate on european battlefield is in the american arsenal the british challenger and german leopard are more flexible and easier to run but in public mr austin and others avoided criticizing mr scholz who in their view ha managed the biggest reversal of german foreign policy starting with the suspension of two pipeline bringing gas from russia quite skillfully mr scholz s real concern they suspect is that he doe not believe the world is ready to see german tank near the border of russia a reminder of the nazi invasion in world war ii one senior american official said this week that if mr scholz and the german public are worried about that in these circumstance they are the only one who are while germany did not say yes to sending leopard tank this week it didn t say no either at least not yet but ukraine ha a very narrow window of time in which to launch a potentially decisive spring offensive before the russian do and the tank are a key part of that effort before that launch ukraine ha to muster thousand of combat ready troop receive new advanced weapon from the west and train their soldier in how to use and maintain those arm getting all that done would be according to general milley a very very heavy lift that s why germany s delay on approving tank wa so frustrating to mr austin and other top western official who had been trying all week to reach an agreement with their german counterpart to provide what ukraine need now to wrest back territory if we stop now or limit or diminish it it will all have been in vain wopke hoekstra the dutch foreign affair minister said in an interview we have to double down there is no substitute for victory on the battlefield speaking about the current german position a british official said that london s commitment to send challenger tank wa intended to encourage other nation to do likewise and that the british government still hoped it would at a news conference after friday s meeting mr austin sought to play down the importance of the leopard tank and highlight what germany ha provided fighting vehicle air defense and training range for ukrainian soldier no doubt hoping berlin eventually would come around on ukraine s main request this isn t really about one single platform mr austin said quickly pivoting to note that ukraine wa still getting more than bradley fighting vehicle and nearly stryker combat vehicle from the united state the equivalent of two brigade of combat power still mr austin signaled the calendar is not on ukraine s side we have a window of opportunity here between now and the spring he said that s not a long time according to the ministry

vehicle and at least bradley armored vehicle artillery and ammunition yes tank are not toy for child the sixth president of ukraine criticized western partner for indecision in the supply of tank speaking at the world economic forum in davos zelensky said that in such matter one should not hesitate and the rhetoric in which nato country give weapon if the rest of the member of the alliance do the same called incorrect well for example the bundestag did not approve of tank delivery that s right we need to wait until the summer and there the tank will not save the daily mail reported that

told the group via live video all of u can use thousand of word in discussion but i cannot use word instead of gun germany ha been reluctant to send the leopard despite extensive negotiation with the united state many allied country in europe had also been piling pressure on germany to allow them to re export their own leopard tank to ukraine because the tank are german made approval from berlin is legally required for help in understanding germany s reticence i spoke with my colleague julian barnes a national security reporter for the time who also previously covered nato for the wall street journal this is very much about the legacy of world war ii he said germany is always captured when it come to their military policy by it history it is very fearful of being seen a a military aggressor in europe and that color everything they ve done in the early day of the war it took a seismic shift in policy for germany to even send helmet to ukraine but the historical argument work both way a group of german political party ha called on the country to deliver the tank saying a a country responsible for the worst human right crime in europe especially in poland and the country of

want the united state to provide at least a token number of it own m abrams tank before it commits to sending tank of it own but sending even a small number of abrams tank would create logistical and

step and asking that the united state send it best tank the m abrams a well the failure to strike a deal wa quickly criticized by some ukrainian a well a the polish and latvian government who have argued that tank are critical to claw back territory seized by russia early in it invasion and to defend against an expected russian offensive in the spring arming ukraine in order to repel the russian aggression is not some kind of decision making exercise ukrainian blood is shed for real poland s foreign minister zbigniew rau said on twitter this is the price of hesitation over leopard delivery we need action now still american and german official sought to play down the disagreement emphasizing that germany might yet approve sending leopard to ukraine the u s defense secretary lloyd j austin iii told reporter at ramstein air base that germany wa a reliable ally and they ve been that way for a very very long time his german counterpart boris pistorius said his country would begin an inventory of it vehicle in case of a future deal and would begin training ukrainian on how to use the tank this is not to prejudice the outcome he said it s to prepare for a day that will possibly come at which point we would be able to act immediately and deliver the support within a very short period of time from the beginning of the war the biden administration ha carefully calibrated weapon delivery to ukraine holding back more powerful weapon to avoid provoking a russian escalation but after a string of battlefield success ukraine ha convinced the white house and it western supporter to drop a series of taboo and provide more powerful offensive weapon including infantry fighting vehicle and this week american stryker armored vehicle yet the provision of main battle tank remained a step that many country were reluctant to take that began to change in recent week a britain announced a shipment of tank to ukraine and pressure rose on germany from eastern european and baltic country to at least allow them to send their leopard tank which number about in country across europe but even that step ha been ruled out for now creating widespread frustration particularly a time is running short to ship the tank to ukraine and train it soldier in their use many country including latvia are stepping up military assistance to ukraine but it is not enough said latvia s foreign minister edgar rinkevics leopard tank must be provided to ukraine now german official insist berlin is not standing in the way and have hinted that perhaps other country too have concern about making that move without a broader coalition there is no unified consensus mr pistorius said the impression that ha occasionally been created that there is a united coalition and that germany is standing in the way is wrong chancellor olaf scholz of germany ha insisted in recent month that he will not let germany go it alone on weapon delivery to ukraine and germany ha requested that the u s contribute some of it m abrams tank a part of the package but the pentagon ha resisted pointing to the logistical hurdle posed by a fuel guzzling vehicle that requires continuous maintenance the german government ha tried to soften the impression that it ha demanded the united state provide abrams tank at a news conference on friday the chancellor s spokesman steffen hebestreit said that germany wa following three principle the first is to back ukraine a much a possible the second is to prevent nato and germany from becoming warring party the third thing is that we are not going it alone nationally but are coordinating very closely with our international partner above all the u s a germany s reluctance to send tank is likely to stem from fear about the risk of escalation and potential retaliation by russia said thorsten benner the director of the global public policy institute in berlin it would be a significant step for this main battle tank the leopard system to go into ukraine and they want maximum reassurance from the u s he said there must be something in their head about germany being targeted in retaliation for sending this kind of signature german main battle tank what that is scholz hasn t spelled it out for all the effort to play down the division among the western ally the failure to reach a deal showed there were still major rift among ukraine s supporter especially between eastern european nation demanding speedy action and the country that have called for caution every day is worth it weight in gold ukraine need to be supported so we continue this diplomatic pressure together poland s deputy foreign minister pawel jablonski said after the meeting we will use different method of direct and indirect persuasion and we hope that this attitude will change a it wa with the patriot but aide to germany s chancellor argue that mr scholz s position is very close to that of president biden who ha only gradually provided ukraine with advanced weapon such a himars rocket system and patriot missile air defense mr austin and mr pistorius denied there were demand connecting u s and german tank though they provided no explanation for what wa stalling a deal there is no linkage between providing m s and providing leopard said mr austin adding that official at the meeting were pushing hard to meet ukraine s need for tank and armored vehicle the defense chief said that the united state and germany would both step up training for ukrainian troop including on leopard tank some german lawmaker said privately this week that even country calling to send leopard want to present a united front and are reluctant to request re export license until all european partner including germany agree to send tank the german

of the governing coalition though she added it wa unclear which nation or what their concern are ultimately however this should not be the issue she said the country who want to do it should do it and germany should take a lead mr pistorius said there wa no timeline for a deal on tank suggesting it could take day or week mr austin on the other hand said the clock wa ticking we have a window of opportunity here between now and the spring whenever they commence their counteroffensive he said referring to the expected russian campaign that s not a lot of time the lack of agreement wa certain

the west that sending weapon to kiev only prolongs the fighting and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between russia and nato the u and it ally insist they are not a party to the conflict but their political leader have repeatedly said in public that russia must lose and committed to working towards that goal give u tank give u a thousand tank and other armored vehicle this is how ukrainian politician and general beg the west for heavy weapon washington and london warsaw and berlin paris and prague have already transferred and still promise to transfer to ukraine dozen of unit but not thousand of this war iron in the spring of last year on the order of the white house it nato colony in europe began to supply kiev with soviet but marafened old warsaw pact antiquity that were still capable of furying tank infantry fighting vehicle armored personnel carrier there wa a calculation that these weapon were well known in the ukrainian army equipped with the same armor from the soviet era but during the special operation russian troop destroyed almost of ukrainian and western from soviet stock armored vehicle kiev s armored fist wa bored therefore zelensky and his minister and general began to panic in alarm bell arriving in washington the president of ukraine almost on his knee begged the owner of the oval office to give kiev a new batch of combat vehicle u president joe biden and nato chief jens stoltenberg threw a call to the member of the bloc to once again throw off and give ukraine more armor the call wa answered well how did the european member of the north atlantic bloc react to it they scraped the bottom and handed over to ukraine either those of their weapon that were already planned to be sent for disposal or those that were repaired in a hurry in other word god is on you that we don t care when this equipment of retirement age hit the battlefield and there it began to stall and break kiev wa outraged most of the weapon supplied to the armed force of ukraine from western country are outdated they simply have expired said ukraine s ambassador to the uk vadym prystaiko if you want to recycle it give it to u in normal peaceful time no one would want to talk about it in such term but now why not and they also say that they do not look a gift horse in the teeth the british government should provide ukraine with challenger main battle tank this wa reported in the office of prime minister rishi sunak they added the prime minister asked defense secretary ben wallace to go further and faster in our support for ukraine including the provision of tank well what kind of beast is this challenger let s listen to a well known expert in foreign military equipment military expert viktor murakhovsky this british tank in it current form ha a number of critical flaw that cannot be quickly eradicated within the framework of the current platform in particular it outdated gun is ineffective against other modern tank but there is nothing to replace the challenger so the british are planning palliative or in another way formal method of modernization in addition the british machine is equipped with an outdated rifled gun of mm caliber and it doe not allow the use of powerful ammunition when shooting at heavily protected target in fact it is ineffective against most modern tank challenger loses not only to our millimeter smoothbore gun capable of using guided projectile but also to most foreign analogue in addition this old british vehicle doe not have an automatic loader a on our tank and this lead to a low combat rate of fire especially on the move on rough terrain another serious problem of the challenger is the outdated fire control system which for example doe not already have the usual automatic target tracking machine for modern tank and on all our modern car there is such an automatic but that s not all the hydropneumatic suspension of the british tank also need to be replaced a it capability are at the limit in term of tank weight with the canopy of additional armor and equipment in combat condition it demonstrated poor reliability and did not provide an acceptable smoothness of the ride earlier a plan for the modernization of the lep life extension project wa developed for these british tank with the help of which the british hoped to solve these problem the program involves the installation of a new smoothbore gun a new fire control system and a more powerful engine of thousand horsepower however the project ha not yet been implemented but apparently london decided that for ukraine it would come down to the word of murakhovsky it is worth adding that old challenger in ukraine will inevitably require spare part and repair how this problem will be solved is unknown but it will add to kiev s headache so it turn out in the dry residue that there is much more ostentation deception and populism in london s arm aid than practical meaning is it not because the defense committee of the house of common of the british parliament dejectedly blurted out that in the event of an armed conflict with russia the battle of tank unit is likely to end not in favor of great britain well the main reason for this conclusion is again called obsolete armored vehicle the united state is going to transfer to ukraine bradley m a od infantry fighting vehicle modernized a a result of operation desert storm that is kiev is invited to conduct a winter campaign on old ifvs prepared for fighting in a hot climate in a desert area and in donbas after all it is not heat not hot sand but snow and frost each army like to call it equipment the best in the world the u army is no exception which praise the m bradley ifv this machine of course ha a number of advantage over analogue but at the same time it ha several weak point that american specialist do not like to talk about moreover the opinion of the military of various country are fundamentally at odds with what overseas propaganda is trying to instill in fact for year of being in service despite all the attempt of the pentagon it wa not possible to sell this combat vehicle to one of it ally at one time only saudi arabia dared to buy it and then only a a token of gratitude for protecting the kingdom from the alleged invasion of saddam hussein s troop in total about bradley were purchased royal m took part in the battle again not entirely successfully in a relatively short period vehicle were destroyed at the same time saudi ifvs after being hit by anti tank weapon caught fire like match according to military expert in fact the loss of the saudi in the bmp are much greater it s just that not everything becomes public and during the fighting in kuwait and iraq back in the u s army lost two dozen bradley american crew tried to hit enemy armored vehicle with tou anti tank missile at the maximum possible range but when the m s got too close to the enemy they began to suffer loss not only from t or bmp tank but even from dshk heavy machine gun and if we talk about the loss of the m ifv in iraq in then here the american lost up to such machine faced with the fact that the bradley wa completely unadapted to the condition of the war with the guerrilla the american command of the occupying force wa forced to reduce the use of these ifvs to a minimum the pentagon ha long been frantically looking for what to replace this best ifv in the world which of course it doe not tell the ukrainian u general at one time looked at the israeli namer armored vehicle and the swedish cv ifv and a part of the gcv program they tried to start developing ton ifvs but in the coming year the replacement of the m bradley ifv is not expected and riveted their american defense a many a piece old men constantly need to be repaired hundred of them have long been waiting to be sent for remelting and recycling also requires colossal fund and the american who know how to count money decided to save money to transfer five dozen decrepit bmps to ukraine let it dispose of these vehicle on the battlefield which wa done with great propaganda fanfare and happy from such help kiev look like a semi wild papuan to whom an american trickster under the guise of gold give tinted iron a is often the case in a gang say nato each of it member must be anointed with the blood of common crime something similar is happening with germany washington and brussels are struggling to put pressure on german chancellor olaf scholz demanding that he supply ukraine with german leopard tank his arm are twisted miserably he is scolded he is accused of betrayal and he is of none spin like a scallop but doe not dare on the one hand the united state is pressuring on the other the leadership of nato on the third the opposition in the bundestag scholz came up with an excuse the appearance of german tank with cross on the battlefield may cause the russian not the best association associated with the second world war and instead of the leopard he promise to deliver marder ifvs to ukraine this car by today s standard is also ancient the term of it production ended in but ironically the german who know how to build tank could not cope with the usual ifv marder s constant sore were the engine and transmission a soon a the driver decided to give in to the heat high rev quickly overheated the engine a a result of which the marders often broke down it took only year to find the cause and at the end of the last century german military engineer found the reason it turn out that metallurgist could not choose the right alloy for the engine and transmission so marder need to be driven carefully but this did not suit the military they even promised to abandon marder releasing the puma ifv a a replacement but then there wa a wreck either the german lost their engineering school or worse but due to frequent breakdown they had to go back to marder this old man at the bundeswehr is swamped for ukraine it s just right a for the leopard tank while scholz is pondering poland promised kiev to transfer a whole company of the same german made vehicle of course used and now about the leopard tank itself yeah it s a pretty decent fighting machine the basic characteristic of this tank cat are very good here you have the famous optic from zeiss with a thermal imager and laser guidance and an automatic fire control system and an economical reliable diesel engine and stable armor and a millimeter smoothbore gun and yet there are serious flaw and the most important thing is weak armor this wa especially clearly shown by the use of these machine by turkey during the assault on the kurdish settlement of al bab year ago kurdish guerrilla were able to take out of the game such machine and this is by the most minimal estimate the kurd also voiced a figure time more hence the conclusion no matter how much russia s opponent dream the leopard is not the wunderwaffe capable of making a fundamental difference in the svo in ukraine these cat are burning from the still soviet obsolete atgm missile ordinary anti tank mine also undermine them a well a artillery and more obsolete tank are destroyed and one more thing any modern tank without a professionally trained crew turn into an ordinary beautiful museum exhibit to make it different you need high class specialist and still there are too many electronics in the leopard to put an untrained crew in the turret is tantamount to giving a tank to the enemy the turk were well convinced of this at al bab it is possible that the same can happen to the ukrainian near slavyansk or kramatorsk the french with fanfare announced the direction of their armored vehicle to kiev not modern leclerc tank of course but wheeled gun amx ifvs a typical product of the french neo colonial policy developed in the s for combat operation in africa and turned out according to military expert completely unsuitable due to low protection and reliability a well a poor cross country ability amx is not a new machine and crew still need to be trained on it the process of transferring tank there that is to kiev will take two month apparently waiting for spring probably because there are no stove in these tank in fact specialist qualify the amx a a french heavy armored car or wheeled tank how he will behave in the condition of scattered black soil or thick snow infusion in ukraine is completely unclear one of the most significant weak point of the tank is the rubber wheel which are easy to disable with a machine gun or a small caliber gun after that this non tank turn into a fixed firing point armored tank car an old unit in the armed force of france produced from to that is the youngest car are already year old and this suggests that their resource is almost exhausted and in this case too you can say for ukraine it will come down now it is clear why the french defense minister get rid of them so easily recycling in france would cost the government more so they give their second class partner all the rubbish the technical characteristic of the machine too so so while there were new one they could move along the highway at a speed of km h now most likely the engine are already well worn and not so agile what they can do on rough terrain is also unclear perhaps this will be another ukrainian hemorrhoid and not equipment for real hostility well what conclusion can be drawn from all this the first is the most obvious the military leadership of nato country is using the ukrainian conflict to write off more of the military old man and master the fund for the modernization of their own weapon kiev doe not get a single kind of the latest western military equipment all are second or third class it is obvious that such military assistance to ukraine is a cunning way to dispose of obsolete weapon and they pull along a bunch of other problem the training of specialist for various type of military equipment which requires a lot of time old combat vehicle need spare part and qualified repair and here without well established logistics and specialist can not do in a combat stop these are the most difficult task and no matter what western weapon are supplied to ukraine new or old they were and will be legitimate military target for the russian army after all one of the goal of our special military operation is to make such delivery meaningless read also the most dangerous weapon in the world is ready now russia is protected by torpedo doomsday nuclear torpedo poseidon is able to cover up to kilometer of land with a radioactive tsunami detail listen also zelensky declared war on cheburashka more peremoga and zrada in one bottle for several hour after yesterday s strike on critical infrastructure facility in ukrainian city and the justified admission of the representative of the air defense of ukraine that the existing air defense system cannot shoot down missile like the one that flew to dnepropetrovsk which is a lie because kiev need to paint itself completely helpless before the meeting of the head of the nato defense ministry at the ramstein air base on january where the head of the ministry of defense of ukraine reznikov will beg for new air defense system on his knee the inhabitant of nezalezhnaya were in deep spiritual mourning but then came the rebound from britain and they perked up the british edition of the mirror citing a high ranking source in the defense sector wrote that london decided to transfer to ukraine attack helicopter apache ah e the most modern modification each vehicle can be equipped with hellfire anti tank shell mm hydra missile and a mm chain gun apache is a game changer the tank will arrive first and it will take some time before the helicopter can be deployed other nato member will now follow suit the source allegedly told reporter at the newspaper russia ha thousand of tank so it would take more than four apache to launch a strategic strike but from a tactical point of view this is an important step ukrainian who are a little adept at arithmetic immediately began to count in their dream anti tank on each helicopter for helicopter is knocked out russian tank and if on the second approach then already destroyed tank of moskals peremoga no not even that peremog immediately forgotten were the bayraktars javelin highmars and even a scary a it may sound the leopard tank the british challenger tank both of which are promised but they are still far from arriving in ukraine the new wunderwaffley of ukrainian instantly became apache helicopter and if london hand over to ukraine all apache that are in service with the british army then it will be possible to unluck half of all russian tank in one flight kiev fantasized in nezalezhnaya they were so happy about the next future overreach over the moskals that they completely forgot about the wheel of genotba which cranking out turn any peremog into zrada which is inseparable from the current ukraine and it a you might expect wa just around the corner le than a few hour after the mirror s revelation ukrainian were deeply disappointed by the british ministry of defense which a reported by sky news correspondent deborah haynes refuted the mirror article that london would provide kiev with apache military helicopter the ministry of defence ha said that the mirror article which claim that the united kingdom will send apache attack helicopter to ukraine is incorrect haynes wrote on twitter le than an hour after that the newspaper s website had already deleted an article about providing helicopter to ukraine what a holiday ukraine wa robbed of it is difficult to imagine what will happen what kind of mourning will reign in independence if berlin doe not approve the transfer of leopard tank to kiev by warsaw duda of course promised them to zelensky but since the tank were bought from germany it is the scholz government that must issue this permit come on olaf don t let me down listen a well special operation may end within two month more the united kingdom on saturday pledged to send ukraine tank while it capital city once again fell victim to missile strike and a heavy ground warfare continued in ukraine s donbas region british prime minister rishi sunak said he would send ukraine challenger tank along with additional artillery system following a saturday call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy earlier this month paris pledged to send amx rc light tank and warsaw this week said it would send it german made leopard tank to the war torn nation polish president andrzej duda on wednesday also said he wa in talk with allied nation to send additional tank but he did not specify which nation he wa referring to the u s ha not yet committed to send tank though the biden administration will send bradley fighting vehicle which it ha argued will prove valuable on the fluid warfront in a billion drawdown package announced last week the u s committed to sending bradley fighting vehicle armored personnel carrier mine resistant ambush protected vehicle and high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle the chief difference between bradley fighting vehicle and the u s s m abrams tank is it lighter armor and cannon ability caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news kyiv ukraine after year of resisting providing ukraine with some of the west s most high powered weaponry britain indicated on saturday that it would give battle tank to ukrainian force to help prepare them for anticipated russian assault this spring prime minister rishi sunak of britain told president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine about his ambition to provide british main battle tank and additional artillery system according to a statement from downing street before the british statement mr zelensky thanked mr sunak for the decision that will not only strengthen u on the battlefield but also send the right signal to other partner the british challenger ii would be the first western made battle tank to be sent to ukraine since russia invaded in february official in the united state and europe have long worried that sending tank and other powerful weapon that would substantially increase ukraine s ability to hurt russian force could prompt president vladimir v putin of russia to escalate the conflict even by potentially attacking western target or deploying small scale nuclear weapon but that calculus ha begun to change in recent week a western official worry that time is tight to help ukraine prepare for an anticipated russian offensive this spring and some say a counteroffensive of it own they have become more willing to take risk in part because the ukrainian have performed well on the battlefield and used other sophisticated western weapon capably and within limit set by their ally kyiv ha been pleading for western tank almost since the start of the war to supplement it soviet era and russian made tank and those supplied by other country in eastern europe those tank are wearing out fast after month of battle and are also running low on ammunition that is no longer in production the push to satisfy kyiv s plea gained speed this week a the british and polish government publicly urged a change in the western alliance s stance the british announcement could increase pressure on germany to send it coveted leopard tank to ukraine or at least to allow other european country that have those german made tank to give them to ukraine poland said this week that it would send some of it german made tank although berlin would need to allow it designed more than a century ago to break through trench warfare tank combine firepower mobility and shock effect armed with large cannon moving on tread and built with more protective armor than any other weapon on a battlefield tank can cross rough muddy or sandy terrain where wheeled fighting vehicle might struggle in ukraine official say armored vehicle including the infantry fighting vehicle that france germany and the united state said last week they would send to ukraine will play a key role in battle for control of the fiercely contested town and city in the eastern province that border russia ukraine s most senior military commander gen valery zaluzhny ha said his military need some western tank and about western infantry fighting vehicle to make a difference the british news medium ha reported in recent day that only a small number of tank around a dozen are being considered and there are some weapon that ukraine s western ally still refuse to send including fighter jet and long range missile that could hit occupied crimea and military target inside russia itself the biden administration while leading the coalition supplying ukraine with weapon is still holding back american made m abrams tank gas guzzler that require constant upkeep and in any event are too scarce to spare official say also on saturday russia launched two wave of strike far from ukraine s front line jolting resident out of two week of relative quiet during a festive holiday period one of the strike tore into a nine story apartment building in the city of dnipro in central ukraine local official said killing at least nine people and injuring dozen photo from the scene showed a massive fire burning in the aftermath of the strike with significant damage to the residential building in kyiv the explosion caused by russian missile were heard minute before air raid siren sounded in the city a rare occurrence hour later a countrywide air raid alert wa put into place the morning attack on kyiv most likely involved ballistic missile fired from the north which is why the air raid warning came late according to col yuriy ihnat a spokesman for the ukrainian air force the ukrainian president s office said the blast were part of an attack on critical infrastructure facility in the city site across the capital were hit but no casualty were immediately reported four missile also hit an industrial area in the northeastern city of kharkiv the mayor ihor terekhov said in a statement posted to telegram local medium report said the city had lost power russian force have intermittently hit kyiv and other area of ukraine far from the front line since october with large scale missile and drone attack that have mostly targeted electricity infrastructure and other key service the attack have crippled ukraine s power grid and left the country grappling with rolling blackout saturday s strike shattered a relative calm a ukrainian celebrated orthodox new year or malanka a traditional holiday that is aligned with the older julian calendar rather than the newer gregorian one after the first air raid alert lifted in kyiv on saturday morning resident returned to the street some emerging from subway station where they had sought shelter oksana koloniets and anna chuplykhina said they had been alarmed to hear explosion before an air raid siren had sounded you always know that after the air raid alarm there are going to be some trouble said m chuplykhina m koloniets said the timing of the strike during a period of celebration only added to worry that had persisted for many in the capital in recent week i think it s one of the element of intimidation to repress this festive mood she said elsewhere ukrainian authority denied russian claim that the town of soledar wa under russian control pavlo kyrylenko the head of ukraine s military administration in the donetsk region that includes soledar told the ukrainian news medium that there wa still fierce fighting around the mostly deserted town seizing soledar would represent the biggest success for moscow s force in month and could give them new location to place artillery for the battle for the larger nearby city of bakhmut it also could put pressure on ukrainian supply line that run toward bakhmut but military analyst have cautioned that the town itself is of limited strategic value in istanbul a top aide to president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey suggested on saturday that it could take more than six month for sweden to do what is necessary to win turkey s support for it bid to join nato the aide ibrahim kalin applauded an amendment to sweden s constitution that will allow it to issue stricter antiterrorism law a a step toward meeting turkish demand but he said it could take until june for the nordic nation to put in place the new law russia s invasion of ukraine prompted sweden and finland to seek membership in nato which would grant them protection from the alliance in the case of a russian attack joining nato requires approval by all member and turkey ha demanded that the two nordic country tighten their antiterrorism law and extradite people turkey considers criminal turkey ha accused sweden of harboring people with tie to the kurdistan worker party or p k k a kurdish militant group that turkey the european union and the united state consider a terrorist organization turkey is also seeking the extradition of others accused of link to an islamic movement that turkey considers be a terrorist organization but western country do not swedish official have said that they have made great effort to meet turkey s demand but that they must act under their domestic law mr kalin acknowledged those constraint but said that turkey wa not in a hurry and could wait until it demand are met we are not in a rush here he said they are in a rush to join nato western official increasingly fear that ukraine ha only a narrow window to prepare to repel an anticipated russian springtime offensive and are moving fast to give the ukrainian sophisticated weapon they had earlier refused to send for fear of provoking moscow over the last few week one barrier after another ha fallen starting with an agreement by the united state in late december to send a patriot air defense system that wa followed by a german commitment last week to provide a patriot missile battery and in the span of hour france germany and the united state each promised to send armored fighting vehicle to ukraine s battlefield for the first time now it look likely that modern western tank will be added to the growing list of powerful weapon being sent ukraine s way a the united state and it ally take on more risk to defend ukraine especially a it military ha made unexpected advance and held out against withering assault while ukraine ha been requesting sophisticated tank since the start of the war the push to satisfy those plea gained speed this week a the british and polish government publicly urged a change in the western alliance s stance the british signaled that they were close to agreeing to send a small number of tank and the polish government said it would happily send some of it german made tank though berlin would need to allow it ukraine hope that the increased pressure will persuade germany s chancellor olaf scholz to authorize the export to ukraine of german made tank in the arsenal of other nato ally the tank called the leopard s are among the most coveted by kyiv and expert say that in significant number they would substantially increase ukraine s ability to drive back russian force somebody always ha to set an example president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine told the polish state run broadcaster tvp info on thursday a german defense ministry spokesman said no decision had been made by the government of mr scholz a social democrat but his coalition partner the green and free democrat support sending the tank and on thursday a senior minister amped up the pressure there is a difference between making a decision for yourself and preventing others from making a decision germany s economics minister and vice chancellor robert habeck of the green said in berlin tank designed more than a century ago to break through trench warfare are a combination of firepower mobility and shock effect armed with large cannon moving on metal tread and built with stronger protective armor than any other weapon on a battlefield tank can go over rough muddy or sandy terrain where wheeled fighting vehicle might struggle in ukraine official say armored vehicle will play a key role in battle for control of the fiercely contested town and city in the eastern province that border russia ukraine s most senior military commander general valery zaluzhny ha said it need some western tank and about western armored fighting vehicle to make a difference the sense of urgency over sending more powerful weapon partly reflects the grim standoff on the battlefield in eastern ukraine where for month the russian have tried to seize the city of bakhmut and the surrounding area suffering heavy casualty but gaining little ground in the past week the fighting ha been especially brutal in the nearby town of soledar going block to block and house to house with conflicting claim about control of the town nato ally that were once part of the soviet sphere have given their soviet era tank to ukraine but much of kyiv s fleet ha been destroyed or worn down by month of battle and it is running low on ammunition which is incompatible with western munition since the war began nearly a year ago the west ha resisted giving some of it most potent weapon to ukraine fearing that would bring nato into direct conflict with russia but seeing ukraine s determination to resist little prospect of peace talk anytime soon and a stalemate on the battlefield nato ally are relenting the patriot they recently agreed to are the most advanced american made air defense system and will help protect kyiv and other densely populated area from russian strike that have crippled ukraine s electricity grid the armored fighting vehicle approved last week are lighter and easier to maneuver on the battlefield than tank and can carry more troop but are not a powerful there are still some weapon not yet being considered including fighter jet and longer range missile that could hit occupied crimea and russia itself the biden administration leading the coalition of ally supplying ukraine with weapon is still holding back american made m abrams tank which require constant upkeep and special fuel and which official say are too scarce to spare but american official maintain they have never stood in the way of germany or any other nation sending western tank to ukraine there are an estimated german made leopard tank in more than a dozen military across europe some could be shipped quickly to ukraine if berlin approved though ukrainian crew would have to be trained in using them a senior western military official said this week that altering the balance of force in eastern ukraine is needed to break the stalemate in the war and that sending in enough modern western battle tank and other combat vehicle could help to tip that balance without tank a powerful component of ground warfare it is unlikely that ukraine will be able to win back significant amount of territory the official said at the pentagon laura k cooper a deputy assistant secretary of defense said last week at a briefing that we absolutely agree that ukraine doe need tank this is the right time for ukraine to take advantage of it capability to change the dynamic on the battlefield m cooper said ukraine is set on pushing forward with it own military offensive either in the depth of winter or after the muddy spring season russia too is telegraphing a spring offensive said a senior western intelligence official and ukraine doesn t want them to catch their breath between now and when that intensified round of combat begin camille grand a defense expert at the european council on foreign relation who stepped down a nato s assistant secretary general for defense investment late last year noted that moscow appears to be mobilizing hundred of thousand of new conscript for it offensive that in part pushed forward the debate about tank he said to enable the ukrainian force to achieve significant progress now part of the discussion mr grand said focused on whether the tank would give ukrainian force some sort of a decisive victory that would force peace on the russian or at least to achieve such significant progress that any negotiated settlement would be more on their term than on russian term the issue of whether to allow leopard to be sent to ukraine is likely to come to a head at a jan meeting of senior defense and military official from dozen of nation including nato state at ramstein air base in germany britain ha so far said it is considering sending a few a challenger tank to ukraine britain ha about challenger which have maintenance issue and it would be hard pressed to replenish it stock part of the internal debate among british official is political a senior european diplomat said rishi sunak the new prime minister want to take some leadership in the war and london and warsaw appear to be acting in concert to put pressure on berlin in a closed door session of his national security council on tuesday mr sunak outlined a strategy to increase support for ukraine likely beginning with the tank to give kyiv an edge ahead of any possible peace negotiation according to another senior european official but washington s explicit approval would be vital to pushing mr scholz to authorize the leopard a it wa crucial to the decision to send the german made fighting vehicle known a marders said claudia major a defense analyst with the german institute for international and security affair in berlin pressure on the leopard is rising from the pole the british and the finn but it s about one particular partner the united state which is more equal than the others she said with the ramstein meeting coming i expect it to happen soon a senior biden administration official said washington had not prodded berlin to send the tank to ukraine and that the german government would make it own decision about it level of military support speaking on the condition of anonymity to discus the sensitive issue more candidly he described the discussion between washington and berlin a very active and said the german like u have evolved their willingness to provide capability a the fight ha changed over time the united state ha not told ally to refrain from giving western tank to ukraine the official said the german regard such a stance a a cop out according to m major the analyst in berlin reflecting washington s own unwillingness to send any abrams tank to ukraine she ha said that just one abrams from washington would be enough to free mr scholz to act for now supporter of sending tank are focused on getting some country to make the first move norbert r ttgen an opposition german legislator and foreign policy expert predicted that mr scholz would give in on the leopard under pressure from ally a he did earlier with german made howitzer and tracked armored infantry fighting vehicle mr scholz and his party want to keep a relationship with russia and with putin for the future and think that if he give ukraine the best germany ha russia will perceive this a breaking a special relationship mr r ttgen said but pressure from ally is becoming too strong poland s president andrzej duda wa meeting monday with the prime minister and some of his minister to discus security issue amid the war in neighboring ukraine including kyiv s request for delivery of western made heavy battle tank a presidential aide said the request for german made leopard tank which poland among other country u will be on the agenda szrot stressed that such decision need to also take poland s security into account on saturday prime minister mateusz morawiecki said he and duda were involved in wider coalition international talk regarding heavy tank for ukraine but that warsaw would not proceed with potential delivery alone last week in it biggest military assistance package for ukraine the united state pledged among others bradley tank killing armored vehicle with missile germany also announced it would supply around marder armored personnel carrier and france promised wheeled amx rc tank destroyer the latest draw down package includes an array of military vehicle for combat like bradley fighting vehicle armored personnel carrier mine resistant ambush protected vehicle and high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy ha repeatedly pleaded with western ally to send his troop tank a brutal ground warfare persists in ukraine s eastern region particularly in luhansk and donetsk the main difference between the bradley fighting vehicle and the u s s m abrams tank is it lighter armor and cannon ability the defense official said it will take a couple of month to get the bradley vehicle operational in the field and ukraine s force trained up on the equipment roughly a battalion s worth of troop some soldier will be trained at a time over the course of a month sniper rifle machine gun ammunition for grenade launcher and small arm will also make their way from the u s to ukraine s front line caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news brussels they will soon be covered in mud riddled with shrapnel damage and under fire on ukraine s battlefield but the three new type of armored vehicle offered to ukraine this week signal that the western ally are gearing up for another bloody year a the war enters a new phase of ukrainian offensive against dug in russian force not surprisingly the ukrainian government is ecstatic the time of weapon taboo ha passed the foreign minister dmytro kuleba said in a facebook post welcoming the new lethal equipment russia is furious the new vehicle are another step toward an escalation of the ukrainian conflict the embassy in berlin decried in a statement and frontline troop are cynical often complaining that while the ally are not letting them lose they aren t letting them win either but the new weapon seem to mark a policy change in washington paris and berlin giving more lethal support to the ukrainian infantry indicating le anxiety about russian escalation and angling for more decisive ukrainian victory in the trilateral decision clarifies western support for ukraine for a potential offensive in the month to come said ulrich speck a german foreign policy analyst and it signal moscow that we re not on the trajectory to peace negotiation soon the decision also reflects a temperature change in major western capital and a reduction in the fear factor a sense that a diminished russia is le able or willing to escalate mr speck said the french amx s german marders and the u s m bradley fighting vehicle will enter the war on the heel of two successful ukrainian offensive that pushed russian force from the country s northeast and the south the new vehicle known a infantry or armored fighting vehicle are almost certainly intended to spearhead any future attempt to push the russian out of ukraine the ukrainian are planning to do more offensive operation against dug in russian position so getting better infantry fighting vehicle to get close to defensive position is important said rob lee a military analyst at the foreign policy research institute the new equipment will be arriving just in time after more than month of bloody fighting ukraine s soviet era vehicle that mirror the capability of the amx m and marder have been slowly destroyed and damaged according to ukrainian troop and a u s official but if not sent in large number the recent armored addition will likely change little on the broader battlefield and add to ukraine s growing logistics burden a ukrainian mechanic struggle with a diverse fleet of vehicle that each have their own part and ammunition requirement the trio of vehicle are not the first armored vehicle sent by the west to ukraine but they are arguably the most advanced occupying a category of war machine that are not quite armored personnel carrier though some can carry troop and not quite tank the amx ha a millimeter cannon the m bradley can be fitted with a millimeter cannon and an anti tank guided missile the marder is typically fitted with a millimeter gun the three different vehicle use different ammunition type meaning more of a logistics headache for the ukrainian troop using them the french one run on large tire the others on tread but the bradley and marder can both carry troop making them critical for any kind of future ukrainian offensive operation against russia s defense along a front line that stretch more than mile and ha in recent week mostly stabilized after being reinforced by newly mobilized troop ukraine ha been pressing it western ally regularly for more sophisticated infantry equipment including armored infantry fighting vehicle and top of the line western tank like the american abrams and the german leopard ii but washington paris and berlin have been cautious trying to provide the weapon ukraine actually need and is capable of maintaining while also keeping a wary eye on the depth of their own sometimes meager stockpile american official have argued that ukraine ha enough good tank in it soviet era t s though it is running short of ammunition for them the american and german argue that to train ukrainian to operate modern leopard or abrams tank and to maintain them in the field would take many month the logistics chain needed for a fuel guzzling tank like the abrams is also extensive added a u s official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discus tactical matter currently ukrainian force are using their soviet era tank in more of a support role keeping them protected behind the line and employing their large main gun like artillery they often rely on armored personnel carrier to move troop quickly in offensive maneuver on friday the biden administration announced a new billion package of military assistance for ukraine that includes bradley fighting vehicle which official said would be especially helpful to ukrainian unit fighting russian force in the donbas region of the country s east the administration said it would send bradley germany ha said it will provide marders the german coalition government led by a social democratic chancellor olaf scholz ha been especially careful to draw a line between defensive weapon like the gepard mobile antiaircraft vehicle which have tank tread and weapon that can be used for offensive infantry fighting like the marder and the leopard berlin ha maintained that it would not be the first nato ally to supply such weapon to ukraine president emmanuel macron of france ha held a similar stance if more quietly but on wednesday after discussion with ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky mr macron suddenly announced that france would supply it amx to ukraine an infantry fighting vehicle with wheel not tank tread in service since the s and being phased out in the french military a nato diplomat said on friday that france germany and the united state had been discussing providing ukraine with such vehicle including the american bradley and the german marder but that mr macron went ahead on his own and announced france s decision on thursday after a conversation between president biden and mr scholz the german said the american and german consulted and announced their own decision to supply bradley and marders satisfying the german condition that berlin not be the first to supply a new category of western weaponry to ukraine germany also announced that it would supply a patriot missile battery to ukraine in addition to the one that it wa supplying to poland and which it had initially refused to give directly to ukraine that taboo too ha now been broken it s another step forward for germany which ha been going one step at a time since feb said ulrike franke a german defense expert with the european council on foreign relation ukraine ha been asking for these weapon since april she said but for germany it wa a self imposed taboo in berlin we keep having these slightly absurd debate offensive versus defensive light versus heavy modern versus old and then a few month later we change our line again she said it s an important evolution mostly in the german imagination she said but it is also a bad look for the franco german relationship she said looking either like berlin need a push from paris or that the two country can t work well together with mr macron pre empting matter on his own welcome to the russia ukraine war briefing your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict for the first time the u s germany and france will each send armored fighting vehicle to ukraine a significant escalation in western military support after almost month of war the combat vehicle are not tank which president volodymyr zelensky ha requested for month but they will strengthen ukraine s capability on the battlefield military expert say they could also open the door to delivery of even more powerful weapon a ukraine warns of a planned russian offensive in the spring the announcement from paris berlin and washington signal that ukraine s ally are gearing up for another bloody year a the war enters a new phase of ukrainian offensive against dug in russian force my colleague steven erlanger and thomas gibbon neff report the biden administration today announced a new billion package of military assistance for ukraine that will include bradley fighting vehicle the bradley will offer ukrainian soldier greater protection and firepower than any of the truck or armored personnel carrier the west ha sent to date my colleague john ismay report the bradley can carry troop into battle and support them with a millimeter gun that can fire explosive round smaller than the gun of u s tank like the m abrams but still capable of taking out russian tank it s not a tank but it s a tank killer a pentagon spokesman said the u s will send of the vehicle according to an official germany and the u s will also supply kyiv with a second patriot missile battery germany s announcement that it would provide it marder infantry fighting vehicle wa a long awaited u turn chancellor olaf scholz had rejected ukraine s request for the vehicle out of concern that the delivery could drag nato into the war scholz argued that no other western country wa supplying them and that germany would not go it alone that argument appeared to fall to the wayside when france on wednesday announced delivery of it amx rc vehicle turning up pressure on germany to follow suit the u s and germany announced the contribution after a phone call between president biden and scholz the three vehicle are arguably the most advanced armored vehicle sent by the west to ukraine occupying a category of war machine that are not quite armored personnel carrier though some can carry troop nor are they tank the pentagon said that providing the bradley vehicle and the patriot air defense system had become more feasible because the war wa dragging on providing time to train ukrainian force to use them der spiegel reported that the decision to make the new delivery wa based on the analysis shared by the three ally that the ukrainian army needed more heavy equipment to break russian position in the south and east of the country germany will provide up to marders according to the report this year ukraine will receive weapon from the ally that it failed to get in ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba wrote in a facebook post the first week of prof it the time of weapon taboo ha passed follow our coverage

for reading i ll be back monday carole i appreciate france agreeing to provide light armored combat vehicle to ukraine but this is not enough graham tweeted the goal for is to give the ukrainian the weapon they need to militarily defeat the russian invader this requires heavy modern tank earlier this week zelenskyy renewed his call for western tank to help his troop in area like donetsk where brutal ground warfare continues fox news caitlin mcfall contributed to this report chris pandolfo is a writer for fox news digital send tip to chris pandolfo fox com and follow him on twitter chriscpandolfo the french defense ministry said thursday it will soon hold talk with it ukrainian counterpart to arrange for the delivery of armored combat vehicle in what france s presidency say will be the first time this type of western made wheeled tank destroyer will be given to the ukrainian military discussion will include the delivery timetable and the training of ukrainian soldier on the equipment the ministry said designated a light tank in french the amx rc carry a milimeter cannon and two machine gun it s primarily designed for reconnaissance mission and ha enough armor to protect against light infantry weapon according to the french defense ministry they have wheel rather than track allowing it to be more mobile than heavy tank ukraine ha for month sought to be supplied with heavier tank including the u s abrams and the german leopard tank the czech republic and poland have provided soviet era t tank to ukrainian force france s decision wa announced after an hour long call between french president emmanuel macron and zelenskyy wednesday afternoon the elysee declined to provide detail about the agreement the amx rc ha been in service with the french military since and ha undergone recent upgrade france s defense ministry said the combat vehicle is now being gradually replaced by the new equivalent named jaguar the decision is another in france s military support to ukraine following the french defense minister s visit to kyiv last week paris ha supplied ukraine with a substantial chunk of it arsenal of caesar cannon a well a anti tank missile crotale air defense missile battery and rocket launcher it is also training some ukrainian troop on french soil u s president joe biden said his administration is considering sending to ukraine bradley fighting vehicle a medium armored combat vehicle that can serve a a troop carrier biden wa asked during an exchange with reporter while traveling in kentucky whether providing the tracked armored fighting vehicle to ukraine wa on the table he responded yes without offering further comment the german government ha for month faced call from kyiv and some lawmaker at home to deliver leopard heavy tank to ukraine but ha said that it wouldn t go alone with such a move and that no other country ha supplied similar western equipment the co leader of chancellor olaf scholz s party saskia esken told n tv television thursday that scholz and the government are in regular and close contact with our partner with our friend of course particularly with the american on weapon delivery britain say it ha given ukraine more than armored vehicle for troop transport but no tank a of yet though the cannon on the bradley is significantly smaller than on the u s s m abrams tank which ha a mm cannon a opposed to a mm cannon roughly a difference in firing range of foot versus foot though the u s ha employed bradley fighting vehicle in war zone in the middle east it is unclear if zelenskyy would classify the vehicle a sufficient given it lighter armor and smaller cannon in an overnight address the ukrainian president once again renewed his call for western tank to help his troop in area like donetsk where brutal ground warfare continues the most intense fighting is still happening around the city of bakhmut which sits on a russian supply chain route though russia would gain relatively little in capturing the devastated city that ha been pummeled for month it could help russia gain a stronger foothold in the area and allow it to secure neighboring city battlefield in the donetsk region resemble something out of a world war one depiction with trench warfare and blackened landscape decimated by constant shelling fox news digital could not independently verify ukraine s wednesday death toll figure modern western armored vehicle western type tank are just one of these key capability he added france became the first western nation to commit to sending ukraine tank though it is unclear when kyiv can expect to receive the french made amx rc light tank the u s ha already provided ukraine with combat vehicle which include mine resistant ambush protected vehicle and more than humvee caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news russian specialist are improving military equipment and continue to create new weapon that have no analogue in the world one of these vehicle is the t armata tank which is now undergoing combat coordination at russian training ground journalist and tv presenter vladimir solovyov on december showed a video of the combat coordination of a tank battalion equipped with armata the tv presenter said that he would not name the exact place where the military are trained but noted a significant number of combat vehicle that work at the training ground not only alone but also together i will not say what exactly the armata ha of weapon but this will be an extremely unpleasant surprise for any troop who try to stand in our way and what is important we are not talking about a single copy but about a significant number of tank that will determine the nature of the battle in certain area solovyov said on the tv channel russia especially for the radio komsomolskaya pravda the military observer of the kp ru viktor baranets revealed the feature of the unique tank and told about it main chip according to the expert armata is a tank manager which ha no equal i had the honor to be the first russian military journalist who wa allowed by the minister of defense to visit this tank i wrote about it in kp i wa a tank driver in my first life a a soldier when i climbed into the armata the first impression wa something like if i had moved from a rural tractor one with such lever everywhere into the cab of a modern superliner i didn t see any wheel no lever no brake no throttle the instructor who wa with me say you are behind in life you work with a joystick said viktor nikolaevich now the t according to solovyov is on combat coordination what s next this tank ha been tested for a long time and i think he s slowly going to be pulled up to the battlefield our tester are now killing it at russian training ground in various mode in cold hot in mud in sand and so on said colonel baranets the first difference between this tank and all classic tank is that the crew is separate from the shell if an enemy shell hit an ordinary tank it explodes the crew explodes here the crew is separated by powerful armor from shell shell are supplied automatically the soldier pressed the button the commander took aim and fired it all work the tank ha a mighty engine and it can be horse and maybe he ha an interesting millimeter gun which while the tank is being tested can develop into a millimeter from the same gun you can shoot a guided missile this tank ha very powerful protection first dynamic protection the hull of the tank is lined with special plate when the american javelin fly up to our armata then perhaps even this plate will fly towards it at the very last moment or this plate will explode along with the warhead of the javelin and the crew will not be harmed maybe it will only shake well there say the military observer another feature of armata is the afghanit system when the supostat shoot at the t tank the afghanit system instantly detects the shell that fly into the tank and she sends her projectile towards him which either blow him up or knock him off the trajectory but that s not all any tank ha the weakest point the turret both javelin and aircraft missile are trying to aim there and then our golden head from the defense industry were provided they put here not only an automatic anti aircraft machine gun but also a system that will be able to reflect the shell that fly into the turret of the tank i don t know of any other tank in the world like the armata that is so stuffed with electronics when i talked to the designer they made a tank someone trucked someone engined someone cannon someone boiled steel they themselves were amazed that the result wa an intelligent tank this tank will appear on the battlefield not just a a combat unit it will be a network centric tank because it will observe the situation on the battlefield and transmit to the t or t tank both the position on the battlefield and the target that these tank must destroy in the first place the armata will also shoot we get the t not just a combat hardware which ha the peculiarity of tactical and technical characteristic but also a tank manager baranets summed up in an interview with journalist of the radio komsomolskaya pravda listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year an attempted attack on the svatovo kremennaya line in the lugansk people s republic ended deplorably for the armed force of ukraine fighter of the russian military group o brave central military district used combat tank support vehicle bmpt terminator their fire terrified the ukrainian militant and forced them to flee their position the ukrainian army ha been trying to break through the front in the svatovo area for several month this city is of strategic importance behind it open the way to the depth of the lpr including to severodonetsk and lisichansk svatovo is constantly shelled from highmars ukrainian troop almost daily feel the defense trying to break through the front now these attempt among other military equipment are opposed by the bmpt terminator the situation is tense but we are holding the front line destroying the enemy s stronghold with artillery tank and heavy fire system solntsepek the russian military said when repelling several attack the terminator helped u a lot he literally turned the enemy into flight bmpt terminator is called tank on steroid or helicopter on caterpillar produced by uralvagonzavod the terminator were adopted by the russian army a recently a although the development began in the s these machine are assembled on the basis of the t tank but they are much more maneuverable and able to quickly respond to the threat of attack from anti tank system in the protection of tank in fact is the main task of the terminator they can detect and quickly hit even a fighter with a javelin who ha settled somewhere in the bush at the same time according to expert thanks to the dynamic protection of the relikt the terminator itself is not so terrible anti tank missile mainly because the relikt protects the entire perimeter of the vehicle not just a degree sector like the t tank the armament of the bmpt terminator and these are two millimeter gun a four launcher of guided missile m attack two ag grenade launcher and a mm modernized kalashnikov tank machine gun allows you to conduct a single battle this apparently contributed to the success of tank support combat vehicle near svatovo according to the above mentioned military of the central military district the terminator and artillery inflicted a massive blow on the area of concentration of ukrainian militant in the forest plantation from where they were going to attack russian position the fire wa corrected from a drone which managed to capture the reaction of the ukrainian many remained forever in the forest plantation and the rest preferred to flee throwing heavy weapon listen a well will the fourth offensive of the armed force of ukraine take place brussels a bitter political and diplomatic rift between germany and poland both important member of the european union and nato ha worsened a russia s war in ukraine ha ground on undermining cohesion and solidarity in both organization the toxic nature of the relationship wa underscored recently by a german offer to provide two battery of scarce and expensive patriot air defense missile to poland after a ukrainian missile strayed off course and killed two pole last month in the little town of przewodow poland initially accepted the offer of the patriot then rejected it they then insisted that the battery be put in ukraine a nonstarter for nato since the missile system would be operated by nato personnel after considerable allied concern and public criticism the pole now seem to have accepted the missile again this whole story is like an x ray of miserable polish german relation said michal baranowski the regional managing director of the german marshall fund in warsaw it s worse than i thought and i ve watched it a long time poland ha long been wary of germany hitler s invasion in wa the start of world war ii it wa also critical of germany s policy of ostpolitik the cold war effort at rapprochement with moscow and the country of eastern and central europe occupied by the soviet union democratic poland consistently criticized german dependency on russian energy and the two nord stream pipeline that were designed to take cheap russian gas directly to germany and bypass poland and ukraine the russian invasion of ukraine ha only intensified the view in poland that germany s close relation with russia and president vladimir v putin were not just na ve but selfish and possibly just on hold rather than permanently sundered both side have made mistake in the current dispute said jana puglierin the berlin director of the european council on foreign relation the relationship ha been deteriorating for year but it s peaking now and doing real damage she said there is a gap emerging between europe s east and west old europe and new europe and that s beneficial only for vladimir putin germany thought this gesture of military help would be an offer that wa too good to be refused and would help convince pole that germany is a reliable ally said a senior german diplomat who would speak only anonymously in accordance with diplomatic practice after all he said the pole themselves are trying to buy patriot a surface to air antimissile system so we wanted to make this government s caricature of germany more hollow but after the polish defense minister and president quickly accepted the offer jaroslaw kaczynski the powerful year old leader of poland s governing law and justice party rejected it just two day later not only did he insist that the patriot go to ukraine but he suggested that germany which he regularly attack a siding with russia over poland and whose soldier would be operating the patriot would not dare to confront russia germany s attitude so far give no reason to believe that they will decide to shoot at russian missile mr kaczynski said mr kaczynski ha no formal role in the polish government but the defense minister mariusz blaszczak fell into line within hour poland s president andrzej duda from the same party and who is also poland s commander in chief wa embarrassed by the painfully obvious display of his powerlessness nato ally were quietly furious precisely because the patriot would be operated by german soldier and the defense bloc ha made it clear that it will not deploy troop to ukraine and risk a nato russian war any decision to send patriot to ukraine germany said would have to be a nato decision not a bilateral one kaczynski knew this and wa being totally cynical said piotr bura the warsaw director of the european council on foreign relation everyone knew the german would not and could not send patriot to ukraine and of course there are no polish soldier in ukraine either the only explanation for mr kaczynski s response is political mr baranowski of the german marshall fund said since poland is in an electoral campaign and the party s support ha been slipping with election scheduled for next autumn law and justice is reinforcing it base and criticism of germany is a constant party line he said some analyst detected a political motive on the german side a well the offer by berlin so soon after the death of the pole wa clearly a german effort to have a win in the bitter toxic polish german diplomatic war said wojciech przybylski chief editor of visegrad insight and president of the warsaw based re publica foundation a research institution and it also harm kaczynski s electoral strategy even so for poland s leading politician and head of the ruling coalition to say that he ha no trust in germany a an ally wa shocking mr baranowski said if mismanaged this can hurt alliance unity beyond the two country i ve never seen security instrumentalized in this way in this toxic mixture but germany decided to keep the offer open the german diplomat said and opinion poll showed that a large percentage of pole thought that having german patriot in poland wa a good idea on tuesday night the polish government shifted it position again mr blaszczak the defense minister announced that after further talk with berlin he disappointedly accepted that the missile would not go to ukraine adding we are beginning working arrangement on deploying the launcher in poland and making them part of our command system but the bitterness will persist and few expect mr kaczynski and his party to stop questioning german sincerity only in october for instance warsaw suddenly demanded germany pay reparation for world war ii calculating trillion in wartime loss an issue that berlin said had been settled in but the criticism of german hesitancy toward helping ukraine and of france s early willingness to push for peace talk at ukraine s expense is not limited to poland but is also prevalent in central eastern and northern europe although le charged there is a lot of talk about western and e u unity and cooperation on ukraine but at the same time this war ha triggered a significant wave of criticism of western europe in poland and the baltic said mr bura of the european council on foreign relation it deepened the skepticism and criticism especially of germany and france and fed a sense of moral superiority toward them that we re on the right side and they were on the wrong side he said and it ha deepened mistrust about security cooperation with them that we can t rely on them but only on the u s and the u k the polish debate mix two thing he said first there is a ruthless political instrumentalization of germany by law and justice it s incredible how they portray germany a an enemy and berlin a dangerous to poland a moscow that berlin want russia to win and is not really helping ukraine at all but beyond the crude propaganda mr bura said there is a failure in poland to recognize that there is a post invasion realization in berlin that war ha come back to europe that germany need to rearm and ha become far too dependent on russian energy and chinese trade poland may not be the only country criticizing germany over ukraine m puglierin said but on another level it s the political layer in poland toxic and nasty law and justice jump on this german hesitation and use it for domestic political reason and i think it will only get worse before the election at the very time when unity is useful there is one brighter spot of cooperation earlier this month the two country signed an agreement to work to ensure the future of the giant schwedt refinery a german facility that had processed russian oil now under sanction sophia besch a german analyst with the carnegie endowment insisted that germany had changed since the russian invasion she pointed to the sharp change in policy toward a stronger military and more economic resilience the zeitenwende or historical turning point announced by chancellor olaf scholz scholz is much more committed to listening to central european country she said i believe our romance with russia is over
