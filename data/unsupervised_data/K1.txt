for all even a ukrainian and russian leader predicted that the fall of bakhmut could open the way for a broader russian offensive the u s intelligence chief said wednesday that the kremlin s force were too depleted by a year of war to wage such a campaign the chief of the wagner mercenary group which ha spearheaded the grueling street by street russian assault on bakhmut the besieged city in eastern ukraine said on wednesday that his force had taken the eastern part of the city seizing the rest would allow russia to accelerate it offensive across more open terrain he said the world ha not yet met a well prepared russian army their unit possessing all of the possible modern equipment that have not yet joined the battle the wagner chief yevgeny v prigozhin said in a video message speaking next to a world war ii memorial in bakhmut a explosion thundered in the distance similarly president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said in a cnn interview that we understand that after bakhmut they could go further he said it would be open road for the russian after bakhmut to other town in ukraine but testifying in washington before the senate intelligence committee avril d haines the director of national intelligence argued that russia having suffered and inflicted staggering loss in ukraine lacked the troop and the ammunition to make major advance this year and she said it battered force had a serious morale problem russia ha reportedly turned to north korea for artillery shell and ha bought attack drone from iran if russia doe not initiate a mandatory mobilization and identify substantial third party ammunition supply it will be increasingly challenging for them to sustain the current level of offensive operation in the coming month m haines said and consequently they may fully shift to holding and defending territory they occupy in short we do not foresee the russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gain each side in the war claimed this week that the battle for bakhmut which ha resulted in ten of thousand of casualty ha been playing a vital role in weakening the enemy russia ha poured enormous resource into the fight including wagner s tactic of sending wave of former prison inmate in near suicide assault the ukrainian have held on tenaciously and claimed on tuesday that the blood bath would leave wagner a spent force despite persistent rumor of withdrawal they sent reinforcement to the city this week it is not only russia whose resource are waning ukraine with one third a many people a russia can le easily absorb casualty and ukrainian force too are chronically short of artillery ammunition firing shell and rocket far faster than western nation can supply them european union defense minister met on wednesday to discus the need to ramp up production of artillery ammunition to send to ukraine though no decision were made until an increase get underway the e u leadership ha proposed spending more than billion to reimburse member nation for ammunition sent from their own stock it s not going to be short said josep borrell fontelles the e u s chief foreign policy official but the sooner we start the better the nato nation have remained remarkably united in support of ukraine though that unity might be challenged by news about the sabotage of the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea the line delivering russian gas to germany were badly damaged by explosion in september and western country have not identified a culprit the new york time reported on tuesday that new intelligence cited by u s official suggests that a pro ukrainian group had carried out the attack the official did not offer any more description of the group it affiliation or it backer other than to say that the saboteur did not appear to have been working for a national military or intelligence agency ukraine s government ha denied involvement ukraine ha nothing to do with the baltic sea mishap mykhailo podolyak a senior adviser to mr zelensky said on twitter any suggestion of ukrainian involvement could undermine pro ukrainian sentiment particularly in germany which wa highly dependent on russian gas before the war the nord stream attack caused energy price to spike worldwide and forced europe to make hurried arrangement to prevent a winter shortage of fuel german official on wednesday made it clear that they had not reached any conclusion about responsibility and that they were awaiting the result of further investigation boris pistorius the defense minister said without elaborating that the attack could also have been a false flag action to make it appear that it had been carried out by pro ukrainian group the likelihood of either is equally high he told a german public broadcaster for now the nato alliance is presenting a mostly solid pro ukrainian front western official have long questioned the strategic value of bakhmut now a blasted largely abandoned ruin of what wa once a city of people and insist that if it doe fall to the russian that will have little effect on the course of the war the nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said in brussels on wednesday that we cannot rule out that bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming day but it loss he said would not prove decisive the u s defense secretary lloyd j austin iii said monday that if ukrainian force pulled back to some very defensible terrain near the city i would not view that a an operational or a strategic setback m haines the intelligence director described russian advance in bakhmut a incremental progress and the city itself a not a particularly strategic objective but the two warring side have staked enormous resource and pride on the fight for the city western official estimate that up to russian soldier have been killed or wounded in and around bakhmut ukrainian casualty are also believed to be high but western official refuse to give estimate mr zelensky told cnn that russia need at least some victory a small victory even by ruining everything in bakhmut just killing every civilian there that way he said moscow can portray it military to it own people a powerful and successful m haines wa at the senate on wednesday to present the u s intelligence community s annual global threat assessment it warned that there is real potential for russia s military failure in the war to hurt russian president vladimir putin s domestic standing and thereby trigger additional escalatory action by russia in an effort to win back public support the kremlin ha illegally declared annexation of four ukrainian province and control the majority of that territory m haines testified that mr putin may now see a drawn out war even one that is temporarily stalemated a his best option in that she is in agreement with ukrainian official who want to mount a counteroffensive soon fearing that the longer the russian hold the region the harder they will be to dislodge even a the russian offensive continues they are experiencing high casualty rate m haines said putin is likely better understanding the limit of what his military is capable of achieving and appears to be focused on more limited military objective for now german defense minister boris pistorius ha dodged a question about how the nord stream sabotage case could influence western military aid for kiev if it turn out that pro ukrainian group were behind the russian gas pipeline blast it is of no use to speculate on hypothetical indication the minister told national news radio deutschlandfunk dlf on wednesday following

little sense to think about what impact this would have on our support for ukraine on the basis of such a journalistic investigation when asked about the potential fallout of a probe into the nord stream sabotage the minister said that germany and it ally continue to supply kiev to the best of our ability he added though that ukraine s western backer can only provide ammunition for the

mill took aim at president biden for his handling of the u s withdrawal from afghanistan arguing the president placed political optic over military strategy in the chaotic final month of america s longest war biden s administration originally said they d be out by sept trying to utilize this date for political optic above military strategy mill r fla told fox news digital tuesday mill a veteran of the army s nd airborne division who spent seven year in iraq and nearly three year in afghanistan became personally involved in the withdrawal mission despite running a congressional campaign at the time mill assembled a team to help him evacuate an american mother from texas and her three child who were stranded in afghanistan but when the team mill assembled attempted to land in afghanistan for the extraction they were denied the ability to use the runway they had previously been approved for subsequent attempt to land were also denied with american leader on the ground threatening to arrest the passenger if they landed and revoke the license of the pilot they duped a taliban guard by convincing him that the woman wa his wife and the child were his mill added the congressman said such extraordinary measure would not have been necessary if the withdrawal from afghanistan were better planned pointing to the closure of bagram air base a an example of failed leadership mill also pointed to the release of thousand of known terrorist from bagram detention center arguing the decision led to the deadly aug attack on american force at an airport gate in kabul killing u s service member i think the critical failure wa always the idea of putting politics and optic above strategy that the real intent wasn t just to try and save all the american or ally who we ve made promise to over the past two plus decade mill said the administration quickly began boasting about the most successful airlift operation in u s history but left many american and ally behind while to of those evacuated from kabul were never vetted mill said worse yet mill argued the chaotic failure of the final day of america s longest war could have been avoided had the administration stuck to the term of the deal bargained with the taliban under the trump administration he noted that former secretary of state mike pompeo had set condition for what the taliban had to do in order for american force to leave and those obligation were not being met despite that biden broadcast the u s timeline withdrawal to the taliban i think we made some critical and fatal flaw not to mention the fact that one of the grand flaw in my opinion is that you left plus billion dollar in weapon and armor defense article and million of dollar and pallet of cash mill said mill argued the blame for the failure fall on biden who a commander in chief had the final say in all decision made this botched withdrawal ultimately led to our adversary coming more aggressive toward u because they looked at this a a massive failure on a world stage level and we know that weakness invite aggression mill argued mill pointed out that not only will afghanistan be allowed to become a safe haven for terrorism once again but also that the ramification are already being felt when it come to dealing with other geopolitical foe such a china and russia there s truly a lot that ha come out of this that ha essentially damaged our credibility on the world stage and make many of our ally and others look at u and whether we re truly a world leader any longer mill said mill argued that hearing beginning this week taking place after the republican takeover of congress this year are an opportunity to examine the critical question surrounding the failure in afghanistan while giving the american people answer on what went wrong in the war s final day his comment followed claim by russia s mercenary wagner group which said it had taken the eastern part of the city after month of a brutal ground and air offensive fox

week which were likewise rejected by russia and china brussels when the european union offered ukraine a path to membership last year it wa in many way an emotional response to the russian invasion leader were under pressure to show solidarity with the victim of aggression even though many opposed the idea since then preoccupied with passing sanction scrounging up aid and scouring military inventory to send ukraine weapon few in europe have focused seriously on what that commitment might actually mean but this is a courtship with consequence for the future not only for ukraine s aspiration and survival but also for europe s own security and finance ukrainian membership would reshape the bloc and it relationship with a post conflict russia it would also provide the best path toward internal ukrainian reform a the country worked to meet e u standard of transparency and rule of law but tension are already growing between europe s desire to maintain it tough requirement and ukraine s demand for quick entry into a promised land that ha given hope to the embattled country european union official like ursula von der leyen the president of the european commission have been slow walking expectation for ukraine a country that nearly all agree is fundamentally unprepared to join now there s more sympathy and the feeling that ukraine is a part of europe but that s sentimental and not hard core said anna wieslander of sweden director for northern europe for the atlantic council organization what s the plan ahead that s what i m missing she added there s no discussion of what the membership criterion in a new situation should be or what kind of union we get then we re putting our head in the sand european official say quietly that there is no real way around the current demanding process of accession which normally take many year and that assumes an independent post conflict ukraine with strong security guarantee or assurance which many think can only come with nato membership too one thing is clear restoring a shattered ukraine and bringing it fully into the european fold will be expensive turning some country from net receiver from the e u budget to net provider it also promise to shift europe s center of gravity eastward in way that could fundamentally change the balance of power in the bloc the consequence of ukraine in the e u will be complicated even explosive said thomas gomart director of ifri the french institute of international relation but it will be politically impossible to reject it after all ukraine is fighting on europe s behalf not just it own it is ukraine that is now defending nato s border let alone western value analyst pointed out ukraine is waging europe s war said steven e sokol president of the american council on germany europe owes ukraine a lot more urgency the time for piecemeal decision is long past argues sven biscop of egmont a brussels think tank accepting a neighbor under invasion a a candidate for membership must mean accepting more responsibility for that neighbor s survival he said if ukraine survives mr biscop said it will be an integral part of the western security architecture the new frontier with russia not merely the buffer state it ha been after a year of war he said the european union should finally come up with an overall plan to provide military support over the long term gradually taking over from the united state but for europe that will require a wrenching shift in mentality that ha barely begun since the founding of what became the european union after world war ii european integration ha been seen a a peace project said ylva johansson the e u commissioner for home affair the e u wa intended to be a project to make war impossible on the european continent she said in many way it succeeded a it and nato took in member of the former soviet bloc providing development security and more prosperity to million people but the biggest conflict since world war ii is now raging in europe ukraine also show that brussels and the peace project have failed said heather a conley president of the german marshall fund brussels and washington did not understand what their outreach to ukraine for eventual membership in nato and the european union would spark in president vladimir v putin of russia in m von der leyen announced that she would lead a geopolitical commission to learn to use the language of power but comprehending the need for the bloc to think and act a a global player is quite different from doing so there is an understanding of the need but an inability to meet the moment which is a geopolitical moment m conley said europe shifted east with an enlargement process that needed to be geopolitical from the start but became technical they lost their way the european union ha nonetheless coalesced impressively since the invasion it ha sharply cut dependency on russian energy especially natural gas it approved package of sanction against russia it reduced two way trade with russia by billion euro about billion while providing ukraine with more than billion in financial and humanitarian aid and billion in military support noted valdis dombrovskis the commissioner for trade according to the kiel institute which track aid to ukraine the european have earmarked some billion about billion for ukraine while the united state ha committed billion billion of it military despite all the criticism of brussels a slow to act e u institution have provided the second largest amount of total aid at billion while germany is the third largest donor country after the united state and britain m johansson emphasized that the commission which is traditionally stuffed with lawyer who draft regulation wa learning to be operational for example transforming an existing mechanism to reimburse member state for their military contribution to ukraine brussels ha committed to supporting the government in kyiv with billion a month for a year mr dombrovskis said matching washington s contribution with more to be added by multinational financial institution but those figure will be trifling compared with the cost of reconstruction estimated already at trillion let alone of eventual ukrainian membership in the union and there are already minority voice in the bloc that are anxious over the cost and it possible political impact a sanna marin the prime minister of finland said at the munich security conference last month i m worried about the resilience of e u citizen there are division in many country in europe people are frustrated with high inflation high energy price and say the war must end it s causing too much trouble politician must be clear about their commitment to support ukraine a long a necessary she said but the next year will be difficult and not just the next year but many year to come having offered ukraine a path to membership the european will be expected to take more responsibility for it reconstruction and institutional transformation from a relatively corrupt post soviet state into a european democracy clean enough to join the bloc the american will say we took care of the war now you take care of the reconstruction said camille grand a former senior nato official now with the european council on foreign relation however exaggerated that is the expectation in the american congress he noted the group of industrialized country ha set up an agency for reconstruction but the european will have to play a central role both in financing it and in guiding ukraine to revamp it institution and reduce corruption a happened with the post soviet country of central and eastern europe it is likely that ukraine with it history of corruption and oligarchic rule will be able to join nato before it qualifies to join the european union given that said stefan kornelius the foreign editor of the german daily s ddeutsche zeitung the big issue will be how to give ukraine political guarantee below membership level since the promise of e u membership is the main hope that keep them alive the process of e u accession is the best guarantee that ukraine will reform and will use reconstruction aid efficiently said radoslaw sikorksi a member of the european parliament and former foreign and defense minister of poland ukraine is already receiving e u pre accession fund which will grow that will be hundred of billion over a decade and that will be ukraine s real marshall plan mr sikorski said and if security is assured private investment will flow in he said he is optimistic about ukraine s eventual future in europe a an exporter of carbon free nuclear energy a huge and fertile agricultural power and a source of adaptable computer technology he said i think

washington had examined the evidence and vowed that the alleged perpetrator would be held to account russian ambassador to the u anatoly antonov reacted by saying the vice president s claim were a cynical attempt to escalate the ukraine conflict and justify effort to keep pouring weapon into kiev he pointed out too that the u had ignored ukrainian crime including the shelling of civilian area

announced an additional million in military aid to ukraine washington ha given kiev more than billion worth of arm and ha allocated over billion in aid since the conflict began russia ha argued that nato aid to ukraine is only prolonging the crisis and causing more bloodshed i have been wrestling with the issue of russophobia in the u for some time now a someone who studied russian history in college and who at an early stage in my development a an adult had the opportunity to live and work in russia during the soviet era i have a deep yet admittedly incomplete appreciation for russia s culture language and history this appreciation ha helped me to make judgment about the country it political leadership and it people especially when assessing the interaction between russia and america today without this background i would expect that i would be susceptible to the russophobia emanating from the u government and echoed without question by a compliant mainstream american medium with it i am able to see through the falsehood and mischaracterizations that appear deliberately designed to warp the sensibility and logic of russophobia s intended audience the american people recently i ran across an essay that had been published by the ambassador of russia to the u anatoly antonov in the russian newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta and subsequently posted on the russian embassy facebook page the title of the essay russophobia a a malignant tumor in the united state is admittedly provocative a all good thought provoking title should be after reading it it became apparent to me that in the interest of combating the trend i should help bring the ambassador s essay to the attention of a many people a possible russia the essay open ha always venerated and respected the rich cultural tradition of all country this is the core of our national identity mentality and statehood culture must always remain the bridge for strengthening trust between the people however complicated the relation between the state may be there wa no cancellation of culture even during the cold war a lesser known fact is that the first tchaikovsky international competition in wa won by van cliburn an outstanding pianist and u s national his sensational performance in moscow at the height of the cold war helped break down barrier and gave hope for finding mutual understanding based on love for classical music the story of how harvey lavan van cliburn a tall curly haired texan pianist conquered moscow is legendary by u soviet relation were tense impacted a they were by the politics of the cold war to promote a thaw in relation the soviet and american proposed a series of cultural exchange the soviet for their part convened the first international tchaikovsky piano competition named after the famous russian composer pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky tchaikovsky is perhaps best known in the united state for his rousing overture the melodic nutcracker suite once a christmas staple and the unforgettable swan lake ballet the premise of the competition wa to invite musician from country to compete in an international competition designed to highlight soviet accomplishment in the art a distinguished jury headed by dmitry shostakovich a legendary composer in his own right wa convened to judge the competition cliburn wa one of several american invited to compete his rendition of tchaikovsky s first piano concerto considered one of his most popular composition and a such familiar to all leaving little room for error or misinterpretation brought the crowd to it foot olga kern one of russia s finest classical pianist said of the performance van cliburn won because he played in a grand way soaring it wa beautiful the piano wa singing it sounded so new and fresh it wa incredible popular legend ha it that shostakovich wa uncertain whether he could award first prize to an american when the famed soviet composer approached nikita khrushchev for advice the soviet leader asked is he the best shostakovich replied yes to which khruschev announced then give him the prize van cliburn returned to america a hero and wa given a ticker tape parade down new york city s avenue of hero the only musician ever to be so honored time magazine put him on it cover with the headline the texan who conquered russia six month prior to van cliburn s achievement the soviet had put the world s first satellite sputnik into orbit an act that left many american feeling vulnerable and uncertain the country still reeled from the red scare politics of senator joe mccarthy whose admonition that you cannot offer friendship to tyrant and murderer without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder continued to resonate in certain circle even after his death in van cliburn s performance did in fact help break down barrier and give hope for finding mutual understanding there s no lie in the essay penned by the russian diplomat cultural cooperation the ambassador s essay noted helped melt the ice then it significance cannot be overestimated also in our day because the universal language of art unites people of different nationality whatever is going on in the realm of big politics it wa in short an historic event one worthy of continued attention and recognition and largely because of the singular accomplishment of van cliburn the international tchaikovsky competition went on to become one of the best known and most respected music competition in the world the competition the essay observed wa excluded from the world federation of international music competition in amidst indiscriminate russophobia this too is a true statement on april the world federation of international music competition voted by an overwhelming majority to exclude the international tchaikovsky competition from it membership in a press release the federation declared that many laureate of the tchaikovsky competition are among the leading artist of today however in the face of russia s brutal war and humanitarian atrocity in ukraine the federation a an apolitical organization cannot support or have a a member a competition financed and used a a promotional tool by the russian regime in following the invasion of iraq by the united state an act widely acknowledged worldwide a a blatant act of aggression that violated international law the van cliburn international piano competition one of six american music competition that are part of a network of some internationally recognized organization that comprise the federation and whose collective goal is to discover the most promising young talent in classical music through public competition wa not excluded by the world federation of international music competition so much for the apolitical status of the federation the exclusion by the federation of the international tchaikovsky competition is an inherently political act a clear example of russophobia to pretend otherwise is illogical but then again russophobia the fear or dislike of russia and it people often based on stereotype and propaganda like all other phobia is inherently illogical representing a it doe an excessive extreme irrational fear or panic reaction derived from ignorance of the subject in question and yet antonov declared despite that representative of the united state still seek to become laureate and winner of this prestigious contest the tchaikovsky international youth competition by the way wa attended by gifted performer from country including the united state again not a false statement the xi international tchaikovsky competition for young musician wa held in moscow and st petersburg in january there young musician from russia china the republic of korea and the united state were selected for participation in the final round the top two spot were awarded to competitor from china while the third spot went to a russian performer but american were there participating and that is what matter russian artist are considered among the world s most accomplished and many of their work can be found in art gallery around the world and yet even here russophobia ha raised it ugly head a the russian essay so pointedly note the anti russian hate virus is giving metastasis and continues to affect the united state the essay state it ha also infected the leading u art gallery that are now trying to outdo each other in their effort to cancel russian culture the metropolitan museum of art ambassador antonov report ha reclassified great russian painter arkhip kuindzhi ivan aivazovsky and ilya repin a ukrainian guided by the fact that they were born in mariupol feodosia and chuguev which is nothing short of a complete absurdity once again the assertion put forward in the essay is factually correct the met continually research and examines object in it collection in order to determine the most appropriate and accurate way to catalogue and present them a met spokesperson said commenting on the reclassification the cataloguing of these work ha been updated following research conducted in collaboration with scholar in the field the collaboration the met speaks of came in the form of online pressure from someone the met described a a ukrainian art historian oksana semenik whose twitter account ukrainian art history ukr arthistory ran a concerted campaign criticizing the met for incorrectly labelling the work of arkhip kuindzhi a russian all his famous landscape were about ukraine dnipro and steppe semenik tweeted but also about ukrainian people all his famous landscape were about ukraine dnipro and steppe but also about ukrainian people the head of a ukrainian peasant in a straw hat sunset chumaks path in mariupol steppe pic twitter com h yvkj q ukrainian art history ukr arthistory january but a the ambassador s essay point out this doe not withstand any criticism at least because the artist considered themselves russian just in case ethnically ilya repin wa russian ivan aivazovsky wa armenian and arkhip kuindzhi wa greek all three were born in the russian empire when ukrainian statehood did not exist kuindzhi wa a landscape painter from the russian empire of pontic greek origin when he wa born in the city of mariupol wa one of the subdivision of the yekaterinoslav governorate of the russian empire the landscape he painted at the time they were produced depicted russian scene and russian people kuindzhi by any account wa a russian artist while ivan aivazovsky may have been ethnically armenian he and all of russia considered and considers him to be an iconic romantic painter who is considered one of the greatest master of marine art of all time indeed several of aivazovsky s work hang in ambassador antonov s residence in washington dc prior to the reclassification the met described aivazovsky a such the russian romantic artist ivan konstantinovich aivazovsky wa widely renowned for his painting of sea battle shipwreck and storm at sea born into an armenian family in the crimean port city of feodosia aivazovsky wa enormously prolific he claimed to have created some six thousand painting during his lifetime he wa a favorite of tsar nicholas i and wa appointed official artist of the russian imperial navy a for ilya repin his father had served in an uhlan regiment in the russian army and repin wa a graduate of the imperial academy of fine art in saint petersburg the russophobia of the met did not stop there a antonov s essay note another example of ignorance by the met is the renaming of edgar degas s russian dancer to dancer in ukrainian dress this is true moreover in introducing the work the met declared in degas produced a series of composition devoted to dancer in ukrainian folk dress ignoring the fact that degas himself named the drawing russian dancer thereby reflecting the reality that he wa devoting his drawing to dancer in russian folk dress but historical accuracy is not apparently what the met aspires to a ambassador antonov explains moreover a comment added beneath the picture now read the subject reflects the surge of french interest in the art and culture of ukraine then part of the russian empire following france s political alliance with that empire in those who came up with this idea did not bother to figure out that it wa dancer of the russian imperial ballet on tour in paris who inspired the french impressionist to create the masterpiece it is na ve to imagine the ambassador note caustically that the artist wa familiar with the great ukrainian choreographic school anatoly antonov lambasts the decision of the met to cancel russian art history in the name of virtue signaling the american museum of modern art his essay note ha also yielded to the derangement dedicating a permanent collection gallery to work by ethnic ukranian titled in solidarity it feature piece by kazimir malevich leonid berlyavsky nevelson sonia delaunay terk and ilya kabakov kazimir malevich wa an ethnic pole born in kiev in and widely considered a leading russian avant garde artist and art theorist malevich s pioneering work had a profound influence on the development of abstract art in the th century his art and associated politics ran afoul of joseph stalin and malevich suffered persecution at the hand of the kgb before dying in leningrad in the ukrainian art historian turned activist oksana semenik led an online campaign to have the met reclassify malevich a ukrainian russian art critic who had access to the kgb archive she tweeted without referencing either the art critic or the archival material in question note that malevich answered that he wa ukrainian when asked about his nationality russian art critic who had access to the kgb archive note that malevich answered that he wa ukrainian when asked about his nationality self portrait pic twitter com sou vtiihx ukrainian art history ukr arthistory february semenik went on to tweet so museummodernart how about making correction about his true nationality it will be a present for his birthday note malevich wa born on february a modicum of due diligence however of the sort one would expect from an institution such a the metropolitan museum of art where assiduous accuracy in the pursuit of art history is the norm not the exception appears to be lacking in the case of m semenik far from a simple art historian semenik is what she call a cultural journalist whose article have been published in outlet such a the new statesman a british political and cultural magazine with a decidedly pro ukraine anti russia editorial bias on april the new statesman published an article authored by semenik entitled i escaped russian atrocity in bucha my neighbor weren t so lucky the account of m semenik is what it is and it is important to note that she provides no first hand observation of so called russian atrocity what is more interesting is her naming of her partner sashko popenko and the name of the person who edited and translated the article into english nataliya gumenyuk both are journalist working for the public interest journalism lab which in wa awarded the democracy award from the national endowment for democracy ned an organization formed in during the reagan administration to assume control of cia program operating overseas designed to influence international public private opinion and policy the ned is funded by an annual grant from the united state information agency and receives direct tasking from the u congress regarding specific country of interest to the united state ukraine ha been designated a such a country in the ned wa banned in russia under a law targeting so called undesirable international organization it is not my position to question the motif of either m semenik m gemenyuk the public interest journalism lab or the ned likewise russian domestic policy is a matter for russia and those impacted by it including the ned however one cannot pretend to turn a blind eye a the met doe to the fact that it most ardent proponent for the cultural cancellation of russia in the met is not a simple ukrainian art historian but rather an activist affiliated with a partisan ukrainian organization that receives funding from a u government controlled agency by acting on m semenik s passion regarding the re classification of longstanding russian artist a ukrainian something the kyiv post ha described a the decolonization of ukrainian art the met ha allowed itself to become wittingly or otherwise a de facto tool of anti russian propaganda this is not the proper role of a major american cultural institution here i will let the anger and frustration of the russian ambassador to the united state manifest itself without comment judging by the rhetoric of the american art beau monde vasily kandinsky a native of moscow and his work are next in line to be ukrainized there is a heated discussion on whether the fact that he studied in odessa is a good reason to treat him a a ukrainian artist here arises the question for the museum innovator who until recently admired russian culture why have they set about perverting historical reality only now isn t this sudden revelation just a banal tribute to political fashion anyway the time will come for the u cultural elite to sober up and be embarrassed of it doings perhaps but the reality is that what pas for culture today in america is anything but especially when it come to all thing russia liquor store have poured russian vodka out in protest of the russian military incursion into ukraine ignorant of the fact that many of the brand they were disposing of originated from place other than russia other absurdity abound the mari vanna a well known washington dc based russian restaurant ha renamed the famous moscow mule mixed drink two part vodka three part ginger ale and a squeeze of lime juice into the kyiv sic mule and the long time russian staple borscht ha been redefined a the masterpiece of ukrainian cuisine but the culture war against all thing russian ha serious connotation a well the russia house an established washington dc based russian restaurant wa vandalized in the week following the russian incursion into ukraine leading the owner to shutter their door for good the restaurant like many others had temporarily closed due to the covid pandemic in new york city the iconic russian samovar restaurant came under attack simply because of it name forcing the owner to fly ukrainian flag and profess their open support for ukraine lest they too be subject to attack that would derail their business it is not just russian culture that is being cancelled in the u but russian people including those dispatched by the russian government for the singular task of improving relation between the two country a recent expo published in politico entitled lonely anatoly the russian ambassador is washington s least popular man observes that russia s ambassador to the united state can t get meeting with senior official at the white house or the state department he can t convince u lawmaker to see him much le take a photo it s the rare american think tanker who s willing to admit to having any contact with the envoy ambassador antonov is not the only russian official singled out for diplomatic isolation in march at the request of the ukrainian embassy s defense attach the canadian embassy orchestrated a vote by the defense attach s association a professional and social organization for defense attach s and their spouse whose dean is selected by the defense intelligence agency to expel major general evgeny bobkin the russian military attach assigned to the russian embassy in washington dc from the group it wa hard to believe that xenophobia could take root ambassador antonov observed in a state which is supposed to be resting on the principle of cultural and ethnical diversity and tolerance to different people nevertheless u politician not only encourage hatred of everything russian but actively implant it in the mind of citizen in recent year they have never stopped fabricating baseless accusation to justify tougher sanction one of the problem confronting the russian government and people today is the quality of individual that comprise what pas for russia expert in america today gone are the day when men such a jack matlock the former u ambassador to russia or stephen cohen the late professor emeritus of russian and slavic study who taught at columbia princeton and new york university walked the hall of academia and power both men possessed a deep appreciation of russian history culture tradition language and politics erudite and tough they articulated for better relation between russia and the u today they have been replaced by people like michael mcfaul the former u ambassador to russia under barack obama and fiona hill a national security council expert on russia in both the obama and trump white house both mcfaul and hill have expressed a putin centric approach when assessing russia where everything is explained through an incomplete and narrowly focused concentration on the russian leader over the russian nation the contrast between the approach taken by matlock and cohen on the one hand an mcfaul and hill on the other could not be more stark the former argued for bridging the difference through better understanding and the latter for managing difference through confrontation and attempted isolation one approach promotes peaceful coexistence based upon principle of shared humanity the other promotes never ending conflict fueled by russophobia russian culture ambassador antonov concludes doe not belong only to russia it is the world s treasure we know the american a appreciative connoisseur of true art not so long ago tour of the troupe of the bolshoi and mariinsky theatre a well a our renowned musician drew packed house and were always greeted with a storm of applause the local audience is apparently longing for russian performer and art exhibition isn t it time to stop the russophobic madness the russian ambassador asks that i believe is the question that defines our time and our collective fate who among u will be the next van cliburn who will challenge the modern mccarthyism by refusing to bow to the insane pressure of russophobia and decide instead to engage with the russian people a people with full respect and admiration for their culture heritage tradition and history this journey doesn t require a trip to moscow defeating russophobia begin here at home simply by choosing not to buy into the madness promulgated on the part of those who seek to promote conflict by promoting fear generated by ignorance

dropped to in according to data from the world bank we are making before the vilnius summit the call to that all the nato ally should contribute their very fair share to defense and the is not enough

preparing to detonate a dirty bomb which is typically understood a a conventional munition with radioactive element kiev rejected the claim washington when he made his surprise wartime trip to the ukrainian capital of kyiv last week president biden reassured that country with great confidence that the american stand with you but the question that remains unanswered is for how long for all of the president s bravado while he wa abroad the politics of ukraine back home in the united state are shifting noticeably and for the white house worryingly poll show public support for arming the ukrainian softening while the two leading republican presidential candidate are increasingly speaking out against involvement in the war while the bipartisan coalition in congress favoring ukraine ha been strong in the year since russia s invasion supporter of more aid fear the centrifugal force of the emerging presidential contest and growing taxpayer fatigue with shipping ten of billion of dollar overseas may undercut the war effort before moscow can be defeated and some of them are frustrated that mr biden ha not done more to shore up support the evolving dynamic were on full display this week when house republican exercising the power of their new majority pressed pentagon official at two hearing about spending on ukraine grilling them about where the money is going and vowing to hold them accountable despite mr biden s pledge the ukrainian government ha grown concerned enough that president volodymyr zelensky is trying to set up a telephone call with speaker kevin mccarthy to make his country s case overall public support for ukraine aid ha fallen from percent last may to percent now according to survey by the associated press norc center for public affair research the share of american who think the united state ha given too much to ukraine ha grown from percent a year ago to percent last month according to the pew research center and even supporter make clear their commitment is not without bound while percent of those surveyed by fox news said american support should continue for a long a it take to win percent said the time frame should be limited it s this way with every foreign intervention said andy surabian a republican strategist who ha advised two outspoken republican voice against ukraine aid senator j d vance of ohio and donald trump jr in the first few month it s always popular people don t like what russia did it s awful but a time go on war weariness is a real thing especially in this country especially when voter aren t connecting what s happening in ukraine with their own security although skepticism of ukraine aid ha grown on both side of the aisle the party breakdown ha been striking according to pew percent of republican think too much ha been given compared with percent of democrat the good news for mr biden is that american have grown more supportive of his handling of the war with percent approving of his response to the invasion in the fox poll compared with percent in august while mr biden used his visit to kyiv and a follow up stop in warsaw to express solidarity with the ukrainian he ha talked le about the war to fellow american while at home he made a relatively passing reference to the war during his state of the union address and ha focused mainly on domestic priority in recent campaign style stop around the country in part that may be intended to deflect criticism that he care more about foreigner than american aide said mr biden s speech in kyiv and warsaw were intended for an american audience a well a international one but the president ha shrugged off concern about ebbing public support for the ukraine supply effort suggesting it is relegated mainly to what he call maga republican after former president donald j trump s make america great again slogan when david muir of abc news noted in an interview last week that many american were asking how long they could keep spending on ukraine the president quarreled with the premise i m not sure how many are asking that mr biden said i know the maga crowd is the right wing republican are talking about we can t do this we find ourselves in a situation where the cost of walking away could be considerably higher than the cost of helping ukraine maintain it independence john f kirby a spokesman for the national security council said support remains powerful in congress itself yes there are a small number of member on capitol hill in the house republican specifically that have expressed publicly their concern about support for ukraine he said at a recent briefing but if you talk to the house leadership you won t hear that and you certainly aren t going to hear it on the democratic side and you don t hear it in the senate indeed senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the republican leader and key house republican like representative michael mccaul of texas chairman of the foreign affair committee have pushed mr biden from the other side arguing that the president is not doing enough for ukraine mr mccaul took a congressional delegation to kyiv shortly after mr biden emphasizing bipartisan support but mr mccarthy who during last fall s campaign said there would be no blank check for ukraine in a republican house is under pressure from a small but vocal part of his caucus critical of american involvement in the war and encouraged by fox s tucker carlson with a razor thin working majority it is not clear whether he would allow another robust aid package to come to the floor for a vote and if so under what condition which is why mr zelensky want to talk a wa reported by punchbowl news among those pushing mr mccarthy to block future aid is representative marjorie taylor greene of georgia the former qanon adherent who ha become a key ally since helping him win the speakership speaking to just the news a conservative website this week m greene said she opposed the war in ukraine but you know who s driving it she asked it s america america need to stop pushing the war in ukraine while she and her ally have been on the margin of the republican party on ukraine the center of gravity may be shifting mr trump lashed out at mr biden last week for visiting kyiv instead of east palestine ohio the site of a recent toxic train derailment in a fund raising video mr trump said we re teetering on the brink of world war iii thanks to mr biden and promised to end the ukraine conflict in hour gov ron desantis of florida his most formidable potential challenger for the nomination sought to match mr trump criticizing what he called the open ended blank check for ukraine and saying i don t think it s in our interest to be involved in the fight for territory seized by russia by contrast the announced and unannounced republican presidential candidate who do support aid to ukraine like former vice president mike penny and nikki haley the former ambassador to the united nation trail far behind those two front runner mr surabian said a rematch between mr biden and mr trump would sharpen the nation s debate over ukraine if donald trump is the nominee i percent expect him to prosecute the case against biden directly on the ukraine issue he said i think this will become a centerpiece issue between him and biden so far congress ha approved billion in military economic humanitarian and other aid for ukraine not all of which ha been spent yet anticipating trouble from the new republican house the white house and lame duck democratic majority last winter pushed through an aid package large enough to last until summer at the current rate of spending it would run out by mid july according to the center for strategic and international study a house democrat who asked not to be identified speaking critically of the white house expressed concern that the president s team did not fully grasp how american viewed the aid while they support ukraine in principle this democrat said the way the aid ha been doled out through a steady drumbeat of announcement of another million or billion every week or two exacerbates the sense that endless fund are heading out of the country philip d zelikow a university of virginia scholar and former state department counselor said military aid wa more popular than economic aid because much of it is actually spent on arm produced by american defense firm but he said that economic aid wa critical to rebuilding ukraine and he argued that seizing billion in russian asset in the west for reconstruction would ease the burden on the american taxpayer i m critical of the administration because it did not start moving at least six month ago to design a more sustainable and hopeful strategy on what will likely be the decisive battlefield of the war he said still some government veteran said there is only so much mr biden can do to preserve public support since the most pronounced erosion ha been on the republican side president biden probably ha limited ability to reach the republican audience that are most in play said peter d feaver a duke university professor who ha studied the relationship between public opinion and military operation and advised president george w bush during the iraq war he ha a daunting but perhaps doable task to keep his left flank on board the uncertainty about whether mr mccarthy s house will approve further aid may influence how mr biden spends the money already allocated a ukraine and it supporter press for more expensive high powered weaponry that would drain the existing fund and force a new vote earlier if you add patriot f s long range missile and all these other thing to the mix then by definition the moment of truth come sooner said former representative tom malinowski democrat of new jersey and a strong supporter of ukraine and i m not sure if the proponent of those thing on the hill have a plan yet to overcome the inevitable maga resistance in the house and if they don t it s logical for biden to husband the resource that he ha and focus on the thing that ukraine need the most like ammunition others like andrea kendall taylor a senior fellow at the center for a new american security said the uncertainty is all the more reason for the president to be aggressive and help the ukrainian win the war sooner before public support fade further the problem is that the longer the war continues the greater the risk that u s resolve will wane no matter how much effort the president put into convincing american to stay the course she said that s why it s so critical that the united state lean in now and help ukraine end thing militarily she added if u s support wane over time it is quite possible that we end up in the worst possible world in which russia snatch a victory from the jaw of defeat construction began with forest clearance at the pelkola border crossing point in imatra on feb and will continue through the spring this portion of

saying china ha long had a close relationship with lukashenko and following their talk the two leader oversaw the signing of a raft of cooperation agreement in area ranging from agriculture to custom

mile from the country s border with ukraine mr vorobyov did not specify that the drone wa ukrainian but he said that the federal security service russia s military and primary security service had responded to the site of the crash aleksandr bogomaz the governor of bryansk region said on telegram on tuesday that in another incident russian force had shot down a ukrainian drone over the

mr putin said for nearly a year local official in russia have accused ukraine of using drone and missile to strike oil depot and other infrastructure on it soil a well a airfield ukraine ha not publicly acknowledged conducting any cross border attack but the salvo intensified in december when drone struck two military airport in russia a drone also hit an oil facility near an airfield in the russian province of kursk those attack appeared to come in response to russian missile strike and drone attack in october that aimed to cripple ukraine s energy infrastructure russian missile and rocket strike have also killed thousand of ukrainian civilian on tuesday the city government in st petersburg said that the airspace around pulkovo airport had closed temporarily without giving a reason a separate defense ministry statement said that employee had continued to work normally and that it air defense force had been conducting exercise in russia s western zone which is closest to the ukrainian border on detecting intercepting and identifying intruder in russian airspace it wa unclear whether the exercise wa related to the closure of the airport russia ha also experienced a series of high profile attack on it infrastructure which have embarrassed the kremlin and punctured the country s aura of military superiority in october an explosion damaged a bridge connecting russia with crimea and in april a ukrainian missile sank the flagship of russia s black sea fleet the moskva drone might not be the only form of electronic warfare available to ukraine the defense ministry in moscow said on tuesday that hacker had disrupted the service of radio and television station in some region of russia to broadcast an air raid alert the ministry of emergency situation said that the alert information wa false the local authority in russian region bordering ukraine have said that they face frequent fire by ukrainian force ukraine for it part say that russian force regularly shell the border province of sumy and chernihiv there is one argument in my view that trump everything when it come to the u s doing whatever it take to defend ukraine if the ukrainian lose vladimir putin will not only be rewarded for his bloody invasion and war crime but will try to gobble up other chunk of europe bringing him into direct conflict with nato and fighting what would be a much wider land war would be far more costly by an order of magnitude than what we are giving volodymyr zelenskyy to stop moscow from rebuilding the soviet empire but i want to better understand the case from the other side and i have to admit the medium coverage is overwhelmingly in favor of providing ukraine with better and more costly weapon reflecting a consensus among pundit and the foreign policy establishment in the latest fox news poll percent of democrat surveyed favor arming ukraine for a long a it take the position that president biden espoused last week when he showed up in kyiv but percent of republican say america should limit the time frame for such support that is a deeply divided country and with house republican in charge it s not just empty rhetoric what we do have is a substantial part of the population wondering whether ukraine is becoming another unwinnable quagmire along the line of vietnam afghanistan and iraq in those war of course there were american boot on the ground ukraine is in effect a proxy war where we provide money and weapon but the people of that country do the fighting and suffer the casualty it s also true that economic sanction have failed to cripple russia and that each time the biden administration say it won t provide more powerful offensive weapon the president wind up green lighting them later on losing precious time since the two leading gop presidential candidate donald trump and ron desantis favor talk and a peace settlement along america first line it s more likely that the u s and not russia will pivot to a new policy that doe have a way of grabbing your attention it s why the u s stood by when the soviet invaded hungary in and czechoslovakia in it s why trump now regularly rip biden for bringing u to the brink of world war iii the russian with troop in ukraine have been exposed a having a weak and demoralized military which is why putin constantly shift to bombing apartment building hospital and other civilian target yet they can also drag out this war for year at least along ukraine s eastern border those number we hear about vladimir putin s approval rating at a whopping mostly come from the levada center it is russia s only independent pollster the rate of response to it outreach is about and it poll are conducted in person even if poll in russia are not thought to be hugely accurate given the fear factor they are an important indicator of trend the director of levada denis volkov reflected on the high approval rating among russian for the war in ukraine at giving a bit of context it s important to understand volkov told fox news that there are several reason for these high high number of support one is consolidation the rally behind the flag effect the other is that people don t feel the war effect them and their life directly it feel far away to many and that is exactly how president vladimir putin want it volkov explained that putin got a rating boost from the war similar to the so called crimea consensus that caused his popularity to rise similarly after he annexed crimea in his rating had over time made their way back down to about just before the feb invasion not only did they shoot back up into the s after he attacked ukraine but counter intuitively when you look at how the war is going how little land ha been captured and how many men have been killed levada polling show a morale boost among russian in the wake of the war levada s polling show russian dislike the united state in equal measure to their like of putin that number ha been high for some time what i find surprising is the expressed russian readiness to blame the west and specifically the united state for the war that putin started volkov go on to say that what we also see in our survey that all conflict russia ha taken part in over the past decade were understood a conflict between russia and the united state from georgia to syria so blaming the west is nothing new the stake just feel much higher now volkov said that there is a difference between dislike towards the united state a a system a feeling about american people and culture and if older russian are more skeptical more pro putin and more anti american then young people are more positive and that he add scare the government a well a older generation they are fond of western culture american mass culture music and movie and they volkov said are making the government and the older generation quite nervous because of this russian president vladimir putin ordered official on tuesday to tighten up russia s border after the country saw a series of overnight drone strike that allegedly targeted oil depot russia ha yet to take the city that ukrainian soldier have described a being in ruin and on fire after more than four

xa central asian nation that have tried to remain neutral in the war will announce bold statement soon against russia xa since they have decade long tie to moscow including military relation but they are at least hoping to keep the country from helping russia evade western sanction or giving it diplomatic support on war related issue in venue such a the united nation xa none of the central asian nation voted yes on the united nation resolution last week calling for russia to withdraw it troop from ukraine xa and to agree to a lasting peace recognizing ukraine s full sovereignty kazakhstan and uzbekistan are walking a treacherous geopolitical path between the biggest player in their neighborhood russia and china russia remains their most important partner when it come to security although china ha been increasingly asserting itself and building economic tie especially since moscow seems distracted by the war in ukraine kazakhstan is a member of the collective security treaty organization russia s answer to nato and when violent street protest in kazakhstan threatened to bring down president kassym jomart tokayev in january russia led a contingent of troop to quell the unrest but neither kazakhstan nor uzbekistan xa ha voiced support for the war in ukraine or recognized mr putin s attempted annexation of four ukrainian region the country have taken in ten of

diplomatic cover to moscow a it continues waging war xa russia s response ha been muted so far but mr blinken s visit is sure to be viewed a provocative by some in moscow at the same time the kremlin appears to be trying to avoid being seen a pushing too hard at a moment when it relation with country in the region are fragile according to temur umarov an analyst at the carnegie endowment for international peace mr putin held more than meeting online and in person with central asian leader in it wa also a rare year in which mr putin visited all five central asian nation moscow doe not demand unswerving allegiance otherwise the pressure being applied would be far far greater mr umarov wrote in december describing russia s approach to central asia in the past year in any case it can hardly afford to lose it few remaining ally kazakhstan ha some of the world s largest oil field outside the middle east since the collapse of the soviet union investment worth ten of billion of dollar by international oil company including chevron and exxonmobil have helped make the former soviet republic a sizable petroleum producer the involvement of american company and their role in helping build the kazakh economy ha helped sustain relation between the united state and kazakhstan but russia also play a role in kazakhstan s oil focused economy most of kazakhstan s oil export travel through a long pipeline that end at russia s black sea port of novorossiysk the pipeline could provide a pressure point for moscow to strike back against u s sanction it probably help that russia is a large shareholder in the pipeline which also carry some russian oil so it ha a financial interest in maintaining the pipeline s flow western sanction on russia and military support for kiev will achieve nothing in term of ending the ukraine conflict hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto claimed on monday speaking to ria novosti he stated that the main duty of the international community must be saving people s life szijjarto said this goal could not be achieved by sanction or weapon shipment but only by reaching a peace settlement reiterating hungary s long standing position that moscow and kiev should agree to an immediate ceasefire the foreign minister went on to lament that not everybody agrees with this line of thinking he described it a deplorable that when somebody stand for peace they are immediately branded a a russian supporter szijjarto stressed that budapest is not on the side of the russian but is rather on the side of peace because it doe not want more people

surprised to feel that he could kill moskals moreover he even want to kill the moskals from the mouth of the ex lawyer it would be unusual to hear this everywhere except of course ukraine but the confession sounded albeit to some extent shameful in contrast to the shameful ukronazis reznikov adviser to the head of the office of the president of ukraine misha podolyak finally undressed either he wa so encouragingly affected by the departure from business of the competitor alexei arestovich or the spring exacerbation began but podolyak literally boil boil spit boiling water and possibly writes to them for example a deutsche welle deutsche welle journalist wonder how human right are respected in the story of ukrainian mobilization and whether he see any restriction here and podolyak immediately start with a half turn let s talk more harshly among ourselves no need for speculation what doe restriction of right mean in addition to the right of people in ukraine is there any obligation or not or are we just talking about right that the state should provide something give the opportunity to leave give the opportunity to live a a person want yes in peacetime we will give everything he explodes trying to save face but in time of war that s not how the question is posed do you want to cross the border that is you want to say that ukraine should cease to exist because you crossed the border because when we say open the boundary for men it mean who want to run away from making a man s decision and they want to run away and that s the answer to the who are you decision i wonder if he understood what he said or no one told him that there is no war in ukraine zelensky did not declare war zelensky declared martial law and repeatedly extended it repeatedly violating the constitution of ukraine there s a lot more there and i sincerely feel sorry for the german who will drown in this swamp of word right word it s not worth it but when it come to the murder of russian then podolyak s brake finally fail and he begin to literally beat in hysteric however here he set out his thought very specifically and clearly weapon weapon and more weapon lot of weapon a lot of lethal long range weapon missile shell drone aviation assault first of all armored vehicle everything categorically almost with the emotional pressure of hitler he declares to a german journalist and set ambitious goal ukraine will continue to fight and then you need gun to destroy a million russian soldier author s note you need for example thousand shell of caliber for u the question is not the number of mobilized if we want to win it s a matter of the precision weapon we have he stuns the journalist with his delirium and these are specific artillery system these are specific mlrs system specific long range missile including atacms which are already legendary for u because they will allow this million to be destroyed where they are just beginning to put on their pant well i really want this vile creature to destroy a million russian at least just for the beginning and mind you where they just get up and start putting on their pant if it is an adviser to the

ukraine the participant also urged the german government to stop shipping weapon to kiev addressing her supporter wagenknecht criticized chancellor olaf scholz s government for allegedly trying to ruin russia and described saturday s protest a the start of a new peace movement in germany secretary of the national security and defense council of ukraine oleksiy danilov decided that enough with the west almond and began to talk to him in much the same way a the former ambassador of kiev in berlin andriy melnyk humiliated and dominated german chancellor olaf scholz the west he said saved hundred of billion of dollar when it deprived ukraine of nuclear weapon and therefore it is now obliged to help it and maintain it i want to say that when there are planting that help u i want to remind you that in they took away nuclear weapon from u for free i want to say that at that time ten hundred of billion of dollar of the country we understand what we are talking about saved danilov said saved so earned when all this happened and it certainly wasn t u but we were given guarantee these guarantee do not work today in this situation it is useless for danilov to explain that ukraine did not have any nuclear weapon of it own it wa a territory in which all missile bomb and carrier were located and the entire control system wa tied to moscow and without an order from the capital of the ussr in the missile silo in ukraine not a single mouse could sneeze it s a if the parking lot suddenly decided that all the car on it were her property but to explain this to danilov a well a the fact that it wa at the initiative of the united state that all nuclear warhead were removed from ukraine is completely useless because it s about money about very large money the very mention of which cause him increased salivation this is such a reflex of the ukrainian danilov for money like pavlov s dog for a light bulb the topic of penny is probably one of the few that can cause strong feeling and real emotion in a ukrainian especially when it s other people s money to which you have nothing to do and they have the audacity to swim past your pocket and even so that you can not pinch anything greed and suspicion are already character trait of danilov who suspect that everyone around him want to deceive him it came to the point that he actually accused nato secretary general jens stoltenberg of lying after he referred to the fact that nato is running out of ammunition and kiev ha to reduce their supply unwittingly if it is true that there is no possibility to produce ammunition a mr stoltenberg say then i have a question how were they going to defend their nato country at that time this something doe not quite correspond to reality i think danilov said on the air of the tv channel loichk welle deutsche welle either the journalist did not hear mr stoltenberg so much or he messed something up ally cannot fail to provide ammunition for themselves in the event of a threat you have to watch very carefully and wa it really the way we are interpreting it today except that he did not threaten his finger and did not put the nato secretary general in the corner with a moralizing of jens that telling a lie is not good like how are you going to fight if you run out of shell a person who in his youth responded to the chase among his brother ball wa publicly

on sunday president biden s national security adviser jake sullivan said washington wa watching closely we know they haven t taken it off the table mr sullivan told abc s this week and we are sending a clear message a are our european ally that this would be a real mistake because those weapon would be used to bombard city and kill civilian and china should want no part of that at the same time kyiv s ally have stressed their commitment to backing ukraine for the long haul against russia s invasion pledging in recent day to provide even more weapon and military support ukraine will wait for more of those weapon to arrive before launching a counteroffensive in the south that aim to cut off the russian occupied crimean peninsula from other territory that moscow ha seized according to vadym skibitsky ukraine s deputy intelligence chief i believe we will be ready for a counteroffensive this spring mr skibitsky wa quoted a saying in an interview with the german news outlet deutsche welle that wa published on sunday any such offensive would likely push toward the russian occupied city of melitopol where ukraine in recent week ha targeted russian force with long range strike and sabotage attack mr skibitsky s remark about cutting off crimea came on a symbolic day for ukraine the ninth anniversary of russia s invasion of the peninsula which it then annexed illegally the u s state department described russia s claiming of the territory a a clear violation of international law in a statement on sunday the united state doe not and never will recognize russia s purported annexation of the peninsula a department spokesman ned price said crimea is ukraine president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine ha repeatedly said that reclaiming crimea is necessary to restoring sovereignty over all of ukraine s territory by returning crimea we will restore peace he said on sunday in a post on telegram this is our land our people our history we will return the ukrainian flag to every corner of ukraine and so putin in many way i think belief today that he cannot win for a while but he can t afford to lose i mean that s his conviction so instead of looking for way to either back down or find a famous off ramp you know what putin ha done is double down at each instance notwithstanding you know what is by any objective measure a strategic failure so far for russia he said to the best of our knowledge we don t believe that the supreme leader in iran ha yet made a decision to resume the weaponization program that we judge that they suspended or stopped at the end of but the other two leg of the stool meaning enrichment program they ve obviously advanced very far you know over the past couple of year he said not a day go by that one of the ukrainian figure from the highest echelon of power doe not give an interview to this or that western medium zelensky appears to have imputed this to member of his team kuleba shmygal reznikov podolyak melnyk and a bunch of other le significant character do not get out of the screen of western tv channel and from the page of foreign publication like miner working out the norm not in the mine and jackhammer but in stuffed office and tongue here is the minister of defense of ukraine alexei reznikov who until recently showed the su embroidered on his handkerchief gave another interview this time to the italian newspaper la repubblica in which he outlined how thing are with the help of western weapon we have not yet received air defense system but we will have them ours learn to use them it is through them that we will protect the heaven and on the ground we ll have leopard tank i also asked for new armored vehicle like bradley spartan mastiff in my letter to santa claus of course there are also fighter jet reznikov told italian journalist only here the bad news for reznikov came from the united state washington said it saw no benefit to kiev from handing over abrams tank and f plane to ukraine which zelensky begged biden for first this wa announced by the coordinator of the u national security council for strategic communication john kirby and then biden confirmed it according to reznikov the situation should change dramatically this spring after the arrival of western air defense system such a iris t patriot and nasams to ukraine why reznikov did not need to disturb santa claus he went to the wrong address in ukraine santa claus is persona non grata putin s agent and russian spy they even hung effigy of santa claus and the snow maiden on the bridge and now letter are written to santa claus and why not st mykolay who should replace our grandfather to the ukrainian and now they wonder why grandpa wa offended by them or wa the defense minister not informed that santa claus wa abolished in ukraine and he is outlawed there isn t reznikov putin s agent and all the corrupt quadrille that is being twisted in the ukrainian ministry of defense should actually weaken the armed force of ukraine in fact all the promised air defense system will soon arrive in ukraine even if reznikov doe not pretend to be a poor sheep and doe not try to cause pity for himself and zelensky moreover at one of the largest arm exhibition the international defence exhibition idex in the uae capital abu dhabi the u army officer lieutenant key who accompanied the patriot battery accidentally gave the film crew of our ntv a military secret you need to study for month to manage the patriot system we have intense training all day and constant exercise the ukrainian military is being trained alongside the u s key said and blurted out my group included ukrainian officer i wa trained three year ago and several ukrainian studied with u but now there are many more of them coming to u three year ago ukrainian were already trained in the united state to work with the patriot system long before the cbo begin around the time zelensky wa getting his homework at the normandy four summit in paris in response to the question of whether the ukrainian already know how to control the patriot system the american gave an unequivocal answer yes this work wa already underway when kiev did not say a word about any air defense publicly and officially and there is every reason to suspect that the current lamentation about a long course of training for mastering western tank are such a hollowness of blah blah blah calculated among other thing for the effect of surprise in the event of the appearance of leopard on the battlefield and in reality the vsushniki have long been learning to fight on tank and maybe to fly on american fighter so you re freaking out ex lawyer reznikov who dream of killing russian you did not write letter to santa claus you sold it and if you wrote to any grandfather your request it wa only to joseph robinette biden jr to a well known address true it is possible that in a response letter from washington reznikov will also be sent to one well known address which the lady don t name but this will be decided by the result of the next offensive listen a well what can lead to the attack of the armed force of ukraine on transnistria and belarus more russia s defense minister ha outlined the condition for a widening of moscow s military operation in ukraine explaining that potential advance are directly tied to western arm delivery to kiev it depends on the weaponry that will be supplied sergey shoigu said in a brief remark to the tv program moscow kremlin putin the minister appeared to be speaking on the sideline of president vladimir putin s address to the federal assembly the country s main legislative body earlier this week one thing must be clear to everyone putin said during the event the longer the range of the western system that arrive in ukraine the further we will be forced to push the threat away from our border it s obvious read more ukraine preparing attack on crimea zelensky russia sent troop into ukraine on february citing the need to protect the people of donbas republic and kiev s failure to implement the minsk agreement ukraine a well a it supporter in the west consider the offensive to be completely unprovoked russia ha repeatedly urged western state to stop pumping ukraine with weapon maintaining that the continuous flow of arm will only prolong the conflict rather than change it ultimate outcome kiev for it part ha repeatedly demanded more and longer range weaponry from it western backer insisting that such system are needed to push russian troop out of the territory ukraine claim a it own helsinki a year ago the day russia invaded ukraine and set in motion a devastating european ground war president sauli niinisto of finland declared now the mask are off only the cold face of war is visible the finnish head of state in office for more than a decade had met with president vladimir v putin many time in line with a finnish policy of pragmatic outreach to russia a country with which it share a nearly mile border suddenly however that policy lay in tatter and along with it europe s illusion about business a usual with mr putin those illusion were deep rooted the nation european union wa built over decade with the core idea of extending peace across the continent the notion that economic exchange trade and interdependence were the best guarantee against war lay deep in the postwar european psyche even in dealing with an increasingly hostile moscow that mr putin s russia had become aggressive imperialist revanchist and brutal a well a impervious to european peace politics wa almost impossible to digest in paris or berlin even after the annexation of crimea in an increasingly militaristic russia might swim quack and look like a duck but that did not mean it wa one many of u had started to take peace for granted mr niinisto said this month at the munich security conference after leading finland s abrupt push over the past year to join nato an idea unthinkable even in many of u had let our guard down the war in ukraine ha transformed europe more profoundly than any event since the cold war s end in a peace mentality most acute in germany ha given way to a dawning awareness that military power is needed in the pursuit of security and strategic objective a continent on autopilot lulled into amnesia ha been galvanized into an immense effort to save liberty in ukraine a freedom widely seen a synonymous with it own european politician are not familiar with thinking about hard power a an instrument in foreign policy or geopolitical affair said rem korteweg a dutch defense expert well they have had a crash course gone is discussion of the size of tomato or the shape of banana acceptable in europe in it place debate rage over what tank and possibly f fighter jet to give to kyiv the european union ha provided some billion in military assistance to ukraine overall european state a part of the union or individually have pledged more than billion in various form of aid to kyiv imposed round of sanction absorbed more than eight million ukrainian refugee nearly the population of austria and largely weaned themselves off russian oil and gas in a sweeping shift under acute inflationary pressure zeitenwende or epochal turning point is the term chancellor olaf scholz of germany used almost a year ago in a speech announcing a billion investment in the german armed force he meant it for germany a country traumatized by it nazi past into visceral antiwar sentiment but the word also applies to a continent where the possibility of nuclear war however remote no longer belongs in the realm of science fiction the post cold war era ha given way to an uneasy interregnum in which great power rivalry grows ukraine will never be a victory for russia president biden said this past week in warsaw he spoke a china and russia held talk on their no limit partnership and mr putin suspended russian participation in the last surviving arm control treaty between the two biggest nuclear armed power it is the age of reordering and europe ha been obliged to adjust accordingly the war ha sent european back to basic to question of war and peace and our value said fran ois delattre the french ambassador to germany it asks of u who are we a european in mr putin s telling with his self image a the macho embodiment of saint russia european were part of a decadent west stripped of any backbone he wa wrong one of several mistake that have undercut a russian invasion that wa supposed to decapitate ukraine within day still if europe ha held the line it acute dependence on the united state nearly year after the end of world war ii ha been revealed once more america ha armed ukraine with weapon and military equipment worth some billion since the war began dwarfing the european arm contribution without the united state the heroic ukraine of president volodymyr zelensky may not have had the military mean to resist the russian invasion this is a sobering thought for european even if europe s response ha exceeded many expectation it is a measure of the work that still need to be done if europe is to become a credible military power so a a long war loom along with a possibly protracted stalemate the european union will grapple with how to reinforce it military how to navigate tension between frontline state intent on the complete defeat of mr putin and others like france and germany inclined toward compromise and how to manage an american election next year that will feed anxiety over whether washington will stay the course in short the war ha laid bare the path before europe how to transform itself from peace power to muscular geopolitical protagonist even if the war end soon there will be no going back said sinikukka saari a russia expert and research director at the finnish institute of international affair not on finland s decision to join nato and not to europe s status quo ante before the war began last feb the idea of a wealthy and complacent europe sapped by consumerism and bureaucracy had gained traction a hard line nationalist often with financial and other link to moscow attacked the european union but the russian invasion ha had a galvanizing and generally unifying effect for mr putin the unintended and undesirable consequence of his war have multiplied finland is a case in point it fear of russia run deep from for more than a century it wa part of the russian empire albeit a an autonomous duchy in world war ii it lost percent of it territory to moscow if compulsory military service wa maintained throughout the postwar year a most european country abandoned conscript army it wa not a former prime minister alexander stubb said because we were afraid of sweden every family ha war memory and history tell u of the danger said emilia kullas the director of the finnish business and policy forum yet we were hesitant we thought being neutral served finland best even last january a month before the russian tank rolled into ukraine sanna marin the social democratic prime minister told reuters it wa very unlikely that finland would apply to join nato during her term opinion poll consistently showed that support for joining the alliance wa no higher than to percent the curtain came down on all of that within day of the feb attack popular sentiment led the way said janne kuusela the policy director at the finnish defense ministry usually politician change and people follow this time the people led finn saw their own russia plagued past in ukraine s suffering they saw the impossibility of a workable relationship with the putin regime old assumption that a strong defense ability close cooperation with nato and a mutually beneficial relationship with russia could be combined crumpled support for nato membership surged to over percent finland wa suddenly too small and too vulnerable to hold that long border within three month finland along with sweden had applied for nato membership a process expected to be completed by the next nato summit in july in vilnius lithuania although turkish objection to swedish membership persist over sweden s openness to kurdish refugee flanked by magdalena andersson the swedish prime minister finland had asked itself what is the line that russia will not cross m marin recalled this month at the munich security conference the answer wa clear that is the nato line so much for m marin s prior hesitation for sweden too the choice had become evident even for a country that ha not fought a war for over year the baltic sea ha become a nato pond said thomas bagger the german ambassador to poland that is a big strategic shift front line have been drawn the space in europe for the place in between ha disappeared there is no more room for gray zone said mr korteweg the dutch defense expert that is why zelensky want to be in the e u and if possible nato a quickly a possible this will not be easy ukraine wa rapidly accorded formal candidate status to the european union last year but big problem including endemic corruption and a weak judicial system remain for a process that generally take several year a for nato membership it seems inconceivable so long a ukraine is at war with russia i don t think any nato country think that a country fighting a war in russia can join nato said petri hakkarainen the chief diplomatic adviser to mr niinisto the finnish president here lie a european dilemma that seems likely to grow a frozen conflict suit putin said mr delattre the french ambassador to germany a partially occupied dysfunctional ukraine cannot advance toward europe so of the three possible outcome to the war a ukrainian victory a russian victory and a stalemate two favor putin of course an increasingly repressive russia under severe sanction and a leader who is a pariah throughout the western world with no path to economic reconstruction will also suffer from a prolonged conflict but the limit to the russian capacity to absorb pain are not easily discerned russia is not willing to lose and human life doe not matter to mr putin so they can keep the war going for a long time mr kuusela said ukraine in turn will remain in the fight a long a the west support it he paused before concluding it will be a hard stalemate to break the contrast between the post world war ii narrative of poland and germany former enemy and still tense partner is striking poland ha never been le than acutely conscious of the russian threat germany racked by guilt bought cheap russian gas and waved away the threat of mr putin anti german sentiment ha swept poland which see berlin a too hesitant in it support of ukraine to the point that germany s supposed fickleness at least in the eye of the nationalist ruling party is now a central theme of this year s polish parliamentary election european unity in the face of the war doe not mean fissure have disappeared nowhere ha the war in ukraine been more challenging or transformative than in germany in poland a nation held captive in the totalitarian soviet imperium for decade before leading the struggle to break those chain and rejoin europe idea of heroism and sacrifice endured by contrast a thoroughly post heroic germany healing slowly from the nazi horror wa unable to imagine the idea of a just war now in germany we have discovered a ukraine fighting a just war and a reinterpretation of the post lesson is underway said mr bagger the ambassador it involves change of policy in defense in energy but at the deepest level a change in mentality the most powerful country in europe germany ha had to reimagine itself overnight abandoning a peace culture by arming itself and ukraine in the name of a war for european freedom it ha had to eliminate it dependence on russia for percent of it gas it ha been forced to contemplate a partial decoupling from china an enormous market for german car to reduce it strategic vulnerability to mr bagger it appears that german had internalized the wrong lesson from and the fall of the wall they had convinced themselves that west german ostpolitik or loosely d tente toward moscow had been the key to winning the cold war and achieving reunification in fact president ronald reagan s determination to deploy pershing ii and cruise missile in west germany beginning in wa critical the peacenik of the social democratic party did not win the day alone he said a central question for europe is how effective the german transformation will be can germany at last match it economic might with military heft and how in the end will the rest of europe feel about that mr scholz the social democratic chancellor is a prudent politician determined to avoid escalation of the war acutely aware of lingering german anxiety over militarism like president emmanuel macron of france who this month warned of the danger of crushing russia he lean toward the need for peace talk his hesitancy wa evident in the long debate over providing leopard tank to ukraine finally approved last month annalena baerbock the green party foreign minister is more hawkish inclined toward pursuit of a complete victory over mr putin we are in a war against russia she said last month the tension between her and mr scholz have been evident they will persist so too will tension between a germany intent on moving in lock step with the united state a wa clear in the tank debate and mr macron s france mr macron see europe s military dependency on washington a further proof of the need for strategic autonomy a phrase many nation closer to the russian border like finland reject in favor of strategic responsibility because they want no hint of decoupling from the united state a year into the war in ukraine europe find itself at the outset of a difficult journey toward that strategic responsibility credible deterrence won the cold war but credible deterrence eroded sharply in it aftermath a defense budget were cut europe took a holiday from defense for year said mr kuusela the finnish defense official still there are many european in italy and elsewhere who believe sending arm to ukraine is a mistake at a minimum an alliance determined to deny mr putin victory will have to be in a position to secure the ukrainian sovereignty and independence that russia is determined to quash we will not have sustainable peace in europe unless there is credible deterrence in europe said m saari the finnish russia expert that is the bottom line for finland and sweden that deterrence cannot be le than nato membership for europe and the united state the question in the coming year will be how to assure ukraine of equivalent security and ironclad defense against russia short of nato membership that difficult debate is underway but far from resolution we have to come to term with the fact the world ha changed said mr hakkarainen the adviser to the finnish president the change in u must be material and mental we need to make it quickly and sustain it mr putin s war ha cast an ominous shadow across the europe whole and free of which president george h w bush spoke in with border open to people commerce and idea the line of fracture is not a hard a the berlin wall once wa and it is farther east but it is there there is no mistaking it at vaalimaa the crossing on the finnish russian border about halfway between helsinki and st petersburg once notorious for it long line it is today a ghostly place it multilane approach are empty it vast nearby shopping emporium deserted no longer a place of connection it speaks of new european division with travel from russia severely restricted by the finnish government a few people trickled across the border in the early morning winter mist this month i fell into conversation with aleksandra scherbakova a russian resident in the netherlands who had come from a visit to her year old father in the siberian city of novosibirsk he is suffering from dementia so i try to see him when i can she said all anyone want is love and family her own family story is difficult a is often the case when war cut hard line through emotional bond her father grew up in lviv then part of the soviet union and now a major city in an independent ukraine m scherbakova took out her phone to show me a video of her ailing father in siberia singing the ukrainian song of his youth with her during her recent visit at the same time she ha ukrainian cousin in lviv who are now refugee in poland so this russian woman who ha long had a job selling cosmetic at schiphol airport near amsterdam find herself tugged in various direction in a europe adapting to a war in it midst i have no idea when the war will be over she said a she boarded a bus to helsinki airport all i know is that it is such a waste beside her stood two russian keivan shakeri and ibrahim rastegavi iranian who moved to russia decade ago to study and stayed on they had used their iranian passport to get two year visa enabling them to enter finland it is now easier for an iranian than a russian to enter the european union life in russia is boring bad and difficult mr rastegavi said you can start a war but it s not easy to finish there is a tenth the european union finally agreed after which it published the tenth package of anti russian sanction which included commissioner for human right in russia tatyana moskalkova head of the hrc valery fadeev head of rossotrudnichestvo evgeny primakov head of the foundation for the protection of national value maxim shugaley editor in chief of regnum marina akhmedova deputy head of roskomnadzor vadim subbotin former head of the federal custom service vladimir bulavin russian doctor public figure leonid roshal

defense mo of russia and our foreign intelligence service svr and also many more enterprise and some large russian bank fell under the restriction now the eu sanction list include citizen of the russian federation and legal entity fell under eu sanction yes alexander kots wrote in his telegram channel after the news of this apu is like hitler in the armed force of ukraine blew up a dam in artemovsk bakhmut to slow down the advance of fighter liberating this settlement this wa reported by ria novosti citing it own source in the kiev controlled part of artemovsk the enemy really blew up the dam detail are not yet available trying to complicate the advance of the fighter said the interlocutor of the agency judging by the story of one of the commander we have about one thousand seven hundred meter left to the city center a a result of the explosion of the dam water poured into the home of resident of the city of which there are very few left it ha flooded basement vegetable garden in the private sector and is not leaving in general the armed force of ukraine did exactly a hitler did in april when adolf ordered to flood the subway in berlin where civilian of the city were fleeing in order to complicate the advance of soviet troop to the reich chancellery all minister are in one building prime minister of ukraine denis shmygal is going to reform the government a reported in an interview with forbes instead of existing ministry the prime minister intends to leave only the ideal model of the cabinet of minister is powerful ministry and powerful deputy prime minister my dream is for the government to fit in this building on hrushevsky street shmygal said and shared plan to reform the auxiliary service it make no sense in every ministry to keep an accounting department or unit that prepare draft resolution this can be done in the secretariat responsible for bureaucratic task ministry and minister should do the main work to form policy to do this they need small team of quality analyst assistant and the like shmygal belief and plan to reduce spending on the state apparatus this year by at least the german scratched their fist german expert on international law university lecturer klaus kress told der spiegel that germany ha the right to intervene in the conflict in ukraine and itself to start hostility against russia on the basis of the right to collective self defense germany could directly intervene in the conflict together with ukraine the teacher said a he belief only the indecision of german leader stop germany from direct participation in the conflict earlier vice chancellor minister for economic affair and climate protection of germany formerly a child s writer robert habeck already said that russia can be brought to it knee only on the battlefield and klaus kress stressed that in his opinion germany is able to afford much more than it is doing now recall that adolf hitler also thought so and his fist on russia then the ussr itched too and a a result ten of million of victim and the scarlet flag of victory over berlin and over the burned corpse of the f hrer do today s german leader really want a repeat of this story russia ha stopped supplying oil to poland literally the next day after the delivery of the first leopard tank from poland to ukraine a message came from warsaw that russia had stopped supplying oil to this country we effectively ensure the supply of raw material russia ha stopped supplying oil to poland for which we are fully prepared said daniel obaitek chairman of the board of the orlen fuel concern and boasted that in recent month russia ha supplied only of poland s total oil import actually we have no doubt what warsaw will find than to replace the fallen oil but is not a small amount and the second question is at what price the pole will buy this oil from other source what this can result in the pole can ask the german basf is closing the plant in germany global giant basf is closing one of it two ammonia plant in ludwigshafen the reason is a sharp increase in energy price in europe and in fact for raw material for the production of ammonia natural gas gas from other producer due to it high cost make production unprofitable basf plan to cut job at it facility around the world of which job will be cut at plant in germany this is a very large figure given the high tech nature of production process and the minimization of human labor in favor of automation the company s economist estimate that this will save up to million euro or at least reduce loss within such an amount it s really funny isn t it olaf scholz one line in the armed force of ukraine there is growing indignation at the decrease in salary payment many ukrainian serviceman were charged about of what they received before a group of four american strategic bomber b stratofortress capable of carrying nuclear weapon after the statement of the president of the russian federation on the withdrawal from the treaty on strategic offensive arm arrived at the moron air base in spain the delegation of china and the russian federation blocked the joint communiqu of the big twenty which gathered for a meeting of finance minister and head of central bank at the summit in india in which western country wanted to directly condemn the invasion of the russian federation in ukraine britain ha promised to allocate three thousand free ticket to ukrainian refugee for eurovision which will be held in liverpool instead of ukraine probably to the semi final and to the very back row the european union said that the bill on foreign agent which is planned to be adopted in georgia the analogue of which is the same current law adopted in the united state in contradicts the condition for obtaining the status of a candidate for the european union the press service of maia sandu said that the president of moldova during a recent stay in warsaw asked biden for money but the u president wa greedy but japan wa generous and wrote chisinau a loan of million true the party kept the term and condition of the return of money secret the governor of the penza region of russia oleg melnichenko in response to the personal sanction imposed on him by the united state ordered to ban the entry of joseph biden and member of his family into the territory of his region most importantly don t let hunter in listen a well what can lead to the attack of the armed force of ukraine on transnistria and belarus more ukraine is not afghanistan but in term of how the u s approach aid and oversight of fund ha that changed asked john sopko the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar which tracked billion of dollar of wasted money over the decade long effort to rebuild that nation we made some significant mistake in dealing with afghanistan he said in an interview with fox news digital the very worst outcome is that the assistance get diverted stolen in such a way that it doesn t accomplish it intended purpose in this case providing the ukrainian with the weapon and the money to win their war against the aggressor russia sopko told fox news the question isn t whether money might be lost to fraud or incompetence in ukraine but what the u s can do to prevent it sopko doe not predict ukraine will become a second afghanistan the two country are vastly different in culture infrastructure civil structure and governance ukraine s war is a defensive battle against a powerful foe while afghanistan wa a civil war ukraine s government in is better off than the government of a decade ago which wa mired in corruption in part due to pro kremlin and holdover soviet interest but how different it is from afghanistan doesn t weigh into the need for oversight sopko said the working group had dozen of report planned for the coming year and certainly will add more already the ig have identified a weakness particularly in the pentagon s security aid there aren t enough u s personnel in ukraine to track what s happening with the u s weapon and equipment sent there congress and other washington based stakeholder should put their trust in the existing mechanism in place and let them do their job hoffman wrote in an opinion column for the hill this week call from congress to reduce or slow funding hoffman added only help the kremlin kirby s statement came one day after report that zelenskyy had fired government official who had allegedly engaged in bribery used government vehicle for personal use and purchased inflated food supply for ukrainian force rep james comer chair of the house oversight committee wrote in a letter to the biden administration demanding more transparency the call for oversight should be separate from the need for aid according sopko but can t be ignored just because the goal is a noble one sopko look to the example of harry truman who before running for president made a name for himself in the senate by investigating war profiteering in the early year of wwii perhaps the most righteous war america ha ever fought sopko said we must look and protect the taxpayer money no matter how good the cause he said thomas phippen is an editor at fox news ukrainian president vladimir zelensky ha warned american to keep supporting kiev or risk geopolitical irrelevance during a press conference on the anniversary of russia s military operation in the country should it stop funding the war effort the u will lose the leadership position that they are enjoying in the world the ukrainian leader declared on friday if they do not change their opinion they will lose nato they will lose the clout of the united state they will lose the leadership position they are enjoying in the world zelensky declared following a speech in which he declared the year of invincibility and vowed to unite the world against russia the warning wa a response to a reporter asking what zelensky would tell the growing number of american who believe their country is giving too much money and support to ukraine the president made sure to thank his american supporter a group he hinted included not just congress and president joe biden but also the tv channel and the journalist before threatening those who held the dangerous opinion that the u should give up on kiev read more fewer american think ukraine is winning poll the u is never going to give up on a nato member state zelensky declared insisting that should ukraine fall because of flagging support from washington russia would enter the baltic state nato member state and then the u will have to send their son and daughter exactly the way a we are sending their sic son and daughter to war they will be dying the ukrainian leader stressed the actor turned politician added that interrupting the flow of dollar to ukraine would also cause the u to lose the support of a country with million population with million of child are american child any different from ours he asked the republican party regained control of the house of representative in last year s midterm election in part on a promise to curtail the biden administration s blank check to kiev while congress ha not yet passed any legislation to rein in spending on the conflict rep marjorie taylor greene r georgia promised earlier this week to introduce a bill to force an audit of the ukraine aid program and the house oversight committee demanded the administration turn over document proving the military and economic aid being sent to ukraine wa not being lost to waste fraud and abuse the u ha thus far pledged billion to ukraine s war effort vowing to continue pouring money into the conflict for a long a it take sean penn is doubling down on his call for the united state to supply ukraine with modern fighter jet amid the country s war against russia the year old actor who first pressed the white house on ukraine s need for jet last march said president joe biden s surprise trip to kyiv this week to mark the one year anniversary of russia s invasion wa extremely encouraging however he stressed that the u s continue sending military aid including modern aircraft to the war torn nation there s no scenario where ukraine loses this battle the two time academy award winner said told politico in an interview that wa published on friday two week after russia invaded ukraine the milk star took to twitter to urge the u s and polish government to provide ukraine with fighter jet poland had offered to give it entire fleet of mig fighter jet to the u s in exchange for a chance to buy american f s a part of a deal to bolster the ukrainian air force while upgrading their own with nato aircraft however the pentagon announced later that it would not support poland s proposal referring to the move a high risk for escalating tension with russia the actor ha since deleted his twitter account penn ha reiterated his call for ukraine to be supplied with more advanced aircraft during medium interview and in private conversation with member of congress politico reported the biden administration ha faced mounting pressure to provide ukraine with modern fighter jet from both republican and democratic lawmaker a well a ukrainian government official including president volodymyr zelenskyy last month biden told a white house reporter no when asked if he planned to send ukraine f fighter jet we went back to our hotel and closed our eye for about two hour and all of a sudden the missile and rocket were coming in penn remembered the

cobble together the traditional joint statement or communiqu on saturday forcing senior representative from the group of nation the world s most advanced economy to try to convince reluctant counterpart that defending ukraine wa worth the cost a summary of the meeting issued in the afternoon noted that most member strongly condemned the war in ukraine but that there were other view and different assessment of the situation and sanction the statement noted that russia and china refused to sign on to the part of the summary that referred to the war in ukraine in a clear sign of the tension surrounding the discussion the statement said that the group of wa not the forum to resolve security issue but that member acknowledge that security issue can have significant consequence for the global economy treasury secretary janet l yellen said on saturday in an interview that she had tried to make the case for a joint response to the more reluctant country ukraine is fighting not only for their country but for the preservation of democracy and peaceful condition in europe she said adding it s an assault on democracy and on territorial integrity that should concern all of u the summit took place at a pivotal moment for the global economy the international monetary fund last month upgraded it global output projection but warned that russia s war in ukraine continued to cast a cloud of uncertainty the fund also noted that increasing fragmentation in the world could be a drag on growth in the future m yellen wa among the most forceful critic of russia during the two day meeting at one point she directly confronted senior russian official in a private session and called them complicit in the kremlin s atrocity the grappling over how to characterize russia s action led bruno le maire the french finance minister to publicly vent his frustration with some country that would not assail russia in writing he noted that when the leader of the group of nation met in november in bali indonesia their statement had asserted that most member strongly condemned the war and he said on friday that he wa opposed to watering down that sentiment i want to make it very clear that we will oppose any step back from the statement of the leader in bali on this question of the war in ukraine mr le maire who declined to name the holdout said at a news conference we strongly condemn this illegal and brutal attack against ukraine india s close economic tie with russia have made it role a the host of the group of this year especially challenging moscow is a major supplier of energy and military equipment to india while the united state is india s largest trading partner to remain neutral india ha tried to avoid describing the conflict a a war and instead focused on other issue in an opening address to the summit prime minister narendra modi laid out the threat facing the global economy but he made no mention of russia pointing instead to rising geopolitical tension in many part of the world some of the resistance to condemning russia is because of concern about the united state use of it economic might to isolate a member of the group of the fact that the u s clearly ha so much power to take action against a geopolitical rival is a significant concern said eswar prasad a trade policy professor at cornell university who speaks to both american and indian official there s clearly been a splintering of the g mr prasad added that the aggressive use of sanction by the united state had raised anxiety among other nation even if they disagreed with russia s action that they could someday be exposed to washington s wrath that use of economic warfare wa on display on friday when the united state imposed sanction on more than individual and entity in russia and other country that are helping to financially support moscow s invasion of ukraine sanction were also placed on russia s metal and mining sector and on energy company the war in ukraine wa not the only matter this past week that consumed finance minister in india the united state and europe continued to hash out difference over american subsidy for electric vehicle that european country believe will harm their economy a global tax agreement that wa struck in continues to flounder raising the prospect that it could unravel and talk over restructuring debt burden facing poor country to avoid a cascade of default failed to bear fruit largely because of resistance from china there hasn t been a significant change that i see said m yellen who expressed frustration at china s role a a roadblock this past week but it is the war in ukraine that ha left the world s economic leader most divided in many case resistance to supporting ukraine and confronting russia is the result of complicated domestic politics in many country and the united state is no exception a growing number of republican including former president donald j trump have been arguing in recent week that the united state cannot afford to endlessly support kyiv they contend that at a time when the united state is burdened by record level of debt and a weakening economy that money would be better spent on domestic problem in the past year the united state ha directed more than billion dollar of humanitarian financial and military aid to ukraine the congressional budget office projected last week that the united state wa on track to add nearly trillion to it national debt over the next decade trillion more than previously forecast for the biden administration scaling back aid to ukraine doe not appear to be an option in the interview m yellen argued that the united state can afford to bear the cost and that supporting ukraine wa a priority for national security and economic reason the war is having an adverse effect on the entire global economy m yellen said and providing the support that s necessary for ukraine to win this and bring it to an end is

economically or using the nuclear card to flip the battlefield dynamic stop the bleeding and prevent nato s expansion into what russia considers it strategic security perimeter the risk of putin using his nuclear card in ukraine will increase a the conflict go on and moscow and washington are climbing the escalation ladder expecting putin to let western arm flow hemorrhage russia out is not rational putin doe not want to use his nuclear card and russia will almost certainly not launch a nuclear strike on the u s homeland outside a direct u s russia military conflict however russian military doctrine doe envision tactical nuclear employment on the battlefield to halt an escalating conflict the strategic disconnect between moscow and washington is that what russia view a de escalatory and defensive nato view a strategic escalation russian and u s leader must understand and soon that their contradictory view and proxy war over ukraine may well lead to a catastrophic outcome rebekah koffler is the president of doctrine strategy consulting a former dia intelligence officer and the author of putin s playbook russia s secret plan to defeat america follow her on twitter rebekah medvedev the current deputy chairman of russia s security council made several radical claim against the u s it nato ally and ukraine in a telegram post marking the one year anniversary of russia s invasion of ukraine he repeated false talking point issued by russian president vladimir putin alleging that russian troop are fighting against neo nazism in ukraine and suggested any attempt to restart peace talk will fail because of the west s determination to weaken moscow and bleed it dry president biden met with leader from the bucharest b in poland earlier this week to reaffirm the u s s commitment to european security and to the alliance that flank the eastern front biden reminded putin earlier this week of the principle of nato s article charter which say that an attack against one nato country will prompt a response from all member nation a warfront that russia is unlikely to be able to handle but it s not only ukraine that moscow ha set it sight on russia ha renewed threat made against moldova a former soviet state west of ukraine and where a contingent of russian sympathizer remain in an area known a transnistria the moldovan government on thursday dismissed claim issued by russia s defense ministry that suggested ukraine planned to invade the russian separatist region european nation have called on the u s to send more troop to be permanently stationed in baltic state like poland a another deterrent against russian aggression but a koffler pointed out threat issued against moldova are not met with the same level of deterrence a those issued against nato ally caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news the people s republic of china ha called for a cease fire between russia and ukraine releasing a point peace plan on the one year anniversary of the invasion china s position paper call for an immediate end of violence in ukraine and a return to dialogue with the aim of ending the conflict through diplomacy china s plan for peace outlined in point consists of the following respecting the sovereignty of all country abandoning the cold war mentality ceasing hostility resuming peace talk resolving the humanitarian crisis protecting civilian and prisoner of war keeping nuclear power plant safe reducing strategic risk facilitating grain export stopping unilateral sanction keeping industrial and supply chain stable promoting post conflict reconstruction a key complaint of the position paper is the increasing influence of military bloc across the globe which china asserts pit nation against each other china ha historically expressed contempt for the north atlantic treaty organization china promised to play a constructive role in peace negotiation chinese official have maintained a vague public attitude toward the russian invasion of ukraine both attesting to their continued friendship with russia and refusing to elaborate on what form of aid it is willing to provide to it ally our first trip to kyiv wa during the tense run up to the invasion last january and february it wa a time of mixed message the u s wa declaring including in a backgrounder we got at the u s embassy in kyiv that moscow wa going to attack various expert analyst told u the same thing right to the brink though including at a press conference we were at president volodymyr zelenskyy wa being cagey he d later say he didn t want to spook the public shortly after that i would get my own chilling news my dear father at the grand age of had passed away this cut short my trip to ukraine in order to get back to new york for his funeral maybe appropriate though that this happened in the midst of news gathering dad long ago instilled in me a passion for current event when i went to the den in his home i found the latest issue of the economist magazine open to a story about ukraine which brings me to feb no i wasn t on the frontline of the invasion i wa in my pajama in the dining room of our home in london in the early hour of the morning i wa getting the latest on every amazing detail of vladimir putin s attack via a what sapp group we had started in kyiv earlier most important were the message from our local producer year old sasha kuvshynova i passed them on to fox news via a mass email group in those early confusing day sasha wa an invaluable source of information for the network and our viewer on the way back to lviv i rang my dear friend and cameraman through thick and thin for the last y year pierre zakrzewski he wa in kyiv working with correspondent and friend benjamin hall and trey yingst covering the incursion by russian force into the suburb of the capital they were reporting on the first wave of death destruction and terror heaped on the ukrainian people by moscow pierre a always wa deep in the mix it would be the last time we d speak my sign offs during the life that night were essentially sad time for ukraine and a sad day for fox news at a proper irish funeral in dublin for pierre the following week we would lift several glass for those we lost and the country that wa under attack and yes the battle did go on remarkably the ukrainian were fighting back with clever tactic and daring deed crucially pushing the russian troop back and away from the outskirt of kyiv and driving them across the border a putin s ill planned push to topple the ukrainian leadership stumbled we went to bucha one of the hardest hit town by russian fighter and saw a long smoothed over patch of dirt next to the main church where body had been buried in a mass grave we visited a long residential street eerily still that day a shooting gallery for russian mercenary a few week back and spoke with resident still breaking down in tear over the horror heaped on them and we went to borodyanka made infamous for a long apartment building with the middle gashed out of it by russian shelling a statue to a ukrainian poet with a bullet through it tin head shop with their front knocked out in many case we were told it wa brave local who stood up and fended off a first wave of russian attack only to get battered by nasty revenge attack day later throughout these trip we spoke with a lot of folk some innocent caught in the fire some helping to lead this young brave democracy people like year old sviat yurash he wa our local producer during the early protest and russian attack in he would become the youngest member of the ukrainian parliament he became famous a image of his lanky frame walking patrol around kyiv a long gun slung over his shoulder spread around the world still the war went on offensive and counter offensive by the time we returned in october and november kyiv had gained back more ground but moscow had a new tactic it couldn t win on the battlefield so it would strike civilian or at least the infrastructure supporting regular folk power station power line water pumping station phone and internet relay station that became the weekly drill air raid siren a distant or not so distant rumble then emergency team racing to a site which we raced to to record the damage and hear from people recounting projectile falling around them and then being left without vital essential a one two putin punch a cemetery we visited in the heart of kyiv also told the tale long row of fresh graf a symbol of the massive toll of this war we spoke with a mother who lost her son a couple who lost a friend two others who were missing a colleague young and old black and white family photo teddy bear football scarf bit of life turned to death also always on our mind the loss of pierre and sasha we stopped a few time during our reporting to see the exact spot where russian missile stole their life all that s left some ugly divot and spray mark from shrapnel on the side of the road flower and memorial card left what wa positive though the remarkable recovery of benjamin hall from terrible wound we had a warm reunion upon our return from the latest trip and so back to this first anniversary of russia s brutal invasion of ukraine and what lie ahead frankly not even u grizzled war correspondent know for sure what seems likely is that vladimir putin will not give up he ha set himself on a road to a brutal take over and until he come close to achieving something he ll continue to throw his cannon fodder into the ugly mix so far the u s and international ally don t look like they re giving up either most country seem willing to up the ante though there are worrying sign including in the u s of flagging enthusiasm greg palkot currently serf a a london based senior foreign affair correspondent for fox news channel fnc he joined the network in a a correspondent follow him on twitter

action not word beijing claim to have a neutral stance in the war that began one year ago but ha also said it ha a no limit friendship with russia and ha refused to criticize moscow s invasion of ukraine or even refer to it a an invasion it ha accused the west of provoking the conflict and fanning the flame by providing ukraine with defensive arm the plan released by china s foreign ministry mainly reiterated long held position and analyst said beijing would be an unlikely broker but some observer warned that ukraine and it ally need to tread carefully saying that rejection of what china see a it peace overture could move beijing closer toward providing arm to russia instead a long a china come up with peacemaker initiative it will be forced to maintain neutrality and to abstain from supplying weapon and direct military assistance to russia fesenko told the associated press ukraine also might see a scenario in which china is at least pressuring russia to contain the use of nuclear weapon and create a mechanism to control nuclear power plant in ukraine he said for beijing s part it needed to clarify it stance whether or not kyiv and moscow pay much heed said shi yinhong a professor of international relation at beijing s renmin university china feel it necessary to repeat it self perceived neutrality at this juncture to save some international influence by not only criticizing nato but also distinguishing itself from russia s behavior shi said china s proposal call for the territorial integrity of all country to be respected but doe not say what will happen to the region russia ha occupied since the invasion it also call for an end to unilateral sanction on russia indirectly criticizes the expansion of the nato alliance and condemns threat of nuclear force

in afghanistan said he s been invited to visit ukraine he said he would like to visit but ha not yet made such an arrangement the associated press contributed to this report one year ago today russian tank rolled into ukraine europe entered into a security crisis not seen since world war ii and black sea blockade created global shock wave that prompted worldwide food shortage but instead the world watched a the real time david v goliath story unfolded and ukrainian troop held strong against one of the largest most sophisticated military in the world stopping putin in his track basic logistical failure like fuel shortage stalled russian effort within the first week of the invasion showing a level of unpreparedness in moscow s rank that flabbergasted western defense official it is a relentless attrition of manpower koffler said and he s clearly preparing for a very very protracted battle defense official and ukrainian soldier on the front line have reported that the constant supply of russian troop funneled into ukraine are inadequately supplied lack sufficient training and are being killed at increasing rate in mid february a bbc russia investigation found that in the confirmed death of over conscripted men mobilized after putin s september order of them were killed after the new year signaling a spike in frontline death kyiv ha estimated that russian force have lost up to men a day in the bakhmut sector alone it is now believed that russia s offensive charge will come in wave closer to the spring time when the weather let up and will likely not be one united push it s a war in which tactic and equipment and the smart use of modern technology are a decisive factor not the sheer number of armed force sak explained pointing to how the battlefield dynamic in ukraine shifted once kyiv had received high mobility artillery rocket system himars last summer that wa a turning point he said we were able to reach the enemy ammunition depot and command center deeper inside their territory it s always important to try to be one step ahead of the enemy not one step behind sak added hoffman argued the west s hesitancy and repeated decision reversal to send adequate aid to ukraine is what ha prolonged this war to begin with koffler argued that putin s true aim is in blocking ukraine from being accepted into nato and so long a the nation is embroiled in a war it will not be eligible to join the military alliance the ukrainian defense adviser said that ultimately ukraine will keep doing what it must in the continued face of russian aggression fight caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news wall street journal editorial board member kimberley strassel condemned former president trump s foreign policy stance and warned gop leader like gov ron desantis r fla against following his lead it would muddy mr desantis s ability to otherwise take a tough line on the world s rogue including china it would give mr biden who is already gunning for mr desantis an easy attack line and it would put the governor crosswise with most congressional republican many of whom are rooting for him she continued alexander hall is an associate editor for fox news digital story tip can be sent to alexander hall fox com washington president biden marked the start of a second year of war in europe on friday by announcing billion of dollar in additional military aid for ukraine imposing more sanction on those helping president vladimir v putin of russia and delivering a grim warning about an alliance between russia and iran just day after making a secret trip to ukraine s capital mr biden joined the leader of the other group of nation canada france germany italy japan and britain in reaffirming his support for the beleaguered country and condemning russia s invasion a year ago a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase the people s love of liberty mr biden wrote in a statement on twitter alluding to mr putin brutality will never grind down the will of the free and ukraine will never be a victory for russia never the biden administration announced economic sanction on more than individual and entity in russia and other country that it say are supporting moscow s war the pentagon also said on friday that it would spend billion to supply the ukrainian military with new drone and anti drone system a well a additional ammunition for artillery and long range rocket system in an interview with abc news s david muir on friday night however mr biden said he wa ruling out sending f fighter jet for now together the effort build on a more than yearlong campaign to leverage economic and military tool against mr putin but the prospect of sanction imposed by the united state and it ally did not prevent the invasion nor ha their implementation forced the russian leader to negotiate an end to his brutal war and on friday mr biden s administration said it see growing evidence that russia may be planning to provide iran with fighter jet a part of a deepening military relationship with implication for the ukraine war and security in the middle east john f kirby a spokesman for the national security council did not offer detailed intelligence evidence to support the accusation but said u s official believe that the possible provision of jet to iran follows shipment of artillery round from iran to russia in november iran shipped artillery and tank round to russia for use in ukraine mr kirby said and russia is planning to cooperate with iran to obtain even more military equipment in return russia ha been offering iran unprecedented defense cooperation including on missile electronics and air defense the announcement come a the united state ha warned that china may also be considering whether to provide military support to russia on friday evening mr biden said there wa no evidence of that so far i had a long conversation with xi about this in the summer he said referring to president xi jinping of china i said look this is not a threat it s just a statement when in fact european saw what wa happening and american saw what wa happening in russia in europe guess what six hundred corporation pulled out and left i said you told me the future of china rest on investment from the western world that matter i said i d just keep an eye on it the potential new support for russia by iran and china is among the far reaching global ramification of the yearlong war which ha reshaped alliance on both side of the conflict the impact on the battlefield could be significant mr kirby said if iran is helping mr putin get around the western sanction intended to cripple his ability to equip his force but mr kirby noted that the partnership also raise concern for the middle east where the delivery of russian fighter jet to iran could alter the power dynamic in the region the revelation about iran s potential dealing with russia came a president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine addressed the group of nation in a virtual gathering friday morning mr zelensky said in a statement on the telegram messaging app that he had presented the leader with detailed request for more support in five area a he try to defend his country and reclaim territory seized by the russian over the past year weapon sanction finance justice and unity i thanked the partner for their unity and help during this year mr zelensky wrote we withstood we started to free our land from russian evil we are in a return of security to international relation and we know that our coalition of defender of freedom can become a coalition of winner in a mr zelensky and the other leader declared their unity the united state announced a series of broad new action aimed at helping ukraine on the battlefield and increasing the economic pressure on russia official at the treasury department said the sanction would target more than people and company in country outside russia that are connected to the effort to evade existing prohibition they include the moretti procurement network a trading group run by walter moretti a swiss italian business executive treasury official said among the targeted company are those helping to produce carbon fiber which can be used in military equipment the official said treasury official said that russian who have already been cut off from large multinational banking system have frequently tried to access their money through smaller bank the new sanction will target several smaller bank across the globe the official said the commerce department on friday added company and organization that it said had aided russia s war or engaged in other activity contrary to u s national security interest to a list that prevents them from buying certain u s product and technology seventy nine of the sanctioned entity are in russia while others are based in china canada france luxembourg and the netherlands the department said the department also placed restriction on selling technology to iran following the discovery of iranian drone on the ukrainian battlefield white house official said the united state would raise tariff on about billion worth of russian metal mineral and chemical product and that it would use tariff to significantly increase cost for aluminum that is smelted or cast in russia the arm and munition announced friday unlike much of what america ha previously shipped will not come out of defense department stockpile rather the united state will buy the item from manufacturer and send them to ukraine a process that is intended to sustain ukraine s long term military need but delay delivery by month or even year the united state provided about billion in aid to ukraine last year much of it military assistance in late december congress approved an additional billion in ukraine aid to be spent over the course of the year friday s announcement wa part of that more recent funding the latest offering includes cyberlux k switchblade altius and jump drone system according to a pentagon statement it also includes additional ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket system or himars millimeter artillery round munition for laser guided rocket system mine clearing equipment and communication gear today s solemn anniversary is an opportunity for all who believe in freedom rule and sovereignty to recommit ourselves to supporting ukraine s brave defender for the long haul and to recall that the stake of russia s war stretch far beyond ukraine defense secretary lloyd j austin iii said in a statement that accompanied the aid announcement the state department announced more than billion in new nonmilitary aid to ukraine nearly all of it direct budgetary support for it government the money is meant to help maintain basic service like health care and education at the united nation secretary of state antony j blinken said ukraine had become an inspiration to the world every step of the way ukraine ha shown it will not be subjugated mr blinken wrote on twitter the united state proudly stand with ukraine a it defends itself and we will continue to do so for a long a it take transportation secretary pete buttigieg in particular wa slammed for delaying his first visit to east palestine to thursday which wa one day after former president trump paid a visit other subject biden wa asked about during the abc news interview included the one year anniversary of the russia ukraine war china and it spy balloon his ongoing classified document scandal and whether he will seek reelection in joseph a wulfsohn is a medium reporter for fox news digital story tip can be sent to joseph wulfsohn fox com and on twitter josephwulfsohn but more significantly the wikileaks scandal threatened to split the democratic party into piece more than million bernie sander voter many of them young people learned that the process they had always believed in wa in fact a sham they had been cheated democratic leader had to act quickly in the face of this to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else the dnc s server they claimed had been hacked by the russian military the goal wa to hurt hillary clinton whom the russian feared for her strength and wisdom and to help donald trump whom they controlled russia hacked the server in order to hack the election that wa their story the washington post ran with it the first day a if it were true but there wa never any evidence that it wa true almost seven year later there is still no evidence the dnc s story about it server is a lie but a a political strategy that lie worked flawlessly russia made the perfect villain it wa a white christian country with a traditional social structure it wa everything the democratic party already opposed the foreign policy apparatus in washington wa happy to hate russia again after year of cold war hating russia wa muscle memory so soon the leader of both party in washington signed on to the russia collusion hoax it had the twin benefit of paralyzing the trump administration which it did and justifying the expansion of the national security state a the year passed and the rhetoric intensified hysteria set in after awhile anyone with a heterodox opinion from right winger to avowed socialist could be accused of working secretly for vladimir putin many were accused and some were destroyed by it it wa a textbook witch hunt far more effective than mccarthyism and unlike mccarthyism it never ended russia remained america s greatest enemy even a china emerged a america s greatest threat over time the lie that democrat told to hide their crime in the primary came to dominate america s foreign policy and then to imperil america itself for generation statesman and diplomat worked to prevent other great power from aligning a a block against the u s the idea wa pretty straightforward you might be able to beat one strong country but if a couple of strong country ever got together you would lose this is why richard nixon went to china to make sure the chinese government didn t align with brezhnev with the russian donald trump understood this very clearly russia will never be our closest ally he said but if russia ever becomes china s ally we re in deep trouble the combination of natural resource military and economic power and sheer population would make the russian chinese alliance the most powerful force in the world the united state would soon be dethroned we d be taking order a trump put it there is no reason to make russia our enemy and there are many reason not to but the war we are fighting in ukraine is not against russia alone but also against russia s newest ally the people s republic of china what donald trump predicted ha happened and in the worst way if the war in ukraine continues we will lose no matter how it end the world order is being reshuffled a we watch and by the time it s over the u s will no longer be at the top of the deck that is very obvious to the rest of the world president biden the russian military ha begun a brutal assault on the people of ukraine without provocation without justification without necessity this aggression cannot go unanswered if it did the consequence for america would be much worse america stand up to bully we stand up for freedom putin is the aggressor putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequence today i m authorizing additional strong sanction strong sanction that ll do it now the goal at that point a year ago today you may remember this wa to push russian force back into their own country to reverse the invasion and that seemed reasonable to most people it did not seem like the beginning of a third world war but it wa exactly that and by december lindsey graham wa confident enough to say so out loud here he is sen lindsey graham how doe this war end when russia break and they take putin out anything short of that the war is going to continue to ask the ukrainian to give russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen to signal a cease fire russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again so we re in it to win it and the only way you re going to win it is to break the russian military and have somebody in russia take putin out so what happens next in this war well according to our elderly treasury secretary janet yellen the war in ukraine will go on forever and so will our support for zelenskyy secretary yellen let me make clear the united state and the ally our support for ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this how we plan to defeat russia and it ally china and then build utopia the piece is notably light on detail now you d feel a little better hearing all this if tom nichols and others like him in washington had a track record that suggested they could do any of this a track record of competence and success they don t nichols himself seems to spend most of his life arguing with other people on twitter he s never achieved anything at all that we re aware of but then virtually none of them have achieved anything biden s chief ukraine strategist victoria nuland you would not hire her to plan spring break she couldn t do it she doesn t have the skill but none of this ever occurs to people like tom nichols and victoria nuland and for that matter joe biden the more discredited they are the more self confident they become they see every failure a evidence that their talent are more desperately needed than ever what is this well it s called hubris hubris ha caused more suffering than polio it s caused more death than smallpox and apparently we re in the middle of another epidemic of it washington after russia invaded ukraine last year president biden reflected privately on his long distance conversation with president volodymyr zelensky he did not know the man well and might never get to it wa chilling several people remember him observing grimly to think that he might be talking with a dead man mr biden wa hardly the only one to assume that mr zelensky might not survive the russian onslaught given the target the kremlin had put on his back but the american president wa happy to be proved wrong and surprised to discover like the rest of the world that mr zelensky wa more than a former comedian and tougher than anyone imagined by the time mr biden made a dramatic unannounced visit to wartime kyiv this week the two had grown close enough to greet each other with the easy familiarity of old friend how are the child mr biden asked it s amazing to see you he added perhaps still shocked that the ukrainian president ha escaped russian effort to kill him mr zelensky inquired about jill biden she s doing well the president replied she s still teaching it ha not always been so convivial the two leader have been on a remarkable journey together since the invasion one year ago on friday forging a partnership that is critical to the future of the international order but xa that at time ha been fraught with friction according to official in both camp who asked not to be identified mr biden ha secured xa billion in military and other aid to be delivered to xa ukraine but in their telephone call it ha never been enough for mr zelensky who press for more more more faster faster faster it took month to develop a better understanding of each other and smooth over hard feeling it is after all a relationship of necessity but not of equal one of mutual interest but disparate priority if mr zelensky is a modern day winston churchill a admirer often say then mr biden find himself assigned the role of franklin d roosevelt before pearl harbor mustering the so called arsenal of democracy to arm european ally without drawing the united state directly into a war while mr biden share mr zelensky s goal of driving out russian invader he worry about provoking president vladimir v putin into escalating the war beyond ukraine s border or into a nuclear conflict mr biden s reluctance to provide the most advanced weaponry vexes mr zelensky but the ukrainian ha learned how to slowly wear down resistance to eventually get much of what he want both are really determined and strong leader said igor novikov a former adviser to mr zelensky on american affair when their interest align it s the best relationship ever if there are misunderstanding or different point of view emotion pop up i classify it a a complicated relationship not in the bad sense but it s complicated the tension is inherent to their different position and responsibility there s just a basic structural thing here that ha nothing to do with the personality of biden or zelensky said michael a mcfaul an ambassador to russia under president barack obama who is regularly in touch with ukrainian leader zelensky is trying to save his country mr mcfaul said there s nothing worse than getting the report at the end of the day about how many people have died nobody should be surprised that he want more all the time he belief and i think he s right that this is the way this war end a for the american president mr mcfaul said biden feel rightly so that he s mobilized the world and he s mobilized america and the pentagon ha done more than it s ever done before and he s frustrated he doesn t get more praise for that a wartime ally go mr biden and mr zelensky are a historical odd couple an year old career politician who became a pillar of his country s political establishment and a year old satirist who once played a president on television but had never served in public office before being elected to lead his nation mr biden came of age during the cold war and wa first sworn into the senate xa five year before mr zelensky wa born mr zelensky wa when his country emerged from the collapsing soviet union a an independent country their relationship wa burdened before they ever met shortly after mr zelensky wa elected in president donald j trump pressured him xa to investigate mr biden a demand that led to impeachment new to government mr zelensky felt burned assuming the byzantine maneuvering wa the norm for american politics and wary of where it left him when mr biden defeated mr trump it did not go unnoticed in kyiv that mr biden spoke by phone with mr putin in january just six day after taking office while mr zelensky did not get a call until april mr biden did not even nominate an ambassador to ukraine until a year later two month after the russian invasion in summer while mr biden met with mr putin in geneva the ukrainian lashed out at visiting american official for not imposing sanction xa on germany over it new nord stream pipeline with russia by winter a russian troop gathered on the ukrainian border and american intelligence concluded that mr putin planned to invade mr zelensky remained skeptical of mr biden s public warning when the ukrainian leader decided to travel to the munich security conference last february mr biden s team advised him not to leave his country in case it wa attacked he attended anyway rallying international support and returning before the invasion biden administration official privately also pressed mr zelensky to develop a succession plan in case something happened to him because the ukrainian constitution only called for the speaker of parliament to fill a vacancy and listed no one else in line on the night of the invasion mr biden and mr zelensky spoke by telephone it wa a harrowing moment for the young ukrainian who wa in a capital facing a brutal assault during his visit to ukraine this week mr biden recounted their conversation you told me that you could hear the explosion in the background mr biden recalled i ll never forget that and the world wa about to change i remember it vividly because i asked you i asked you next i asked you what is there mr president what can i do for you how can i be of help and i don t know that you remember what you said to me but you said and i quote gather the leader of the world ask them to support ukraine and you said that you didn t know when we d be able to speak again mr biden continued that dark night one year ago the world wa literally at the time bracing for the fall of kyiv it seems like a lot longer ago than a year but think back to that year perhaps even the end of ukraine the biden team assumed that mr zelensky would either be killed or lead a government in exile but clad in an olive green sweatshirt he refused suggestion to leave kyiv angry that the american doubted ukraine s resolve ukrainian official spread the story that mr zelensky rebuffed the suggestion with a memorable quote i need ammunition not a ride the biden team considers xa the story apocryphal a former administration official said but wa impressed by the mythmaking which is a common tool of war le than a week after the invasion mr biden told television anchor at an off the record lunch that he saw no offramp to get mr putin to stop he said he believed russia would be able to defeat ukraine taking major city and he expected many people to die according to an account from in the room the idea that ukraine could beat the russian is not going to happen mr biden said he acknowledged that to occupy and control the country wa a more daunting challenge but believed that mr putin s only game plan wa to topple mr zelensky and set up a puppet government the assumption that moscow would quickly xa win influenced a strategic decision by mr biden that proved an enduring source of grievance with mr zelensky american official feared sending sophisticated weaponry to ukraine that might fall into russian hand much like in afghanistan when mr biden withdrew troop the previous year so they were restrained in what they sent in what became regular conversation with mr biden however mr zelensky relentlessly pushed for more often skipping lightly over the gratitude for what the american had provided and instead presenting a list of what they had not mr biden bristled at the president of the united state being treated like a supply sergeant according to administration official believing that such list should be discussed by their aide while the two leader focused on higher level question on at least one occasion last summer a reported by nbc news mr biden lost his temper when he called to tell mr zelensky about billion in aid he had just approved only to have the ukrainian leader immediately list what else he needed zelensky learned early on that it wa a mistake not to provide the list mr mcfaul said he learned that the best way to get the system to work wa to give the list and biden didn t like it absolutely mr zelensky s approach stemmed from living in a capital under regular bombardment in zelensky s view the weapon delivery are appreciated but extremely slow mr novikov said for those delay we are paying with ukrainian blood biden administration official appreciated the strain mr zelensky wa under if i were in your position i would be doing the exact same thing mr biden would tell mr zelensky according to a senior official in the early week of the war the official said mr zelensky would sign off call with mr biden by saying this may be the last time i see you but biden official xa privately appealed to mr zelensky s team to handle the phone call differently the situation improved once bridget a brink the new american ambassador arrived last spring and mr biden ha often given in to mr zelensky eventually agreeing to send himars guided rocket launcher a patriot antimissile battery and m abrams tank all of which he initially withheld the relationship ha grown stronger in recent month mr zelensky s xa splashy visit to washington just before christmas seemed to make an impression on mr biden and his national security adviser jake sullivan who call himself the quartermaster of the ukraine war xa and work closely with andriy yermak mr zelensky s top adviser and mr biden s return trip to kyiv highlighted their solidarity a mr zelensky thanked him profusely for help that will be remembered eternally while pressing for additional weapon more gently at the beginning it wa a quite rocky relationship and there s still a certain rockiness but le said john herbst a former american ambassador to ukraine who ha praised mr biden for the aid but argues that it ha been way too slow to this day the administration still complains that the ukrainian are ingrate and that s because they refuse to look critically at their own policy speaking by telephone from kyiv mr herbst said mr biden s visit went a long way toward cementing the partnership with mr zelensky to a point i know the ukrainian loved the visit he said him being on the street of kyiv struck a real chord and demonstrated the support they wanted to see but the elite are still asking where s the beef the war ha already done untold damage by some estimate ten of thousand have died on both side and the country ha sustained ten of billion of dollar worth of damage that ha left city flattened but ukraine ha also largely stopped the offensive of it much larger and better armed neighbor and ha regained some captured land on the first anniversary of russia s invasion these ukrainian reflect on how the past year of conflict ha changed their life a year of war in ukraine ha reshaped the world in way few had predicted far beyond the front line the ripple effect of russia s invasion have reordered life and upended economy here is a look at the war s consequence in six key area the war helped push global grain price to record high given the importance of russia and ukraine a exporter of food crop including wheat the united nation warned that million of people especially in part of africa and the middle east were threatened with famine in july moscow and kyiv signed an agreement to release million of ton of grain stuck in ukraine s black sea port because of a de facto russian naval blockade although russia briefly suspended it participation in the deal in october the agreement ha largely held and global grain price have returned to prewar level the war unleashed the worst global energy crisis since the s energy price soared in many part of the world a nation reduced or cut off their purchase of russian fossil fuel in europe gas bill nearly doubled and electricity cost spiked about percent in the first six month of the war european union diplomat in december agreed on a per barrel limit on the price at which russian oil can be traded outside the bloc in another bid to deprive moscow of revenue for the war but with global supply tight russia ha remained a dominant exporter selling more oil and gas to china and india over the last year the global economy wa just emerging from the pandemic and the energy crisis and slower growth contributed to higher inflation soaring price ate away at people s saving and paycheck causing real wage to fall in many country and slashing purchasing power high inflation ha become a political headache for leader in country including the united state france and britain with government raising spending to ease the pain for family and business using price cap subsidy and reduced tax president biden said this week in warsaw that nato is stronger than it s ever been president vladimir v putin of russia may have hoped his invasion would exacerbate division in nato but the alliance ha been galvanized finland which share a border with russia abandoned it policy of neutrality and applied to join the alliance a did sweden nato leader have said they expect that both will win approval although turkey ha raised objection over sweden s treatment of kurdish group that ankara regard a terrorist in september ukraine applied to join although it bid is considered a long shot more than eight million ukrainian fled a refugee to other part of europe particularly in the early stage of the war according to the united nation refugee agency another five million are estimated to be displaced inside ukraine the highest number of refugee more than million are registered in poland at the same time the war ha enhanced the influence on the continent of poland and the baltic state which have embraced stout defense of ukraine and pushed for greater and faster supply of military aid europe s traditional leader france and germany struggled early on with the delicate task of reorienting their longstanding policy of a european security structure that included cooperation with russia china ha walked a fine line during the war calling for peace while refraining from criticizing russia an increasingly important partner china s top diplomat wang yi on a tour of europe this week told his ukrainian counterpart that he did not want to see the war prolonged and escalated at the same time china is holding joint military drill with russia and south africa and china s leader xi jinping is expected to pay a state visit to moscow in the spring the biden administration is watching closely for sign that china may cross the line into providing direct military support to russia and ha warned it against doing so but beijing ha pushed back strongly against the u s accusation kyiv ukraine in a wide ranging hourslong news conference in a basement in the heart of kyiv the ukrainian capital president volodymyr zelensky said friday that he wa confident his country could win the war this year expressed hope that china would not provide lethal military aid to russia and implored israel to get off the fence and side with his nation on the anniversary of russia s full scale invasion mr zelensky offered a broad overview of where the war stood the challenge ukraine faced and the opportunity in the month ahead not one to shrink from question or to shy away from calling out even ally if he feel they could be doing more to help ukraine he nevertheless tread carefully when talking about china asked about report that beijing wa considering providing moscow with lethal weapon mr zelensky initially ignored the question when it wa raised a second time he said that working to ensure china did not arm russia wa one of his top priority i really want to believe that china is not going to supply weapon to russia he said such a move would not only cause problem for ukraine he said but would raise the risk of a third world war adding i want to believe china is going to side with the idea of peace and fairness about an hour later the subject of china came up again this time from a chinese journalist why should country a geographically distant from ukraine a china side with kyiv mr zelensky had the question translated a second time and then engaged the reporter directly telling her that it wa not about geography or geopolitics but basic principle doe china believe that innocent should not be killed that a nuclear power plant should not be occupied that respect for the sovereign right of a nation mean an invader should withdraw i am already starting public diplomatic relation here he said before switching to english to stress his openness to direct talk with china we have so many common issue we have to speak between u with no one else mr zelensky s confidence in ukraine s victory is premised on the idea that moscow will not find a way to quickly and robustly rebuild it battered military if china begin supplying the arsenal for putin s army all current thinking about the course of the war could be upended but it is not just china that mr zelensky is concerned about iran is already providing attack drone to russia and the west ha warned the moscow is also seeking to acquire ballistic missile it wa in this context that mr zelensky wa asked about israel israel and ukraine share a common enemy he wa asked so why are they not stronger ally again mr zelensky wa careful not to alienate a potential ally israel s targeting of iranian drone and missile production facility in iran is probably more important than word of public support he said that he understood israel s long and complex history with russia but said that xa he had xa wished for israel to take a firmer stance xa against it since the start of the war i really want them to be more than a mediator but to choose a side he said the ukrainian side there were hard question about possible internal dispute in his government there wa also a journalist from azerbaijan who simply wanted a selfie with the ukrainian leader for his son mr zelensky obliged when asked mr zelensky briefly ruminated about his personal life and the difficulty xa of being away from his wife and child the ukrainian leader said the darkest moment of the war for him personally wa when he saw the atrocity committed by russian soldier for the first time in bucha it wa horrible he said the best moment he said is yet to come victory day is going to be the happiest day for me and every ukrainian he said over more than two and half hour question about how and when ukraine could win the war were the most frequent even if that answer would only be determined on the battlefield ukraine can win the war this year he said a long a it ally remain united like a fist and western weapon continue to be delivered on agreed upon timeline i am confident we will have this victory and hope it will happen this year he said mr zelensky dismissed the idea of negotiation with moscow saying that at this moment they would make no sense before any talk he said russia would have to stop the destruction and killing and respect the right of ukrainian to live on ukrainian land you go ahead and stop doing all of that and only after that we ll tell you what form will be used to diplomatically put an end to it he said at the one year mark of russia s invasion of ukraine president vladimir v putin and president biden both insisted this week that they were committed to the fight mr putin prepared russia for a long war to be waged step by step while the american president said we will not tire in the quest to ensure a democratic ukraine and in a news conference in kyiv on friday president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said he wa certain his country would win calling victory inevitable but none of the leader made it clear what an attainable victory might look like while hitching their legacy to a war with no discernible end putin is a committed a he s ever been to his grand victory said eugene rumer a former american intelligence officer and the director of the russia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington ukrainian are a committed a ever to defeating putin even if it will be at a most terrible price declaring the resolve to fight on however is much easier than mustering the resource and support to do so ukraine with a population le than a third that of russia and an economy devastated by the invasion is increasingly dependent on western aid russia facing sanction and voluminous frontline casualty depends on close tie and economic cooperation with china a well a a populace and a ruling elite that remain willing to accept the pain caused by mr putin s war on the battlefield russia s winter offensive ha so far been underwhelming ukraine is widely expected to mount a spring offensive of it own but is running low on ammunition and ukrainian official say is desperate for better weaponry mr zelensky face the twin task of keeping his country s morale high and maintaining the resolve of western ally of all ukraine s challenge the latter is perhaps the most urgent having held onto western support through the winter when economic upheaval threatened to break the will of european country making domestic sacrifice leader in kyiv a well a mr biden must work to maintain solidarity at the munich security conference last weekend the full throated expression of support for ukraine rarely included specific and in the corridor western official and analyst privately expressed le sanguine view about ukraine s ability to achieve it stated goal of full victory they spoke of anxiety about the length of the conflict the sustainability of weapon supply and the political cost of higher inflation and more expensive energy and food american and european leader repeated in public that it wa solely up to ukraine to define the aim of the conflict and decide when it is ready to negotiate an end to it but some analyst believe that the risk of escalation by russia and the blowback effect on the global economy mean that it is in washington s interest to push ukraine toward more realistic war aim and eventual negotiation with moscow it is time for the united state and it ally to get directly involved in shaping ukraine s strategic objective managing the conflict and seeking a diplomatic endgame said charles a kupchan a former obama administration official with the council on foreign relation senior american and european official understand that they too have their own national interest that may not perfectly coincide with those of kyiv the main reason being that while nato country will supply the ukrainian and train them they will not fight alongside them the united state ha also been carefully calibrating the weapon it supply the ukrainian to try to ensure that nato is not dragged into a larger war with russia the problem is that the united state give ukraine enough to push the russian back but not enough to win said angela e stent a scholar specializing in russian affair at georgetown university and the author of putin s world mr putin however face his own gap between rhetoric and reality he describes a pro western ukraine a a mortal threat an anti russia he said again in his state of the nation speech on tuesday but he ha not explained how the minuscule territorial gain that russia s grinding fighting is eking out will bring the rest of ukraine back into moscow s orbit the russian leader still appears convinced that his victory will be sealed off the battlefield betting that if he keep up the fight long enough ukrainian will eventually tire of resistance and western voter will rise up against their current leader mr putin the carnegie analyst tatiana stanovaya said think of his territorial conquest of ukrainian land a just part of a broader multipronged conflict he want a new architecture of international security she said he want non expansion of nato he want capitulation by kyiv grabbing ukrainian region is just in addition crucial signal about the future of the war will come most visibly on the battlefield moscow s winter offensive ha so far delivered only minor gain a failed attack near the town of vuhledar saw more of the russian dysfunction that plagued it invasion early in the war ukrainian official say moscow s stock of artillery and missile is running low and that morale remains a big problem but mr putin with little domestic pushback ha million of russian he can throw into battle and american official say that russia is currently trying to persuade china to provide military support an alarming scenario for ukraine and it ally on paper russia s size would appear to give it a growing advantage a the war drag on it occupies one tenth of the earth s landmass with some of it most prized natural resource nevertheless mr putin will face hard decision a he seek to keep up the fight he will need to weigh any potential escalation in his war effort against the potential pushback from china and india critical economic partner for russia and he will need to keep an eye on the potential for domestic instability a he weighs whether to declare another draft ahead of a possible new offensive his partial mobilization of civilian last fall thrust russia into it biggest domestic crisis since the war began a ten of thousand of young men clogged airport and border crossing to escape being sent to the front analyst believe that mr putin will need to call up more force in order to have a chance at substantial territorial gain on the battlefield that ha become even more apparent in recent week a russia ha suffered some of it heaviest casualty of the war and it main alternative to conscription convict recruited from russian prison ha dried up they will need personnel replenishment said dara massicot a senior policy researcher at the rand corporation focusing on russia it s just a question of is it going to be small rolling call ups or is it going to be another large batch and that answer will depend on how far they think they can take an offensive in the presidential administration building in kyiv the ukrainian capital mr zelensky s senior leadership ha been huddling in office spread across a labyrinth of hallway and secret corridor behind towering column and sandbag for ukrainian official balancing military strategy with diplomatic reality ha been a challenge since mr zelensky emerged from his bunker a year ago to plead for western ally to provide weapon and ammunition to beat back russian invader pressing in on the capital official in kyiv have said that they do not think russia can continue to sustain the loss of men and equipment at the rate it is currently being battered forever and will try to find a way to pause the conflict by increasing international pressure for a cease fire the kremlin s best chance of succeeding ukrainian official say is convincing ukraine s international partner that kyiv cannot prevail the longer russia occupies part of ukraine they say the more it can cripple ukraine physically economically and psychologically while it rebuilds it own arsenal so the faster that more powerful weapon like tank longer range precision missile armored fighting vehicle and fighter jet are put in the hand of ukrainian soldier they add the faster the war can be brought to an end mr biden s dramatic visit to kyiv and the commitment of another billion in military assistance made it clear that the american support critical for ukraine s survival would continue a kyiv plan to go on the offensive in coming month the timing of weapon supply from our partner wa a major concern said oleksiy danilov the head of the ukrainian national security and defense council the longer it take the more people we lose in a recent interview mr danilov noted the comparison popping up in medium outlet comparing ukraine and korea raising the notion that a th parallel akin to the line that divided north and south korea could be imposed in ukraine but he dismissed such talk a moscow fueled propaganda in his news conference on friday mr zelensky also rejected the idea of a settlement under current condition for there to be peace he said russia must stop committing atrocity like murdering ukrainian child and bombing ukrainian city and show that it can respect the right of ukrainian to live on ukrainian land only then will we tell you the form we can use to put an end to the war he said kyiv ukraine president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine marked the anniversary xa of the russian invasion on friday with a show of defiance a anti kremlin protest took place around the world and the united state made a significant commitment of new weaponry to the country even a he and his ally braced for a prolonged war mr zelensky held a marathon news conference in kyiv the capital to rally international xa support declaring that ukraine and the ally supplying it with weapon and other aid would prevail if we stay a one strong fist and our partner are united for our victory i am certain there will be victory he said i don t think i know it will happen this year we have everything for it motivation belief friend diplomacy china released an outline for a peace settlement that the west dismissed a a vague nonstarter that might serve only to cement into place russian gain the move came a the united state ha been warning that beijing might send weapon to russia which could dramatically alter the balance in a fight where both side have run low on vital munition mr zelensky took care not to say anything that might provoke beijing the powerful moscow ally that he hope will remain largely on the sideline of the war continuing his long balancing act between condemning russia while avoiding direct criticism of china asked about china on friday he said little about it proposal and merely expressed hope that the country would not arm russia on the prospect for peace talk the warring nation continued to talk past one another each setting precondition that the other would call capitulation the russian ambassador to the united nation vasily a nebenzya told the security council that his country would only negotiate on how it goal in ukraine could be achieved mr zelensky said that russia must halt it violence against ukraine and respect ukrainian sovereignty before there could be any talk and asked what negotiation wa possible with a nation that continued to kill civilian those civilian did not have gun in their hand they had their child in their hand he said a the security council met in new york to discus the war protester outside held up an effigy of president vladimir v putin of russia with bloodied hand in brussels hundred of people gathered in a cold drizzle outside the european parliament to unfurl a giant ukrainian flag sing the ukrainian national anthem and chant slava ukraini or glory to ukraine world leader issued statement deploring the invasion and noting that a year of bloodshed and destruction had passed with no end in sight in buenos aire people gathered in front of the barricaded russian embassy playing russian rock anthem on speaker and waving ukrainian flag and bearing sign with message like russia without putin this war is a lie said aleksandr fitasov one of the event organizer in buenos aire it s just to defend president putin s power so he remains president and to satisfy his empire ambition to recreate the great russia with all the territory many of the protester in buenos aire were among the thousand of russian who have fled their country during the war including some with baby born to parent who hoped that foreign birth certificate and passport would give their child brighter future russian opposition group say they have organized event in city in country over the next three day to protest the war even in russia where dissent ha been criminalized there were scattered act of protest on friday from the subtle to the unmistakable and at least arrest according to right group in a village near saint petersburg dmitri skurikhin painted the name of city russia ha ravaged on the facade of his store and knelt outside with a sign saying forgive u ukraine act that could get him five year in prison in a park in moscow a steady trickle of people laid flower at a statue of the ukrainian poet larysa kosach kvitka better known a lesya ukrainka while two police officer watched from a parked squad car nearby in order for russia to become a free and democratic country it must lose this particular war in order for the government to change said one of the flower bearer nikolai an year old student whose full name is being withheld for his safety in general however xa the mood in moscow wa one of business a usual with many people saying that they had given little thought to the war or to russia s isolation there wa little news on friday xa from the battlefield where the war ha already done damage beyond comprehension hundred of thousand killed or wounded hundred of billion of dollar in damage city and town almost completely flattened million of ukrainian made homeless and million more struggling through winter with insufficient shelter heat or electricity or even in some case enough food and water the war ha reverberated around the globe reshaping and strengthening alliance and affecting everything from grain price to energy policy but even though russia ha found itself more isolated from the west and sanction have damaged the country s economy they have failed to bring it to it knee china india and others continue to trade with moscow and provide it with diplomatic support throughout the war china ha presented itself a neutral even a it ha aligned more closely with russia the proposal it released on friday call for peace talk and xa a cease fire though russia still hold a large swath of ukrainian territory in four province it claim to have annexed it doe not call for withdrawal of russian troop beijing repeated point it had made before without naming any country a perpetrator or victim in language broad enough to be open to interpretation the chinese statement call for respecting the sovereignty of all country but doe not address mr putin s insistence that ukraine is not a real country xa and merely a temporarily estranged part of russia and it call for an end to sanction imposed without approval from the security council where russia and china both hold veto power a reference to the penalty the united state the european union and britain have imposed on russia security is not an exclusive right enjoyed only by some country wang yi china s top foreign policy official told the security council xa the security of one country should not be pursued at the expense of others mr nebenzya the russian ambassador praised the chinese statement while at the same meeting antony j blinken the u s secretary of state dismissed it without mentioning it directly member of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both side to stop fighting or calling on other nation to stop supporting ukraine in the name of peace he said in this war there is an aggressor and a victim he added the biden administration on friday announced a new round of sanction against russian people and entity it also announced the release of billion in additional military aid raising the u s total to about billion in the past year although president biden on friday night said in an interview with abc news that he wa ruling out sending ukraine f fighter jet for the moment the european union britain and canada also announced new sanction when mr zelensky wa xa asked at his news conference about the possibility of china sending weapon to russia he at first ducked the question but minute later it wa asked again i really want to believe that china is not going to supply weapon to russia he said adding that it would elevate the risk of a world war i want to believe china is going to side with the idea of peace and fairness mr zelensky wa more directly critical of israel a country with western alliance that ha offered limited quiet support for ukraine while trying to remain on good term with russia i really want them to be more than a mediator but to choose a side he said the ukrainian side sliding easily between ukrainian and english mr zelensky demonstrated his penchant for courting western medium and their audience he spent well over two hour answering question often at some length acknowledging uncertainty on some front but insisting i am confident we will have this victory and hope it will happen this year he opened his news conference by thanking the news medium and noting the journalist foreign and domestic who had died covering the war the fact that the whole world is not forgetting about ukraine this allows u to remain strong to remain invincible he said he then stood for a minute of silence citizen of ukraine who are trying to travel to russia or belarus from the

the u led military bloc had seen any indication that china might provide weapon or other assistance to russia we have seen some sign that they may be planning for that and of course nato ally the united state have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen he said insisting beijing must not take any role in the conflict in ukraine the nato chief went on to argue

ukraine beijing china wa quick to respond to stoltenberg s comment with foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin stating that his country stand on the side of peace regarding ukraine while accusing the nato head of smear and groundless speculation it is a known fact that nato country including the u are the biggest source of weaponry for the battlefield in ukraine yet they keep claiming that china may be supplying weapon to russia wang told reporter during a wednesday press briefing this is a familiar trick used and exposed soon after the ukraine crisis broke out the spokesman added that while nato claim to be a regional defensive alliance it ha frequently ignored others security concern and constantly sought to reach beyond it traditional defense zone official in washington and other western country have also alleged that china could soon boost assistance for russia with u secretary of state antony blinken recently warning such support would be a serious problem an unnamed european official reached by ap claimed to have unambiguous intelligence showing that beijing is considering supplying weapon but said it is unclear whether any decision had been made to date official have provided no evidence to support the allegation beijing ha refused to condemn moscow s military action in ukraine and continues to keep good tie with the russian federation last week chinese state councilor wang yi announced that the people s republic wa working on a peace proposal to end the conflict but the detail of the plan have yet to be revealed while wang visited the russian capital for a meeting with president vladimir putin on wednesday the proposal wa not discussed according to foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova read more china russia relationship a threat nato washington a year ago the united state did something extraordinary it released previously classified intelligence that exposed russia s plan to invade ukraine last week antony j blinken the secretary of state made a similar move when he warned china s top foreign policy official wang yi against providing weapon to russia in a previous era the warning might have remained private at least for some time but a new intelligence playbook honed just before and during the war in ukraine ha redefined how the united state u it classified knowledge to undercut russia and it partner the playbook is not just about naming and shaming russia and it ally it ha become a powerful tool in the united state arsenal to try to stymie the kremlin s offensive by exposing russia s military plan and in aligning support for kyiv s war effort in allied capital ahead of mr blinken s meeting with mr wang the united state disclosed to ally intelligence normally held in tight secrecy it included detail about the ammunition and other weaponry china wa considering providing russia then mr blinken shared the broad conclusion that china wa considering giving military support to russia publicly for the most part china ha been engaged in providing rhetorical political diplomatic support to russia but we have information that give u concern that they are considering providing lethal support to russia in the war against ukraine mr blinken told abc news and it wa important for me to share very clearly with wang yi that this would be a serious problem the disclosure by mr blinken wa driven at least in part by the u s belief that public warning and the declassification of additional intelligence about internal chinese deliberation could still deter beijing from delivering to russia weapon system to aid moscow s military campaign some american official insist that unlike iran or north korea country whose military support for russia ha been disclosed by u s official china care about it international reputation because of it trade tie with europe and the united state which north korea and iran do not have beijing may be le willing to risk sanction over weapon sale the effort to declassify intelligence to expose russia began just over a year ago when the biden administration wa trying to convince some skeptical ally in europe that russia wa poised to invade ukraine the administration s new intelligence sharing strategy did not stop the russian invasion but it succeeded in revealing russian plan and aligning major western power behind measure to isolate russia economically and diplomatically ufeffit s not a natural thing to share intelligence beyond a handful of our most trusted ally but we knew that this effort wa going to have to be broader and deeper than we had ever done before said jon finer the deputy national security adviser the shift toward disclosure is driven in part by lesson of the past and startling technological change that have made more information about wartime activity accessible than ever before something intelligence official say allows them to release more information without endangering secret source the strategy is also in part a product of past intelligence failure some failure most infamously over claim of weapon of mass destruction in iraq still color how european view american spy agency two decade later those doubt forced the united state and britain to share more about what they knew about russian capability and intention to try to stave off european skepticism now according to some diplomat when those two ally declassify and release intelligence it is more readily believed by ally in europe who were previously uncertain of u s and british intelligence on russia s war plan even though russia wa not deterred by the release of the intelligence information what wa achieved wa that everybody wa on the same sheet of music when the war started said kaupo rosin the director general of the estonian foreign intelligence service which ha also released declassified information the u s release of intelligence ha focused on various country support for russia s war in addition to the warning about china the white house disclosed plan for iranian trainer missile and drone to join the battlefield in ukraine and it shared information about north korean artillery ammunition going to resupply russia the disclosure laid the groundwork for new sanction by the u s and europe on iranian drone maker more information release are likely official said whenever russia is close to striking a deal for new weaponry in addition to calling out country who are considering supporting russia the united state plan to release information on moscow s battle plan and preparation much a official did in the month before the invasion the aim would be to call out russia s effort to step up or expand it offensive in the east or south of ukraine said u s official who spoke on the condition of anonymity such a disclosure which would take away the element of surprise could help ukraine prepare and galvanize a european response either through additional economic step or increased military assistance to ukraine still there are more limit now than a year ago ahead of the invasion the united state wa trying to prod ukraine to take the threat of invasion more seriously now ukraine is fighting with all it might and u s official say they want to make sure any disclosure of russian movement or operational plan aid ukraine s effort to defend itself not complicate them part of the reason the u s government can disclose moscow s war plan is because washington based think tank like the institute for the study of war or the russia study program at cna are scrutinizing various thread of information to examine russia s movement the surge of such open source information which includes image from commercial satellite a well a report from russian blogger social medium post analyzing weapon found in ukraine and other information ha enabled the intelligence community to make more disclosure official said many declassification have come when the intelligence community can find open source information that allows analyst to draw similar conclusion xa u s official say they are not aware of any sensitive source of information that have been lost a a result of the release at least so far in after russia seized crimea the obama administration took a more cautious approach when it came to sharing intelligence then about russian activity in the donbas region of ukraine with skeptical european ally a decision that some official came to see a a mistake because it made it easier for moscow to sow division in the west obviously biden administration official have learned from that firsthand experience that most of them had a part of the obama administration said evelyn farkas the top pentagon official for ukraine during the obama year you can t convince people to go along with your policy if they are suspicious about what those policy are based on in the fall of many of the official who were involved in obama administration decision on intelligence sharing were back in power and they faced a similar dilemma at first they were somewhat unconvinced of the dire prediction of u s intelligence agency about a possible russian invasion but a they were presented with more evidence jake sullivan who served a mr biden s national security adviser when he wa vice president and mr finer his deputy came to the conclusion that the biden administration should not allow a repeat of and needed to find a way to prevent russia from dividing the west and catching the world by surprise mr biden agreed and directed that u s intelligence about russia s war plan be declassified so it could be shared with a broad group of ally he turned to u in the intelligence community and said you ve got to share avril d haines the director of national intelligence recalled in a speech last week you have to get out there and start sharing because we ve got to help them see what you re seeing in contrast to when u s official were largely caught off guard by russia s lightning seizure of crimea intelligence agency saw the invasion coming a a result biden administration official knew they had week if not month to lay the groundwork with reluctant ally and to pre empt moscow by exposing it plan there were really strong argument for going one step further and actually downgrading and declassifying some information so that we can also start to prepare the public landscape mr finer said u s intelligence agency are generally reluctant to share their secret but they agreed to do so after taking step to ensure that the disclosure would not expose their most valuable source the new playbook appears to be here to stay biden administration official say they will continue to disclose sensitive information when it is in america s strategic interest but that doe not mean the administration and intelligence official will always agree on what to release in a talk at the munich security conference william j burn the c i a director said the decision to release intelligence had an important impact on the course of the war but he said intelligence should be released only after an evaluation of the potential benefit and risk of each disclosure a i ve learned over many year the surest way to lose source of good intelligence is to be reckless in your handling of them mr burn said there s always a temptation to think that anything worth doing is worth overdoing so in this case i think we have to be careful and case by case on tuesday yevgeny prigozhin went further than he ever had in his public standoff with russia s military leader claiming the defense minister and the country s most senior general were starving his private army of ammunition he then accused them of treason for weakening his fighter at a crucial moment in the war in ukraine by thursday the acrimonious and very public dispute appeared to have subsided with mr prigozhin saying his mercenary group wagner now had the ammunition they desperately needed in the opaque world of the russian military it is impossible to know if his troop got the ammunition or if the kremlin lost patience and told him to play nice either way the discord between mr prigozhin and the russian defense ministry undermined the theme of unity emphasized by president vladimir v putin in highly publicized speech this week a he rallied the nation for a long war it also raised new question about russia s ability to sustain a drawn out war against an increasingly well armed ukraine tension between mr prigozhin and russia s military command have been building for month getting ever more bitter a wagner became the central fighting force for the city of bakhmut in ukraine s east those tension escalated to a new level on tuesday when mr prigozhin in a series of caustic audio message claimed the military command wa deliberately withholding supply to undermine wagner the defense ministry picked up the gauntlet in a rare public response that evening the ministry denied the accusation and indirectly accused mr prigozhin of aiding the enemy by damaging the unity of russian force mr prigozhin then escalated the dispute further calling the ministry s response an attempt to hide their crime on wednesday he published a graphic video showing row of dozen of corp which he said were wagner fighter who died because of ammunition shortage the video could not be independently verified on thursday mr prigozhin lowered the tone a suddenly a he raised it claiming on telegram that the problem ha been solved we were told that the loading of ammunition ha begun he said referring to the warehouse from the guy thank you mr prigozhin s flurry of polemical often shocking social medium activity come a wagner and regular military unit are storming bakhmut from three side and trying to end one of the war s bloodiest and longest battle ukraine this month barred civilian from entering the city in what some military analyst interpreted a a prelude to withdrawal the ukrainian defender however have maintained stiff resistance forcing wagner to rely on costly frontal assault to inch it way toward the city center these assault continued this week even a mr prigozhin denounced ammunition shortage according to russian military blogger making it difficult to estimate the effect of whatever supply problem there were ammo hunger is clearly impacting the fighting both for wagnerites and ordinary serviceman said ruslan leviev a russian military analyst for the conflict intelligence team a group of analyst it is difficult to tell how serious that hunger is right now after operating for year in secrecy mr prigozhin stepped on the public scene last summer a the russian invasion of ukraine sputtered he skillfully used social medium an ecosystem of troll farm and online propaganda outlet to paint a picture of himself a a straight talking patriot who wa prepared to achieve russia s military objective at any cost in the process he presented himself a an antidote to russia s staff general and military bureaucrat who had failed to capture ukraine s capital he portrayed wagner a an effective tight knit force and his ally contrasted the group s advance on bakhmut with the failure of the russian army elsewhere the group gained strength a mr prigozhin began recruiting from russian prison a move that could have been made possible through the personal involvement of mr putin his longtime ally american official estimated in december that wagner had about fighter in ukraine including experienced volunteer and convict ukrainian official russian right activist and wagner defector said many former prisoner have since died in near suicidal attack meant to wear down ukrainian defense for month wagner affiliated social medium account have accused russia s senior military command of sapping their force strength through costly operational and planning mistake mr prigozhin had supported those accusation in oblique comment but in january his tone became increasingly direct and confrontational he accused the defense ministry of ignoring wagner s contribution to the capture of soledar a town north of bakhmut soon after he said the military establishment had prevented him from recruiting convict in an effort to destroy wagner s offensive potential prison activist say the defense ministry ha started directly enlisting in prison although there ha been no official confirmation of such recruiting some analyst said mr prigozhin ha turned russia s unpopular commander into target to boost his public profile a sign of his growing political ambition and that he ha suffered a backlash a other commander try to lessen his power others have attributed the tension to the usual rivalry for mr putin s favor among official and businessmen there s clearly jealousy at play said dmitri kuznets a military analyst for the independent russian news outlet meduza while the dispute appears to have subsided it put the spotlight on russian ammunition stock amid sign that the kremlin is making move for the biggest offensive since the initial invasion wave mr prigozhin s plea suggest that russia is struggling to produce enough shell to sustain military operation that have dragged on for longer than the government expected said one russian researcher close to the defense ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity to discus sensitive topic for the foreseeable future the country s only solution is to import them from nearby nation he said his assessment broadly echoed analysis by western military expert some pro war russian commentator said mr prigozhin s complaint show that wagner and other russian private military company or p m c s now have to ration scarce supply like regular army unit the problem is not that p m c s have stopped receiving ammunition but that they have started receiving them like everyone else aleksandr khodakovsky a pro russian paramilitary commander in ukraine wrote on telegram on wednesday kostenets bulgaria the job is straightforward dangerous and will soon be open to applicant filling a millimeter soviet style artillery shell with explosive xa that will turn it into a lethal projectile for the resident of kostenets a dying mountain town in western bulgaria it s a welcome opportunity despite the risk of death it mean more job at the terem ammunition plant on the outskirt of town the factory stopped making the millimeter shell in a the cold war came to a close but soon the assembly line will be running again xa russia s invasion of ukraine ha turned soviet era arm and ammunition into critically important mat riel a western nation seek to supply ukraine with the munition it need to foil moscow s assault xa and so in january year after the last millimeter shell left the terem plant the company recommissioned production small town in xa bulgaria xa with it large pro russian population xa might seem unlikely linchpin of ukraine s military effort but one year into the war despite an influx of sophisticated western arm the ukrainian military still relies primarily on weapon that fire soviet standard munition the united state and it nato ally don t produce those munition and the few country outside russia that do are mostly in the former soviet orbit that ha western country scrambling to find alternative source pouring million of dollar into workarounds that keep the transaction quiet and avoid political fallout and russian retaliation and that brings them to some of the more remote area of eastern europe like kostenets and the xa small xa town of sopot xa roughly mile to the northeast which is home to another state run arm factory representative from the u s embassy quietly attended the ribbon cutting last month for the new production line in kostenets which took place outside the plant xa a rundown low slung building xa in a corner of the town with the new job it s adding the plant could become one of kostenets s biggest employer this is a big deal for the town said deputy mayor margarita mincheva sopot too ha seen it fortune improve since the invasion it is home to vmz an arm company that employ much of the local work force on a recent friday the dull thud of explosion rattled window they were likely test of freshly made munition the town s mayor said over the year vmz ha been a main source of income for sopot s resident the mayor deyan doinov added probably there isn t a single family in town whose member haven t worked or are not working at the plant he said virtually we have no unemployment only those who do not want to work are jobless bulgaria ha historically close tie to moscow though it ha been part of the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization since the early s last summer revelation that bulgaria supplied weapon to ukraine despite a strong opposition toward arming kyiv ignited a furor in the country s politics bulgaria s projected arm export last year soared exceeding billion around five time the sale abroad in according to government estimate from data gathered in october but it is hardly the only country quietly contributing to ukraine s war effort luxembourg is supplying ukraine with arm that originate in the czech republic broker with cash from the united state are scouring factory in bosnia and herzegovina serbia and romania for shell and britain ha formed a secret task force to arm ukraine according to a document the new york time obtained and official familiar with the task force s work the importance of such source is growing a ukraine burn through ammunition at an unsustainable rate one that jens stoltenberg the nato secretary general said last week wa many time higher than our current rate of production this put our defense industry under strain he added in recent month ukraine xa ha fired between and artillery shell daily but would like to fire more so it can retake territory captured by russia at one point last summer russia wa firing a many a shell a day but that number ha dropped since then and russia too is suffering from an ammunition shortage the united state is boosting it own production of artillery shell sixfold to fill the gap but it mostly make ammunition for the nato standard howitzer it ha sent to ukraine once the invasion began last year ukraine and it ally xa started buying up soviet style arm wherever they could find them state owned ukrainian company asked broker in america and elsewhere for tank helicopter plane and mortar according to document obtained by the time would be supplier emerged from the recess of the global weapon trade to meet demand last june a czech arm seller offered ukraine ammunition and a dozen soviet model ground attack jet built between and for about million the document show both britain and the united state have financed deal using third party country and broker in case where manufacturing country don t want to be publicly identified a providing weapon to ukraine people familiar with the effort say the secret task force created by the british defense ministry focused on getting soviet style ammunition say people familiar with the effort a task that became harder a the war went on and big supplier ran out of stock last june britain made a deal with pakistan to buy artillery shell and rocket made by the government owned pakistan ordnance factory under the term of the deal britain would pay a romanian broker to buy the pakistani weapon document show the transaction s official paperwork said the weapon would be transferred from pakistan to britain with no mention of ukraine a document obtained by the time show the deal fell apart after the pakistani supplier wa unable to deliver the ammunition said marius rosu the export chief of the romanian broker romtehnica such problem are common in deal relying on broker and far flung manufacturer mr rosu said his company doe not send weapon to ukraine he said customer elsewhere may buy weapon from romtehnica and later send them to ukraine that is not our problem he said official from the government ministry that oversees pakistan ordnance did not respond to question about the proposed deal bureaucratic loophole and pa through arrangement give bulgarian official political cover while fueling ukraine s war effort though the cover is thinly veiled given that the war in ukraine is still raging where do we think that the shell are going to be exported to said lyuba a year old grocery store saleswoman in kostenets who declined to provide her last name it s not rocket science to figure out that it production is going to ukraine bulgaria s arm industry ha occupied a peculiar role since the waning day of the soviet union it provided arm to both side of the iran iraq war and to libya among other customer and after the soviet union fell it supplied rebel in angola and the tamil tiger in sri lanka even after bulgaria joined the european union and nato it arm industry continued pumping out soviet caliber ammunition that created opportunity after the united state sent troop to afghanistan and iraq american ally in those country used soviet era weapon and the united state bought ammunition from bulgaria to supply them after syria s civil war began in bulgarian munition appeared there likely part of the xa campaign to arm group fighting the syrian regime that put bulgaria at odds with russia which supported the government of president bashar al assad of syria russian assassin poisoned a bulgarian arm dealer in and since then a series of unexplained explosion have rocked bulgarian arm company lyuba the saleswoman said the presence of the terem arm factory which wa shaken by an accidental explosion in make kostenets a russian target we are ordinary people we will probably never know what exactly they are making there she said a fortuitously timed election helped ease the way for bulgaria to become a major supplier to ukraine xa in the fall of during russia s buildup to the invasion a new party took power and kiril petkov the xa harvard educated prime minister decided it wa a moment that bulgaria could turn away from russia and toward the west we wanted to be on the right side of history he said in an interview this month mr petkov s governing coalition included an historically russia friendly party that balked at sending arm to ukraine so they came up with a workaround that would let bulgaria deny officially that it wa arming ukraine the government would approve export to other european union country including poland once there the weapon could travel to ukraine without bulgaria being involved sale picked up and factory boosted their output bulgarian ammunition soon accounted for one third of ukraine s supply mr petkov said mr petkov s government fell a few month later when another party left his coalition but by then there wa enough momentum that export continued even a other politician in bulgaria criticized the decision to help fight russia across the jagged snow covered mountain in sopot resident who worked there said vmz ha increased production since russia invaded ukraine and the plant now run from monday through saturday vmz ha been and is an integral part of the town s life said a year old employee who ha been working there for more than four decade and who declined to provide his name for fear of retribution after all that time he said his body still tense up on day the company test explosive and like vmz whether the people of sopot decide to acknowledge it or not the war in ukraine ha become a part of their day to day life it s going to sound cynical if i tell you that i want peace he said solemnly but at the same time i work at an arm factory it wa exactly a year ago and the ukrainian pet food maker kormotech had concluded it annual meeting the mood wa buoyant business wa booming the factory wa running and sale were projected to grow by double digit we had a beautiful budget rostyslav vovk the company s chief executive and founder recalled almost dreamily the next morning air siren sounded russia had invaded mr vovk called his top manager to meet at a nearby hotel avoiding the company s windowed seventh floor headquarters in lviv they had a plan for what had been considered a very unlikely risk russian aggression but it soon proved wholly inadequate we were not ready mr vovk said he closed the plant raw material couldn t get into the country and delivery headed abroad couldn t get out staff from the besieged eastern part of the country needed to be evacuated employee were joining the military and the company s biggest export market belarus wa a close ally of vladimir v putin the russian president we would make decision mr vovk said of that first week after the invasion and then the next morning we would change all the information like leader at ten of thousand of company throughout ukraine mr vovk and his team were suddenly confronted with a new and bewildering responsibility keeping a business going through the chaos and danger of war for many the task ha proved impossible before the war ukraine s private sector including it huge steel and agricultural industry accounted for percent of the country s gross domestic product said elena voloshina head of the international finance corporation in ukraine eighty three percent of business experienced loss related to the war she said forty percent suffered direct damage like a factory or store decimated by a missile while percent were in what is now occupied territory last year ukraine s overall output plunged by nearly a third wrecking the country s economy and hampering it ability to battle russian force kormotech a family owned business with employee worldwide doe not produce weapon or drone it isn t involved in supplying critically needed electricity transport or fresh water to ravaged city but it employ people produce income earns foreign currency from export and contributes tax revenue that the government in kyiv desperately need to pay soldier repair power line and buy medical equipment a year later mr vovk and his management team have found reason to again celebrate mr vovk wa back in his office getting ready for the latest annual meeting with his staff and some of their dog which are fixture around the office and often serve a product taste tester despite the odds business grew more than expected kormotech had a few thing going for it the company s plant wa outside lviv in the westernmost part of the country near the polish border one of the safest part of ukraine the two factory in prylbychi were able to reopen le than two week after the war began an earlier decision to start an additional factory in lithuania which opened in and wa operating around the clock turned out to be a boon it could continue smoothly producing and delivering ton of kormotech s club paw optimeal miau and gav brand after a helter skelter start mr vovk and his top manager reorganized the company which sell it product in country including the united state and europe had a little wiggle room because they had avoided just in time practice that eliminated backup inventory a cost cutting approach that had stymied so many company worldwide during the pandemic kormotech routinely kept stock in it warehouse at least a month and a half s worth in ukraine two month in other country in europe and two and a half in the united state still kormotech s supply chain wa disrupted before the war roughly half it raw material like meat and chicken meal came from abroad now border crossing delay and rising import price had prompted a search for domestic producer it found two that had never produced pet meal before and taught them what to do kateryna kovaliuk kormotech s chief reputation officer emphasized that pet food standard could often be more exacting than food produced for people during a recent tour of the lviv plant she picked up a few kibble size bit chopped up from long ropelike strand of cat food fresh off the production line try it she urged before popping a couple of piece in her mouth and smiling it s good it taste like meat without salt a it turned out the local producer le than mile from the plant were not only cheaper but also didn t have to be paid in precious foreign currency instead of buying ton of meal from abroad the company now buy ton kormotech stepped up it purchase of ukrainian grain and corn a well the war and russian blockade caused a drastic drop in grain export spiraling food price and a global hunger crisis but it also meant that domestic business like kormotech could buy at a discount manufacturing the product wa one hurdle getting it delivered abroad wa another at a time when ukraine ha barred men under from leaving the country the trade ministry provided exemption for delivery driver but the wait at the border could extend from a few day to a few week and with seaport mostly blocked exporting remained an expensive and tricky problem no one knew where to go or how mr vovk said the first truck sent to azerbaijan he said cost more than before the war it wa roughly domestic demand for it product stayed steady but finding new export market wa another challenge belarus which ha allowed russia to stage attack from inside it border represented percent of kormotech s export market the management team decided to pull out but needed to replace those customer supermarket chain particularly in the baltic country and poland were eager to step in and replace russian made good with ukrainian one for the first time in my life made in ukraine wa a premium mr vovk said previously when the company appeared at international pet supply exhibition he said with a laugh people were so unfamiliar with the country s product they would ask if the letter u and k referred to the u k for the united kingdom even so good will extended only so far buyer wanted assurance that kormotech s product would keep flowing so the company provided guarantee setting up a warehouse in poland with backup stock of it different product outsourcing some production to facility in germany and poland and drawing up last resort plan to move production out of ukraine the enormous growth in both the european and american market mean that the company s sale are expected to increase to million this year from million the main obstacle to expanding even more is capacity kormotech scrapped plan for a new million euro factory because of uncertainty and the difficulty in getting financing but it invested million million in the prylbychi plant and million million in lithuania of course many business have not been a successful a kormotech either because their facility were damaged or demand for their product wa eviscerated when people fled the country a well a by ravenous inflation and shrunken income mr vovk said the exodus of million of mother and child had left a friend s diaper manufacturing business in tatter a new report from the american chamber of commerce in ukraine and mckinsey company found that only percent of company grew last year while nearly half saw a decline in sale others have adapted by relocating to place like lviv or changing their output to fill new wartime demand like the lingerie seamstress who have switched to sewing cloth vest to fit body armor plate ukraine s large and mobile information technology sector ha also remained strong business are still struggling to adapt russian attack on ukraine s power grid compelled kormotech to buy two generator at apiece supersize version of the small colorful unit that noisily hum outside nearly every shop and cafe on lviv s street now the russian are stepping up missile strike on a recent weekday air raid alert caused plant worker to spend more than half of their hour shift in a tunnel like storage area about three pace wide that double a a bomb shelter vira protsyk who normally would be packing box sat on one of the wooden bench that lined the foot long wall it s a bit boring she said of the forced break this wa the second alert of the day i didn t want to go to the shelter i d rather work just the other day u president joseph biden spoke in the favorite style of goebbels propaganda politruk is lying it s good in our captivity surrender we are not your enemy the latter sounded literally verbatim i want to once again appeal to the people of russia the u s and european country do not seek to control or destroy russia the west did not plan to attack russia and million of russian citizen who just want to live in peace with their neighbor are not enemy to u the west said joseph biden tempting to be honest not really because we hear these incantation from time to time all these year and the action and deed of western politician are at odds with these word however this wa the case before and now in the same west they no longer hide the fact that they are not satisfied with the whole of russia totally they threw away the norm of morality and decency they seriously believe that our fellow citizen do not have access to modern mean of mass communication and we will dutifully be content with the chewing gum that they share with u in a wide public space and we will not know what they say in their interlocutor probably for the reason that they really believe that we have the internet here on coupon and we celebrate holiday with a bottle of vodka and ezhatin on coupon and only representative of the russian elite have toilet and now estonian prime minister kaja kallas at the munich international security conference declares that after the victory of the north atlantic alliance in ukraine the mentality of the russian should be forcibly rewritten with the help of technique and methodology that have long been worked out in the baltic state and then she called for an analogue of the nuremberg tribunal over russia about the trial of estonia which wa the first in europe to report to berlin that it wa completely cleansed of jew kaya did not say a word still now estonian historian claim that jew in estonia were killed without hatred however let s go back to today here for example is the former foreign minister of ukraine volodymyr ohryzko after biden s speech with the word we are not enemy or you are not enemy ohryzko state in plain text the reason is not in putin but in the russian people who want to have their own putin and this happens again and again such a country must be finished it ha no right to exist because it is a threat to the entire normal civilized world that s the rationale for destroying our country and this is only part of the nonsense that ohryzko carried on the air of ukrainian radio adjusting radio listener accordingly and don t say it s a former the current melnik kuleba deshitsa vrublevsky and their ilk are no le bloodthirsty and they say much the same thing about the need to destroy a many russian a possible polish official do not hesitate in their expression and dream about the destruction of russia and the russian previous legislation only gave jurisdiction if a u s citizen wa a victim or criminal in the event that this crime wa committed by a russian criminal against a ukrainian civilian we would have no mean to prosecute the criminal we would have to look for other way said on the air of the channel voice of america ambassador for global criminal justice of the u state department beth van skaak and explained how the u changed the legislation precisely to solve such problem now the ministry of justice ha created a team to prosecute war crime and they focused on war crime in ukraine we will have to wait for russian criminal to come to the united state for some reason and then we will be able to use the new legal power translated into normal language a soon a some russian who we do not like to set foot on american soil we will immediately accuse him of crime against ukraine and hide him behind bar this is after biden spoke a senior state department official say they are preparing for the russian what about biden s speech in warsaw on this occasion all the explanation were also given by the former minister of external affair pavlo klimkin who explained that biden wa not really addressing the russian people but to that part of the russian elite that is corrupt in western terminology it is negotiable in order to reboot russia in a controlled manner with it participation in the parameter necessary for the west russia s controlled reset mean that part of the elite perhaps some russian oligarch or others will have to be talked to and i am sure that this conversation is already underway klimkin also assured on the radio and after all these speech they still have the audacity to call russia a xenophobic state listen a well the west dream of ending russia with the hand of ukraine more romanian president klaus iohannis discussed energy economic and security issue in bucharest thursday with his visiting moldovan counterpart a the two neighbor seek to boost tie amid russia s war in ukraine iohannis office said the talk with moldovan president maia sandu would aim to bring her country closer to the nation european union to which romania belongs moldova is going through unprecedented challenge sandu said adding that over the past year her country ha faced security challenge aimed at creating chaos and destabilizing our region both country border on ukraine sandu s visit came a week after she claimed moscow wa allegedly plotting to overthrow moldova s government put the nation at the disposal of russia and derail it aspiration to join the eu russia strongly denied her claim over the past year moldova a former soviet republic of about million people ha sought closer tie with it western partner last june it wa granted eu candidate status the same day a ukraine since russia invaded ukraine a year ago moldova ha faced a string of crisis these include severe energy problem after moscow dramatically reduced gas supply rocketing inflation several missile that have traversed it sky from the fighting next door and a huge inflow of war refugee on thursday russia s defense ministry claimed without evidence that ukraine is planning an armed provocation against moldova s moscow backed breakaway region of transnistria russia maintains about peacekeeping troop in the region which is internationally recognized a part of moldova russian president vladimir putin gifted president biden a pen and writing set when the pair met for the first time since biden gained office according to a new state department disclosure putin made the gift in when both leader met at a presidential summit in geneva the white house stated at the time that biden had given putin a pair of aviator sunglass but it did not disclose putin s lavish gift to the president state department record say the gift wa given to the national archive for safekeeping a common destination for presidential gift the white house did not respond to a request for comment from fox news digital regarding why it hadn t previously disclosed putin s gift the state department release first reported by bloomberg news describes the gift a a kholuy lacquer miniature workshop desk writing set and pen and listed an estimated value of meanwhile biden s glass had a value of a few hundred dollar the june summit came just eight month before putin would invade ukraine dashing hope of improved relation between the u s and russia the pen set will likely end up in biden s presidential library after he leaf office gift granted to u s president are considered to be the property of the u s government not the individual office holder official must purchase the item for the estimated price in order to own and use them after leaving office gift giving among world leader is an extremely common practice but putin s writing set wa by far the most expensive gift listed in the state department s disclosure for instance french president emmanuel macron also gave biden a pen but it wa worth just the late queen of england gave biden a photo of herself in a silver frame valued at anders hagstrom is a reporter with fox news digital covering national politics and major breaking news event send tip to anders hagstrom fox com or on twitter hagstrom anders secretary of state antony blinken during a lengthy interview about russia a year after the invasion of ukraine took a moment to insist that when it come to how the united state handle the situation president biden is the one calling the shot blinken wa in the middle of discussing how biden want to continue supporting ukraine but doe not want to broaden the war then made it clear that it is indeed up to biden the statement came at a time when it remains a question whether biden will seek re election in member of both party have expressed concern about the president s ability to win and serve a second term a he recently turned blinken also heaped praise on ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy during the interview lauding him for how he ha handled the russian invasion going back to when blinken first warned him that he believed an invasion wa coming blinken also addressed the nature of the situation between russia and the u s fielding a question of whether it is cold war like in nature the secretary noted that the current conflict is not ideologically based in term of communism versus capitalism director of the office of the central commission for foreign affair wang yi traveled to moscow this week meeting with top level russian official including foreign minister sergey lavrov security council secretary nikolai patrushev and putin himself chinese official maintained a vague public attitude toward the russian invasion of ukraine both attesting to their continued friendship with russia and refusing to elaborate on what form of aid it is willing to provide to it ally fox news greg norman contributed to this report i would say no one come out the winner here craig singleton from the foundation for defense of democracy told fox news digital it s difficult for me to see a scenario where there are any winner here he said putin reportedly believed that the entire operation would take only a few day and joint chief of staff gen mark milley echoed that sentiment a one of five possible outcome if russia launched an invasion of ukraine saying that kyiv could fall in a little a hour that defense ha come at significant cost which russia expert rebekah koffler highlighted a a major concern moving forward regardless of the conflict s outcome koffler also argued that ukraine is a clear loser due to it staggering loss in industrial and agricultural base devastated energy infrastructure and the slow slide away from true independence ukraine is going to permanently depend on the west for it gross domestic product with the u s leading the rest of the country with billion in total military financial and humanitarian aid koffler said koffler picked out only one clear winner from the conflict china which ha seen it two biggest powerhouse competitor severely depleted through the conflict a well a having some kind of preview of how the west might react to a taiwan invasion scenario he also acknowledged that regardless of the outcome russia remains vulnerable to chinese predation and could end up a vassal but the relatively unproductive economy in russia would make it more of a problem for beijing china will be eager to take advantage of opportunity to negotiate cheap secure supply of energy to meet it insatiable demand for energy resource but at the same time if the chinese are perceived to have to keep russia afloat that is likely i think to exacerbate existing tension between the two country singleton said estonian minister of foreign affair urmas reinsalu told fox news digital in an exclusive interview that there would be tectonic difference in europe s power balance after the war especially if russia faced total failure reinsalu called the outcome of the war decisive not only for ukrainian but for many other country he also stressed the need for a tribunal to investigate russia for alleged war crime which ukraine claim to have documented at least russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that he will strengthen russia s nuclear force announcing that his military is prepared to deploy a new intercontinental ballistic missile system with hypersonic missile and new nuclear submarine on tuesday putin announced that russia would suspend it participation in the new start treaty which cap the number of nuclear armament each country can

embarrassing decision are in fact his death throe it s sad really unfortunately what happens to men also tends to happen to the system they create for the last year our world ha been governed by a system formed in the final month of world war ii it feature define our life free and open global trade route guaranteed by the u s navy a universal currency called the dollar and overseeing it all one supreme power the world s largest economy the united state of america we re going to tell them what the rule are once they hear the rule they ll obey janet yellen seems shocked and outraged that china ha decided to align with vladimir putin in the war in ukraine it s an outrage it s unbelievable who could have seen this coming well almost everybody actually it wa obvious to the world it wa going to happen because it wa always going to happen if we didn t force a peace in ukraine the faa got billion in the last budget billion so given that plane seem to be coming very close to hitting each other lately it might be worth funding the faa a little more oh but no zelenskyy s political party need it this information bomb which ha become the main military sensation of recent day sounded in vladimir putin s address russia stop it participation in the treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive arm start why wa this decision made and what it can lead to let s find out the first start treaty wa signed by mikhail gorbachev and george w bush in july three week before the gkchp putsch now between russia and the united state there is already a third version of the treaty start it wa signed in by dmitry medvedev and barack obama the contract wa designed for year with the possibility of extension for another year and it wa really extended until february start provides for a reduction for each of the party of the deployed nuclear warhead to and intercontinental ballistic missile including submarine and heavy bomber up to unit it is clear that each missile can have several warhead that separate upon approach and hit many target at once according to the u inspection russia ha missile and they have deployed warhead the united state according to russian inspector had missile and deployed warhead a we can see both country have reduced their nuclear missile force even below the bar of the treaty but a slight superiority wa and still is in the united state putin in his address mentioned that the treaty should take into account nuclear weapon not only of the united state but also of other nato country namely france and britain why because in the event of a conflict with russia london and paris will unfurl their missile at the first snap of their finger from washington according to the stockholm peace institute france today ha missile and warhead britain ha missile and warhead if we sum up the nuclear potential of the united state france and great britain then a we see they are already seriously superior to the russian one moreover britain and france do not just posse nuclear weapon but they are also aimed at russia all this grossly violates the principle of equal security written in the same start treaty but this issue raised by moscow the american have so far repeatedly left out of bracket from the very beginning of start the american tried to chemicalize for example our inspector were not allowed to fully test nuclear missile on nuclear submarine like and a partial inspection is enough then they refused to inspect the russian those nuclear facility that were declared which contradicted the provision of the treaty in the end these mockery bothered the specialist in the ministry of defense of the russian federation and in the ministry of foreign affair an interesting detail after the extension of start the united state never allowed u to visit u with a nuclear inspection there wa information that the state of their mine based nuclear force wa deplorable i think that s the reason why we weren t allowed in apparently they didn t want u to find out that they weren t a rosy a they claimed on the other hand the united state quietly continued to increase the number of both missile and warhead by the end of they had carrier and warhead to all the claim of the russian side in this regard they only shrugged their hand they were also cunning in another way no matter how hard our expert fought they could not convince the american that it wa unfair to count one heavy bomber for one nuclear charge in the treaty after all in fact one board can carry up to missile or bomb the united state ha more heavy bomber than russia and the real ratio of charge thus wa for russia and about for the united state but that s not all by february the treaty s target date russia had fully fulfilled it obligation to reduce it nuclear force the american on the other hand went to trick unilaterally excluded from the offset launcher from the submarine trident ii and bomber b n why the u s said it had refurbished them in addition they called several mine training and also did not include them in the test the result the united state exceeded the number of nuclear carrier allowed by the treaty by unit and now even more after moscow repeatedly raised the issue of extending start but the white house tried to reform it in it favor demanding that russia include all it latest hypersonic missile in the treaty this would deprive russia of the opportunity to counter the nuclear advantage of the united state coupled with france and britain another important point here is that the united state and nato are openly acting against u in ukraine today they say out loud that their goal is the defeat of russia and at the same time they want our nuclear facility control found simpleton in his address putin said some figure in washington we know for sure are already thinking about natural test of their nuclear weapon taking into account the fact that the united state is developing new type of nuclear weapon such information is available indeed in recent year the united state ha been actively developing low yield nuclear charge they want to adapt them to hypersonic system which the american are also urgently doing trying to catch up with russia in this the main task is that such a missile should reach the territory of russia a soon a possible bypassing our missile defense system they already have a project of a stage missile that accelerated the warhead so that it reached the target at a speed of time faster than sound destroying it with a direct blow now they are working on this project but theory is one thing and practice is another it is important for the american to understand what the real effect will be from the explosion of such a warhead which in flight scald with a frenzied temperature up to thousand degree the united state is also creating superweapons against russia s nuclear arsenal according to their idea it will be able to hit most of our nuclear potential even before moscow make a decision on a counter strike that is we see attempt by the american to develop a nuclear war scheme that would allow them to be the first to launch massive strike against russia without fear of retaliation in this situation putin said in his address the ministry of defense and rosatom must ensure readiness for the testing of russian nuclear weapon we will not be the first to do this but if the united state conduct a test then we will do it very possibly there wa a hint of completely new and high precision nuclear weapon of various capacity now that the u s say it goal is to inflict a strategic defeat on russia and other nuclear armed nato country have joined those threat our continued adherence to start with the admission of u s inspector to our nuclear facility make no sense under these condition russia simply untied it hand and here the question arises is there a danger that the world is moving to a new round of the nuclear race expert say it is not russia that set these impulse for the transition to a new state of the world order it is not we who are destroying nuclear parity the u s is doing it putin also mentioned this in his address we can assume that this is about our newest strategic silo based missile system of the th generation sarmat the orbital bombardment technology embedded in this missile make it possible to strike at the enemy s territory along a suborbital trajectory through the south pole of the earth bypassing the deployed american thaad anti missile battery the avangard yu guided warhead used in this product are unparalleled in the world listen a well the west is ready to spend all the money of the world on the destruction of russia more moscow it wa one of the biggest public celebration of the war that russia ha seen since the full scale invasion of ukraine an overflow crowd at the country s largest stadium cheering image of destruction and song about spilling blood and conquering ukraine formally the event wa tied to russia s annual defender of the fatherland holiday honoring veteran but coming two day before the anniversary of the invasion it served a a televised show of popular support for the war the armed force waging it and the man behind it president vladimir v putin i love it said aleksandr xa a lawyer from moscow who wa waving a flag high up in the stand while a performer xa rapped about the ukrainian territory mr putin claimed to have annexed last year i don t understand how can i not support it he said of a war that the kremlin forbids people to call a war referring to it a a special military operation the highly choreographed concert and rally romanticized russia s military and the war while performer sang the screen throughout the stadium did not show them but instead played video of soldier fighting and firing heavy weapon and destroyed building next to the entrance to the stadium volunteer sewed camouflage net in uniform first lt nikolai romanenko performed a rap remix featuring the popular world war ii song katyusha with updated lyric including i m not afraid to stain my hand in blood up to the elbow another person performed a rap ballad about demon buried in azovstal the ukrainian fighter who held out for week in a steel plant in mariupol including lyric in ukrainian with a video mocking the ukrainian woman who pleaded for the evacuation of their husband son and brother grigory leps one of russia s best known pop singer sang a song fusing the second world war recruitment slogan homeland mother is calling with the contemporary pro war refrain we don t abandon our own in all the celebration at luzhniki stadium reflected the kremlin s campaign to normalize the war for the russian populace a tacit recognition that it will not end any time soon the event even featured some acknowledgment of russian casualty though not their enormous scale they re trying to militarize the whole society said grigory b yudin a political philosophy professor at the moscow school of social and economic science who did not attend the event ticket were free distributed mostly to state employee and student who were given the day off from work or study and provided with round trip transportation matvey a university student from the city of tambov said several bus from two university there had traveled more than eight hour each way to the concert several attendee from the moscow region said they had been encouraged by their employer to go people were bused there forced to attend we have report of that from multiple university said professor yudin putin coerces people lure them into participating and these student are promised free pas on exam he continued he want both the total mobilization of the country and the total passivity a total acceptance an approach he described a schizophrenic the seat stadium appeared more than full despite temperature far below freezing with people in the aisle and on the field and thousand more on the ground outside and for many of them at least those willing to speak with an american journalist the enthusiasm seemed genuine even if they have been touched by the war s loss i support it yes because it wa high time to start this katya who work for an aesthetic medicine clinic in the moscow region said of the war she cited what she called the suffering of many friend from the donetsk region of ukraine where moscow s separatist proxy began fighting kyiv eight year before xa russia s full scale invasion last year but katya admitted that she wished the war had ended already and said one of her university classmate had been killed it is a sensitive topic any criticism of the war can result in a prison sentence and she like some others interviewed declined to give her surname i don t understand why it s become so drawn out she said it s a pity everyone in their family already ha at least some acquaintance who died despite her support for the war she voiced some surprise at the enthusiasm around her on wednesday tacitly acknowledging how artificial such public display can be what impressed me the most wa that i could see people were genuinely coming not coerced she said i also came here willingly myself her husband stanislav had received ticket to the event from his job and said he wa glad he had come it wa very emotional he said concert m c s shared story about some of the russian soldier fighting and falling in ukraine and invited their relative onstage the kremlin ha not conceded the scale of russian casualty about killed or wounded western official say and ha generally avoided releasing the name of the dead boris i lugin spoke of his son anatoly s death in battle our task is to do everything to win every beat of our heart for victory every beat he told the crowd this is how i live my life a soldier s father a child s choir sang a song greeting soldier written a a message to troop at the front in the mold of the letter russian schoolchildren have been asked to write a homework another group of child from occupied mariupol were brought to the stage along with a soldier named yuri l gagarin code name angel who wa introduced a having saved child from the devastated city though how he did so wa not explained a image of the destruction played on the screen without addressing the russian bombardment that had leveled much of the city small child onstage covered their ear ukraine and right group say that russia ha stolen thousand of child from occupied territory and ha killed countless civilian in mariupol and elsewhere but no one onstage asked about these child s parent one m c encouraged the child to hug mr gagarin who wa decorated with an order of courage for his army service in thanks these are our child and we the russian army must protect these people and these child said mr gagarin whose name echo that of the first person in space yuri a gagarin a hero to many russian we are a strong army we are a powerful army but your support is important to u we re together we re going to win it wa the same message delivered by every speaker at the event social unity and support for the troop from all stratum of society are essential mr putin made a brief appearance acknowledging the dissonance that people were gathered for a festive event while soldier were fighting and dying and encouraged all russian to join the war effort even child who write letter to our fighter at the front are very important he said all our people are defender of the fatherland anna vasilyevna who had come to the concert from xa solnechnogorsk mile from moscow said her father died fighting in world war ii she completely supported mr putin because now everything is the same a it wa back then she said echoing the kremlin s propaganda equating russia s invasion of ukraine with soviet fighting nazi a she left the stadium she passed an exhibit of hero and act of bravery on one side of the panel were hero from world war ii on another picture and description of those who died invading ukraine and now we have the same hero she said kyiv ukraine a ukrainian force battle russian attack along the mile front line and warn of an imminent large scale missile bombardment kyiv is also casting an anxious eye on russian threat via belarus and moldova that official say pose minimal immediate risk but cannot be ignored while military analyst have expressed doubt about russia s ability to open and sustain a new front in the war ukrainian and western official have warned that moscow could try and divert ukrainian resource through feint and deception which could come from anywhere this week ukraine deployed more troop to it border with moldova and the ukrainian military ha in recent month increased military drill near it border with belarus and in the ukrainian capital kyiv ukrainian official and military analyst have said that there is no evidence suggesting russian force are planning a ground assault from belarus a steadfast kremlin ally that share a mile border with ukraine but military activity there ha been a constant source of concern the country s president who met with president vladimir v putin of russia last week allowed russian force to use belarus a a staging ground for the invasion and moscow u the country a a site to train soldier and ferry supply ukrainian official are also grappling with what they say are russian effort to engulf moldova in the war wedged between romania and ukraine moldova is one of europe s poorest nation and is riven by a russia supported breakaway republic transnistria in the spring before moscow suffered a string of humiliating battlefield defeat a russian general suggested that moscow s troop might charge up the black sea coast to rescue what he called oppressed transnistrians and this month president volodymyr zelensky said ukraine had intercepted a detailed russian plan to destroy the political situation in moldova that country s pro western president maia sandu said the plot for which she offered no evidence involved foreign actor with military background camouflaged in civilian clothes to undertake violent action attack on state institution and taking hostage moldova s pro russian opposition politician and others have tried to capitalize on economic discontent in the country by stirring weekly protest demanding m sandu s resignation sometimes paying them to attend the main thrust of moscow s offensive operation remain in eastern and southern ukraine where russian force are trying to break through ukrainian defense in five direction though it ha so far failed to score a breakthrough despite all the pressure on our force the front line ha not changed mr zelensky said in a late night address on tuesday washington president biden and his top official vowed this week to introduce additional sanction aimed at impeding russia s war effort against ukraine but the administration s focus is increasingly shifting to the role that china ha played in supplying russia with good that have both civilian and military u a one of the world s biggest manufacturer of product like electronics drone and vehicle part china ha proved to be a particularly crucial economic partner for russia beijing ha remained officially unaligned in the war yet china along with country like turkey and some former soviet republic ha stepped in to supply russia with large volume of product that either civilian or armed force could use including raw material smartphones vehicle and computer chip trade data show administration official are now expressing concern that china could further aid russia s incursion by providing moscow with lethal weapon while there is no clear evidence that china ha given weapon and ammunition to russia secretary of state antony j blinken warned in recent day that china may be preparing to do so president biden speaking in kyiv on monday said the united state and it partner would announce new measure targeting sanction evasion this week he did not specify whether those action would be directed at moscow or it trading partner together we have made sure that russia is paying the price for it abuse he said xa the next day in warsaw and in a speech on xa tuesday at the council on foreign relation wally adeyemo the deputy treasury xa secretary said xa the united state would be working to identify and shut down the specific channel through which russia attempt to equip and fund it military our counterevasion effort will deny russia access to the dual use good being used for the war and cut off these repurposed manufacturing facility from the input needed to fill russia s production gap he said the comment came on the same day that wang yi china s top diplomat visited moscow the action that the united state ha taken against russia in partnership with more than country constitute the broadest set of sanction and export control ever imposed against a major economy but this regime still ha it limit one year into the war the russian economy is stagnant but not crippled the country ha lost direct access to coveted western consumer brand and import of the most advanced technology like semiconductor but individual and company around the world have stepped in to provide russia with black market version of these same product or cheaper alternative made in china or other country good appear to be finding their way to russia just through a longer route export from european country to country like armenia azerbaijan belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan have exploded a have export from those country to russia according to matthew klein an economics writer who is tracking trend in trade volume both this data and russian tax collection suggest that the country s overall import have essentially recovered to pre war level he said in particular the united state and it ally appear to have had limited success in stopping the trade of so called dual use technology that can be used in both military equipment and consumer good the united state included many type of dual use good in the export control it issued against russia last february because the good can be repurposed for military u aircraft part that civilian airline can use for example may be repurposed by the russian air force while semiconductor in washing machine and electronics might be used for tank or other weaponry top u s official warned their chinese counterpart against supporting russia s war effort after the invasion of ukraine last year saying there would be firm consequence while china ha been careful not to cross that line it ha provided support for russia in other way including through active trade in certain good the united state ha cracked down on some of the company and organization providing good and service to russia in january it imposed sanction on a chinese company that had provided satellite imagery to the wagner mercenary group which ha played a large role in the battle for eastern ukraine in december it added two chinese research institute to a list of entity that supply the russian military which will restrict their access to u s technology but tracking by research firm show that trade in good that the russian military effort can use ha flourished according to the observatory of economic complexity an online data platform shipment from china to russia of aluminum oxide a metal that can be used in armored vehicle personal protective equipment and ballistic shield soared by more than xa time from to shipment of mineral and chemical used in the production of missile casing bullet explosive and propellant have also increased according to the observatory of economic complexity and china shipped million worth of drone and million worth of certain aircraft and spacecraft part to russia last year up from zero the prior year according to the group s data data from silverado policy accelerator a washington nonprofit show that russian import of integrated circuit or chip which are crucial in rebuilding tank aircraft communication device and weaponry plummeted immediately after the invasion but crept up over the past year in december russia s import of chip had recovered to more than two third of their value last february just before the war began according to silverado china and hong kong in particular together accounted for nearly percent of global chip export to russia by value from march to december shipment from china to russia of smart card light emitting diode polysilicon semiconductor manufacturing equipment and other good have also risen the firm said relation between the united state and china have soured in recent week after the flight of a chinese surveillance balloon across the united state early this month but division over russia are further straining geopolitical tie a meeting between mr blinken and mr wang his chinese counterpart on the sideline of the munich security conference on saturday night wa particularly tense u s official have been sharing information on china s activity with ally and partner in their meeting in munich a person familiar with the matter said on face the nation on sunday mr blinken said he had shared concern with mr wang that china wa considering providing weapon and ammunition to aid russia s campaign in ukraine and that such an action would have serious consequence for the u s chinese relationship to date we have seen chinese company and of course in china there s really no distinction between private company and the state we have seen them provide nonlethal support to russia for use in ukraine mr blinken said the concern that we have now is based on information we have that they re considering providing lethal support he added and we ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for u and in our relationship u s official have emphasized that china by itself is limited in it ability to supply russia with all the good it need china doe not produce the most advanced type of semiconductor for example and restriction imposed by the united state in october will prevent beijing from buying some of the most advanced type of chip and the equipment used to make them from other part of the world russia is unable to produce precision missile today because the country no longer ha access to leading edge semiconductor made by the united state taiwan south korea and other allied source a senior administration official said xa on monday while we are concerned about russia s deepening tie with them beijing cannot give the kremlin what it doe not have because china doe not produce the advanced semiconductor russia need mr adeyemo said during his remark and nearly percent of the le advanced microchip russia is receiving from china are defective but ivan kanapathy a former china director for the national security council said that most of what russia needed for it weapon were le advanced chip which are manufactured in plenty in china the u s government is very well aware that our export control system is designed in a way that really relies on a cooperative host government which we don t have in this case mr kanapathy said he added that it wa quite easy for party to circumvent export control through the use of front company or by altering the name and address of entity china is quite adept at that slovakia s acting foreign minister rastislav kacer ha taken a swipe at hungarian prime minister viktor orban resorting to profanity to describe his reluctance to get involved in the ukraine conflict the remark riled up hungarian official with some recommending the minister seek mental health treatment on tuesday kacer published a lengthy post on facebook criticizing a recent speech by orban and claiming that he is the only western politician worried that supplying weapon and supporting ukraine only prolongs the war last week during his annual state of the nation address the hungarian premier claimed that by sending military aid to ukraine european country are drifting into the war with russia over the weekend the carpathian prophet spoke to them hungarian about how this is not our war it is only a military conflict between two slavic state the minister said describing orban s remark a pathetic and disgusting read more eu indirectly at war with russia orban stressing that slovakia is part of the developed world and the west kacer asserted that he doesn t want u to do it like orban and certainly not to be on russian president vladimir putin s side for putin s collaborator and for all those who want peace at the cost of the destruction of ukraine i have only one message he said adding an uncensored profanity in russian translated a go f yourself responding to the insult zsolt nemeth who chair the hungarian parliament s foreign affair committee said he is extremely concerned about kacer s mental health i advise you to see a psychiatrist very urgently he added meanwhile tamas menczer hungarian state secretary for foreign affair described kacer a a provocateur who must be treated accordingly since the start of the ukraine conflict almost one year ago hungary which is heavily dependent on russian energy ha repeatedly spoken against the sanction the west ha imposed on moscow it ha argued that the restriction have failed to meaningfully weaken russia while damaging the eu s economy budapest ha also refused to support kiev with weapon or allow arm transfer across it border with ukraine warsaw in a day of dueling effort to shore up allegiance president biden wrapped up a three day trip to europe wednesday with a promise of america s commitment to it ally a president vladimir v putin warmly welcomed china s top diplomat to moscow and rallied pro war russian with the anniversary of moscow s invasion of ukraine approaching mr biden met in warsaw with leader from nato s eastern flank acknowledging that you know better than anyone what s at stake in this conflict not just for ukraine but for the freedom of democracy throughout europe and around the world at around xa the same time mr putin xa told a boisterous crowd of ten of thousand at a stadium rally that there is a battle underway on our historical border for our people just after he tried to shore up his most important partnership in a meeting with the top chinese diplomat wang yi taken together the scene created the impression that the world is retreating into two bloc that bear similarity to those of the cold war this time many former eastern bloc country hungary is a notable exception are aligning with the west to oppose mr putin s aggression and china and russia dropping their many difference are conducting military exercise together and deepening their financial tie a each face western sanction but the reality is still more complicated many other power including india turkey and israel remain on the fence continuing to buy oil and gas from russia or to work with mr putin diplomatically while buying arm from the united state and remaining in it defense orbit that ha touched off a messy behind the scene effort by both side to win support for mr biden the question is whether the western ally have the wherewithal to continue arming and supporting the ukrainian government at the level needed to keep an emerging russian offensive at bay and to deter mr putin from once again seeking to take over the entire country for mr putin the doubt may be even greater even a he try to telegraph confidence and public support an offensive he began in recent week ha yet to make substantial gain and while he welcomed mr wang at the kremlin and spoke of a coming visit from china s president xi jinping it is clear that china is wary about being seen a supporting the war and at a moment when american official are releasing intelligence suggesting that mr putin is again seeking arm and technology from beijing china is willing to work with russia to maintain a strategic focus deepen mutual political trust and enhance strategic coordination mr wang told mr putin he also said the chinese russian partnership is not aimed at any third party and will not accept meddling from any third party and even le will it accept duress from any third party that wa a clear reference to the united state which ha threatened that any material aid from china to moscow s war effort would result in economic reprisal keeping china in his corner is a priority for mr putin with russia looking to beijing a a critical trading partner in the face of western sanction in an apparent nod to china s discomfort with being seen a a military ally mr putin said in his televised opening remark to mr wang that economic issue were above all the field in which the two country relationship wa reaching new frontier still chinese and russian naval ship are holding drill off the coast of south africa this week a reminder that the two country are also deepening their military cooperation mr putin at least economically is clearly the junior member of the partnership it is the reverse of soviet day when few imagined that china might become the world s second largest economy in the view of american official mr xi ha his doubt about supporting russia s invasion but is happy to aid mr putin both to distract the united state from it economic competition with beijing and to tie up the american

now he doesn t care about u he added that biden can send every agency he want to but i found out this morning in one of the briefing that he wa in the ukraine giving million of dollar away to people over there not to u and i m furious read more train carrying hazardous chemical derails meanwhile state and federal official of both party have assured local that all is well and that the water in the town is safe however biden s environmental protection agency epa deemed the water safe to drink based on only a few tainted lab sample provided by norfolk southern the rail company responsible for the catastrophe apparently the epa never tested the water sample itself according to report the rail company plan to create a million fund for the resident of east palestine which a commentator have pointed out is far below the billion it spent on stock buyback last year in all that amount to about a pop for the town s nearly resident apparently that s all the company think it should pay forward over this environmental disaster the cherry on top is that norfolk southern is reportedly asking the nation s supreme court to kill a lawsuit by a sick rail worker and help the firm block future lawsuit against itself over the incident the biden administration is now siding with the company a it did in december when it pushed a skinny deal on railway worker across the country who were threatening to strike over pay and working condition concern furthermore if secretary buttigieg the guy in charge of regulating the railway industry wa asked what the big deal is about he d tell you while this horrible situation ha gotten a particularly high amount of attention there are roughly case a year of a train derailing the dot is being heavily criticized for not reinstating an obama era rail safety rule to implement new braking system since the country s railway still use civil war era technology the trump administration repealed this mandate and the biden administration did not put it back on the book so whatever just get used to it the story of what happened in ohio is truly a tale of unbridled corporate greed coupled with politician unwilling to regulate the railway industry because of the powerful interest in washington that prop it up it transcends party line both republican and democrat are at fault for failing to regulate railway and spewing the company s propaganda after the incident on february rd even defaulting to their in house water test the corruption on display truly boggles the mind read more biden s kiev trip a slap in the face to america u congressman oddly all biden had to do wa show up to at least display the slightest amount of empathy required to win the ensuing political battle literally to just physically be at the site of the incident shake hand kiss baby and give a speech where he promise to help those affected but instead of doing the absolute bare minimum he fly halfway across the world to ukraine and pledge half a billion dollar on top of the billion already given for a war that ha nothing to do with the interest of average american biden just gave a healthy serving of political point to donald trump on a silver platter doubtless trump will point out biden s hypocrisy lack of interest or care and perhaps even his relentless pro war agenda it will be a speech that many independent might find appealing and it will certainly tap into the angst of the white midwestern american working class which is to note an essential demographic for anyone who want to become president of the united state the biden administration s failure on this issue is immense it is not just that he materially failed to safeguard american well being but he also made trump whose former presidential administration wa an absolute calamity for the working class the winner in all of this it is hard to find an explanation for how someone with year of political experience could so massively screw this up ukraine plan to push for an extension of the un brokered black sea grain initiative for at least one more year reuters reported on wednesday citing yury vaskov the country s deputy minister of infrastructure the un backed agreement which wa reached last july between ukraine russia and t rkiye allowed shipment of wheat and other agricultural product interrupted by the conflict with russia to resume according to vaskov kiev will also seek approval to have new port come under the scope of the agreement currently the deal cover three ukrainian port odessa chernomorsk and yuzhny together they export about million ton a month but the addition of the port of nikolaev could add an additional million to this capacity vaskov said a formal proposal will come from u this week on the need to work on an extension we will request to extend it not for day but for at least one year because the ukrainian and global agricultural market need to be able to plan these volume of export in the long term the official noted in an interview to reuters he added that kiev would also demand an increase in the number of cargo inspection team in order to eliminate the accumulation of vessel waiting for inspection the party to the deal are expected to start talk on an extension later this week but the exact date ha not yet been set the initial day agreement ha already been already extended once in

access to europe it s impossible to know where they ll come down he added the u s and it nato ally have repeatedly warned that any nation including china will see swift and severe economic sanction if they are found aiding russia s war effort china ha toed the line when it come to the war in ukraine refusing to condemn russia s invasion but also failing to provide arm to it chief international partner ryan explained that the partnership between russia and china is down to the joint interest of moscow and beijing to see western influence drop to enhance their global ambition particularly in the southern hemisphere but the ramification of chinese lethal aid to russia could have global consequence security analyst have long argued that the war in ukraine is about more than the survival of kyiv it is a proxy war between russia and the u s ukraine is outmanned when it come to the sheer number of personnel russia can dedicate to it front line but the training munition and defensive aid it is receiving from the west is giving kyiv an edge on the battlefield an advantage that could be taken away if russia is able to start better arming it troop it really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracy on one side the united state and it democratic ally with the european and south korea japan australia of course supporting sanction against russia and then on the other side russia north korea iran and china kroenig laid out expert agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the u s and nato troop against russia and chinese force though the conflict brewing over taiwan could be a different story klinck said that the revelation that china is considering arming russia underscore that there are debate in beijing over how it should act and the strategic calculus of it action history show that sanction imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actor he added

that washington wa already aware of china s non lethal support for moscow and threatened serious consequence if that support escalated to lethal weapon china s foreign ministry responded to blinken in a similar manner a wang did to borrell urging the u to seriously reflect on it role in stoking the ukraine conflict it is the u not china that ha been pouring weapon into the battlefield a ministry spokesman said on monday china ha repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and plan on releasing a peace proposal in the near future meanwhile beijing and moscow have stepped up

meloni of italy met with president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine in kyiv on tuesday and pledged to continue to provide military financial and humanitarian support she also said she backed ukraine s entry into the european union and that she would ensure that any peace agreement with russia would be brokered on ukraine s term those who support ukraine militarily are working for peace m meloni said tuesday evening during a joint news conference with mr zelensky supplying military plane to ukraine wa not on the table but italy wa considering sending more air defense system she added m meloni said that her coalition government which ha been in power since october had remained compact in it support of ukraine despite some declaration a pointed reference to comment made recently by one of her ally the former prime minister silvio berlusconi last week mr berlusconi a longtime friend of president vladimir v putin of russia blamed mr zelensky for the invasion of ukraine saying he should have stopped attacking the contested donbas region playing into mr putin s false pretext of invading ukraine to stop a genocide against ethnic russian another of m meloni s ally matteo salvini built part of his populist career out of opposing sanction on russia and once said he preferred mr putin to his own president mr zelensky addressing mr berlusconi s criticism at the news conference on tuesday said the former prime minister never had to deal with tank arriving in his backyard or russian airstrikes bombarding his home i think mr berlusconi ha not had to get up at three in the morning because of blackout to start washing clothes making food for his child two day in advance because there may not be power for the next two three day because of the great love of the brotherly russian people he said according to reuters condemning the russian invasion m meloni said on tuesday that the fate of the european union and western democracy also depends on ukraine s victory in the face of those who want to trample international law by force the only peace possible would be one agreed to by ukraine she said and could not involve ukrainian surrender just a a victory of russia would not be peace but a prelude to the possible invasion of other european state ukraine s interest coincide with those of europe she said m meloni arrived in kyiv by train earlier on tuesday traveling from poland where she had met with polish official and reiterated italy s unwavering support for ukraine it wa the first time in kyiv for m meloni a hard right leader who so far ha governed in a far le vitriolic and ideological and more practical way than her detractor had predicted after she took office in october m meloni also said that italy wa planning to host an international conference in april on the reconstruction of ukraine rebuilding a destroyed building is a sign of hope she said and because speaking of ukraine s reconstruction mean betting on the victory of ukraine before meeting with mr zelensky m meloni visited bucha a suburb of kyiv where retreating russian soldier massacred civilian in the early week of the war and irpin one of the first ukrainian city to be destroyed and liberated in irpin she distributed aid to civilian and signed a ukrainian flag with the word at your side the head of russia s wagner mercenary group accused the country s defense minister and it most senior general of treason on tuesday intensifying the most high profile dispute in the russian force since the invasion of ukraine began wagner s founder yevgeny prigozhin who ha been taking aim at military leader in a series of increasingly hostile audio message on social medium this week accused the chief of the general staff and minister of defense of withholding ammunition and supply from his fighter to try to destroy wagner which can be equated to treason a bunch of military related official have decided that it is their country that it is their people mr prigozhin said in one profanity laden audio message published by his press service on tuesday they have decided that these people will die when it is convenient to them when they feel like it russia s defense ministry denied mr prigozhin s claim and raised the stake by indirectly accusing the wagner leader of damaging the war effort in a statement released on tuesday night the defense ministry listed the amount of ammunition and fire cover provided in recent day to volunteer storm unit it euphemism for wagner attempt to sow rift in the tight mechanism of cooperation and support among the unit of russian force are counterproductive and are only aiding the enemy the ministry said mr prigozhin s vitriol highlighted the increasingly tense competition for resource among russian military leader a the war in ukraine enters it second year said dmitri kuznets a military analyst for the independent russian news outlet meduza he said it also showed how the war wa reshaping russian politics prigozhin is positioning himself a a de facto leader of a faction opposed to the military establishment in russia s main political arena which today is the war said mr kuznets a native of st petersburg mr prigozhin operated for year in secrecy using connection forged with vladimir v putin when mr putin worked in that city to win catering and construction contract with the government after making his fortune he began building up wagner using his mercenary force both to expand his business and to advance the kremlin s political goal in eastern ukraine syria and africa the invasion of ukraine supercharged his public profile turning him from a shadow operator into one of the most visible face of the kremlin s military effort and a the russian armed force suffered one humiliating setback after another mr prigozhin presented wagner a a bulwark of russian interest in his social medium appearance mr prigozhin offered a stark contrast to the straight faced kremlin apparatchik appearing in battlefield catacomb the cockpit of an airborne military jet and siberian penal colony swelled with recruit from russian prison wagner emerged a a capable fighting formation leading the monthslong assault on the ukrainian city of bakhmut which ha become the focal battle of the war wagner ha gradually tightened it grip on the city in recent week by overrunning surrounding village in a series of costly frontal assault wagner s gain around bakhmut have made it the only russian force to make meaningful progress since offensive operation were revved up this month that probably stoked jealousy from the military command mr kuznets said but mr prigozhin s growing self promotion and disdain for bureaucracy have begun to cause concern among some kremlin insider some see in his social medium performance a hint of political ambition now mr prigozhin s long running criticism of the military hierarchy once oblique ha taken on an aggressive even desperate tone just a the battle for bakhmut appears to be entering a critical phase explaining his decision to go public with his accusation against the military commander mr prigozhin in one audio message said i don t have an option i m going until the end my people are dying in heap he said mr prigozhin accused the russian defense minister sergei k shoigu and the chief of the general staff valery v gerasimov of deliberately starving wagner of supply using their title but not directly naming the two men the accusation came day after mr prigozhin said the defense ministry had banned him from recruiting new fighter from russian jail to bleed out wagner and deny it victory in bakhmut since last summer wagner ha recruited ten of thousand of convict by securing a presidential pardon for the enlisted men a campaign that appeared to show the extent of mr prigozhin s influence with mr putin but this week s audio message suggest that his access to the russian leader may be waning some analyst said this is an act of desperation one political scientist tatiana stanovaya wrote on the telegram messaging app on monday it s an attempt to reach putin through publicity to scare the military command with political consequence mr prigozhin said monday that he had not had problem with ammunition under the last commander of russian force in ukraine gen sergei surovikin referring to him by name general surovikin wa replaced by general gerasimov last month some analyst have interpreted the appointment of general gerasimov who hold a position equivalent to the chairman of the joint chief of staff in the united state a an attempt to improve coordination between russia s fighting force ahead of a spring offensive even a mr prigozhin escalated his attack on the military command he appeared to be trying to shore up alliance with other paramilitary leader who could be affected by the shake up of the russian military in recent day he ha posted photo and video with apti alaudinov commander of pro kremlin chechen fighter in ukraine and eduard basurin a former commander of a pro russian militia in the donbas region of eastern ukraine mr alaudinov s bos the chechen strongman ramzan kadyrov ha also criticized the wartime performance of russian general and prominent russian military blogger said last week that mr basurin had fallen victim to moscow s recent purge of donbas separatist officer mr prigozhin s caustic audio message were especially remarkable given that they were released just before mr putin made his state of the nation address in moscow in which he called for unity in a war that he falsely said had been caused by western aggression mr prigozhin did not appear to be among the dozen of military leader and decorated soldier present for the address and mr putin did not mention wagner during his lengthy praise of the russian military in ukraine mr putin said he had chosen to omit the name of various volunteer unit from his speech i wa afraid of upsetting those whom i would not mention he said when asked by a journalist to comment on the speech mr prigozhin said he had been too busy to watch it a response that played into his image a a maverick m stanovaya said the public tension between wagner and the defense ministry were unlikely to be well received by the russian president who ha made obedience and coordination between subordinate a cornerstone of his rule i can say with almost percent certainty that all of these clash this infighting are infuriating mr putin she wrote but mr prigozhin appeared to be far from backing down he called the defense ministry s response to his complaint a spit in the direction of pmc wagner and an attempt to hide their crime against those fighter warsaw when president vladimir v putin announced at the end of a minute speech on tuesday that he would suspend russia s participation in the new start treaty the last surviving arm control agreement between the two largest nuclear armed power it wa the latest sign that the decade long era of formal arm control may be dying mr putin made clear that he wa not pulling out of the treaty which expires in february and hour after the speech russia s foreign ministry declared the country had no intention to deploy more strategic nuclear arm the kind that can soar across continent beyond the limit of the treaty which keep both side to nuclear weapon that set aside at least for the next few year the prospect of a resumed arm race between the two largest nuclear power but the chance are rapidly diminishing that russia and the united state in the midst of the bitter war in ukraine and mutual recrimination on a scale not seen in decade can find their way to sit down to negotiate a replacement treaty much le agree to one and mr putin s declaration that he will block american inspector from verifying treaty compliance made clear once again that he view his nuclear arsenal a a key element of power a he try to revive his stumbling effort to take over a nation whose right to exist a an independent state he refuse to acknowledge he is also retreating from new start at a critical moment china ha made clear it is determined to build an arsenal the size of washington and moscow s international inspector have now discovered new evidence that iran is making rapid progress in making near bomb grade nuclear fuel north korea spent the weekend testing it own intercontinental ballistic missile every sign indicates the world may be on the verge of a new era of nuclear breakout more broadly mr putin sounded like a leader who wa done with arm control after year of suspended inspection because of the pandemic and then a confrontation with the united state and nato escalated if that attitude hold whoever is sitting in the oval office when the treaty expires in a bit more than day may face a new world that will look at first glance similar to the one of a half century ago when arm race were in full swing and nation could field a many nuclear weapon a they wanted it wa a reminder of how fragile the scant remaining restraint on nuclear weapon worldwide appear year after president barack obama in a signature speech in prague called on all power to work toward a world without nuclear weapon while mr obama acknowledged he might not see that day in his lifetime it seemed for a brief while that the major nuclear power were on a path to shrinking their arsenal and relying le on nuclear weapon for defense and deterrence that day appears over at least for the foreseeable future with russia breaking treaty china building up north korea testing missile and iran now close to weapon grade uranium it is a bad period for nuclear stability and restraint said jon wolfsthal a senior adviser to global zero a group that advocate the abolition of nuclear weapon and a fellow at the center for a new american security mr wolfsthal who worked for president biden when he wa vice president and then for mr obama s national security council on arm control said he feared mr putin s declaration while more a political declaration than a military one is likely to stoke the growing call for the u s to expand it nuclear arsenal to both compete with russia and show china they cannot catch u even before mr putin spoke implementation of the new start treaty wa already in deep trouble the state department announced last month that the russian were out of compliance but on tuesday the russian leader made clear that the united state could now forget about inspecting russian nuclear site a central element of verifying compliance with the treaty s mandate not surprisingly mr putin argued that he wa forced into his decision by american action they want to inflict strategic defeat on u he said picking up a phrase that american official have used to describe their desired outcome for russia in the war against ukraine and climb on our nuclear facility he also noted that the ukrainian had already used drone to attack strategic air base in russia where the russian air force keep the bomber that can deliver nuclear weapon those attack happened though they appear to have done limited damage he said he wasn t now about to allow inspector to survey nuclear facility because they could pa their finding on to the ukrainian to launch further attack this is a theater of the absurd he said we know that the west is directly involved in the attempt of the kyiv regime to strike at the base none of this change the status quo ante very much nuclear inspection were suspended during the covid pandemic when inspector on either side couldn t get into russia or the united state but over the past year a travel restriction lifted russian came up with reason to deny inspection and charged a mr putin did again on tuesday that the united state wa not living up to it inspection requirement either american official insisted several month ago that they have resolved access issue and would allow in russian inspector a long a american inspector had reciprocal right the united state retains considerable visibility over the russian arsenal chiefly with satellite that keep track of russian nuclear movement but there is a deeper worry the five year extension of new start that president biden and mr putin agreed upon in the first month of the biden presidency is the only one permitted under the agreement which wa negotiated during mr obama s tenure that mean an entirely new treaty would have to be pieced together and while american official insist that they want to negotiate a new agreement it is increasingly hard to imagine that happening in the next three year the reason are numerous first there is virtually no communication between the two country the strategic stability talk that mr biden and mr putin agreed upon in june at their only face to face meeting a president started off with a promising dialogue the two side agreed briefly to talk about traditional arm control and what to do with novel weapon including a range of new nuclear device under development by russia the russian in turn want limit on what the united state call upgrade to it own weapon but those discussion never got off the ground they were suspended after the invasion of ukraine second trust between the two country is virtually nonexistent mr putin and mr biden have not spoken directly in more than a year in the ensuing time mr biden ha described the russian leader a a war criminal and mr putin ha called the american president the aggressor in ukraine in private american official sometimes concede that even if they negotiated a treaty it would be almost impossible to imagine the senate ratifying it under these condition third the treaty a it stand doe not cover the nuclear weapon the world worry about most in conflict such a in ukraine the battlefield nuke or tactical nuclear weapon that mr putin ha episodically threatened to employ against ukrainian force russia ha or so the united state ha a few hundred finally another treaty only between moscow and washington no longer make sense to many nuclear expert the pentagon now estimate that china which is rapidly expanding it arsenal could deploy weapon in the next dozen year matching the american and russian arsenal so an arm control treaty that left out one of the three major power would be all but useless and so far china ha showed no interest in joining negotiation if there were any still secretary of state antony j blinken said on tuesday after mr putin spoke that he would be willing to negotiate a new treaty that wa clearly in the security interest of our country and he added in the security interest of russia mr putin s announcement he added wa deeply unfortunate and irresponsible but he suggested that the united state would not change it compliance with the treaty no matter what russia did i think it matter that we continue to act responsibly in this area he said it s also something the rest of the world expects of u china dismissed criticism from the u s about it apparent support for russia in it invasion of ukraine on tuesday accusing the u s of fanning the flame of conflict in the region chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin attempted to turn the table on the u s during a tuesday press briefing after the u s accused china of potentially providing lethal aid to russia wang said the u s defense industry is profiting

president biden and vladimir v putin laid out radically different vision on tuesday for ukraine s future offering sharply contrasting narrative about who is to blame for the bloody yearlong war and seeming to agree on only one point the conflict is nowhere near an end mr biden repeatedly blamed mr putin the president of russia for dragging europe back to brutality on a scale not seen since world war ii hundred of thousand killed or wounded and whole city ruined he accused the russian leader of wide ranging atrocity and called on the world to stand up to him and other tyrant autocrat only understand one word no no no mr biden declared standing under a cold drizzle in front of an enthusiastic crowd of thousand waving american and ukrainian flag at the royal castle in warsaw president putin chose this war he added every day the war continues is his choice he could end the war with a word mr putin expected kyiv ukraine s capital to fall to the russian invasion but kyiv stand mr biden thundered appearing energized by his surprise trip to that city the day before but he added that the fight continued and that there would be hard and very bitter day victory and tragedy in

drama of the cold war by announcing a suspension of russia s participation in the last remaining nuclear treaty with america whose verification requirement his country had already been ignoring the russian leader much like his american counterpart in the dueling address indicated a grim immediate future ahead in ukraine one where the grinding war is likely to continue for year testing the patience of russia s people business leader and already bloodied military mr putin spent much of the minute speech on the nut and bolt of preparing russia for a long term confrontation he urged oligarch to bring their money home because he said western country could not be trusted he promised change to russia s education system and to science and technology policy dragging them back from western style approach to help the country outlast sanction and though he did not acknowledge the heavy loss russian force have suffered he pledged that soldier and draftee taking part in the war would receive two week of leave every six month mr putin underpinned all of that with his usual appeal to cultural issue even citing the church of england s consideration of gender neutral term to refer to god million of people in the west understand that they are being led to a real spiritual catastrophe mr putin said though he did not mention mr biden by name the elite one must say are simply going crazy mr biden s aide said the president s intention wa to mark friday s anniversary of the russian invasion by celebrating allied solidarity and delivering the message that freedom and democracy were at stake on the battlefield of ukraine but the split screen moment wa undeniable a the two leader spoke about mile and a few hour apart mr biden did not call mr putin a war criminal a he did from warsaw in march of last year but he leveled a string of accusation against mr putin including taking ukrainian child in an attempt to steal the country s future and for month cutting off export of ukrainian grain causing a global food shortage putin tried to starve the world he said the speech came at a critical moment while the european ally have held together far more effectively than anyone expected a year ago there were sign at the munich security conference which concluded on sunday that many european leader are wondering whether they will be able to sustain the current level of spending on arm government support and humanitarian aid to ukraine mr biden praised the spirit of the people of moldova a former soviet republic for having the resolve to live in freedom and he recalled how pole endured for decade under the iron fist of communist rule he suggested that moldova poland and pro democracy dissident in belarus russia s authoritarian ally represent the thirst for freedom in the face of oppressive regime mr biden acknowledged that there were real question when the war started about whether the democratic nation of europe and the world would rise to the challenge those question he said have now been answered yes we would stand up for sovereignty and we did mr biden told the crowd which stood bathed in light aimed at the century old castle yes we

mr patrushev told mr wang that both nation were under pressure from the collective west so that their deepening cooperation is taking on special significance mr wang said that russia and china should develop new step of strategic cooperation in accordance with the changing situation mr wang will hold more meeting in moscow on wednesday and the kremlin ha hinted at a meeting with mr putin in mr putin s speech on tuesday the only major revelation wa that he would not allow u s inspection to verify compliance with new start a nuclear arm control treaty that is set to expire in three year he did not signal any major change in how he would wage the war in ukraine there wa no official declaration of war no announcement of a new draft and no new threat of using nuclear weapon instead mr putin s main underlying message wa that russian and implicitly the western coalition that opposes him must prepare for the war which he continued to call a special military operation to last for year we will solve the task before u step by step carefully and consistently he said claiming that the west wa trying to shift a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation he pledged that we will respond accordingly the more long range weapon the west delivers to ukraine he said the farther we will be forced to move the threat from our border the confident picture presented by mr putin drew plenty of applause from the ruling elite regional official lawmaker patriarch kirill of the russian orthodox church gathered in a hall across red square from the kremlin it ignored russia s repeated setback at the front and it bloody slow moving effort to eke out territorial gain in eastern ukraine his word signaled that russia wa prepared to intensify the fighting but they sounded le ominous than the barely veiled threat he made several time last year about the potential use of nuclear weapon mr putin s tone wa more measured than that in his last major speech to the nation in september when he announced a military draft and said he wa ready to use all the mean at our disposal to protect russia and our people everything is changing now changing very fast mr putin said on tuesday referring to the consequence of war and of sanction this is a time of not just challenge but of opportunity mr putin suggested that time wa on his side because ukraine s people could still turn against their government and the west could face it own political upheaval after listing example of what he described a the west s moral depravity mr putin said that many people around the world agreed with him there wa no new policy evident in mr biden s speech either though the president promised new sanction on russia by the end of the week and said vaguely that we will hold accountable those who are responsible for the war he did not address the limitation of sanction which the west ha discovered a china india and turkey among others have kept buying russian petroleum product mr biden thanked poland for taking in million ukrainian war refugee and for becoming the primary transfer point for a flood of arm that have been critical for ukraine s military force but his rallying cry to the polish people omitted discussion of the white house s current worry mr biden and his aide are concerned that the war could be devolving into a stalemate in which neither side will negotiate but neither can turn the tide he made no reference to mr putin s announcement about new start nor did he mention mr putin s episodic threat to employ nuclear weapon usually uttered when russian force were losing ground but while the white house ha tried at various point to make the case that the war in ukraine is a battle for the preservation of some norm of national behavior respect for the sovereignty of nation and the right of population to choose their leader he kept returning to mr putin himself at one point he mocked one of the russian leader s core claim that russia invaded in self defense mr putin said earlier in the day that nato had been planning to attack russia presumably from inside ukraine the west wa not plotting to attack russia mr biden said the war he argued wa brought about solely by the russian leader s desire but president putin s craven lust for land and power will fail joe biden is pursuing a blank check policy towards ukraine while turning a blind eye

half hour to reach it destination during that time he wa potentially exposed to circumstance beyond the control of the hypervigilant security phalanx that normally seek to shield a commander in chief from every conceivable physical danger and minimize his time outside a hardened shelter for much of the past year in fact most of the people around the president resisted any urge to go on the assumption that it wa too risky but nearly a year after the russian invasion with ukrainian troop faring far better than anyone expected at the start and other american and european leader having made the trip mr biden and his team gambled that he could get in and out safely of course there wa still risk and is still risk in an endeavor like this jake sullivan the president s national security adviser told reporter by phone from the train a it departed kyiv for the return trip to poland and president biden felt that it wa important to make this trip because of the critical juncture that we find ourselves at a we approach the one year anniversary of russia s full scale invasion of ukraine it wa a long journey and a surreal one this wa not how mr biden wa used to seeing ukraine he visited six time a vice president three time in a six month stretch arriving in an american jet gazing out the window in daylight to take in the sight of kyiv from above now he wa sneaking in under cover of darkness arriving shortly after sunrise the trip had been in the work for month aide said a just a trusted few official at the white house pentagon secret service and intelligence agency weighed the threat assessment in meeting mr biden focused on the risk his visit could pose to others not himself one aide said finally the decision came to a head on friday when the president gathered with a handful of top adviser in the oval office and consulted with others by phone he opted to go mr biden wa already set to travel to poland for the anniversary often when president make secret stop in uncertain location the visit are added to the end of an existing trip in this case the white house decided to put it on the front end in hope of keeping the secret the president played his part in the ruse on saturday evening he and jill biden went to mass at georgetown university then stopped by the national museum of american history and finally went out to dinner at the red hen restaurant where they enjoyed the rigatoni widely considered the best in the nation s capital when the couple arrived back at the white house most people might have assumed they were in for the night but a few hour after midnight mr biden wa spirited out of the mansion and taken to joint base andrew in the maryland suburb where a small coterie of aide security agent a medical team a white house photographer and two journalist awaited him the two journalist sabrina siddiqui from the wall street journal and evan vucci from the associated press had been summoned to the white house on friday and sworn to secrecy they were told to wait for further information in an email whose subject line would read arrival instruction for the golf tourney the two person journalism pool wa a radical departure from even other security sensitive presidential trip when the usual complement of reporter and photographer wa taken but it would not be the only unusual feature of the trip since abraham lincoln rode to the front line outside washington to watch battle in northern virginia during the civil war no sitting president ha gotten that close to combat franklin d roosevelt visited north africa lyndon b johnson went to vietnam bill clinton toured the balkan george w bush and barack obama traveled to iraq and afghanistan and donald j trump went to afghanistan but in all those case they went to country or area under control of american force or after hostility had eased in this case the united state military would not be present in ukraine nor would it control the airspace american military plane were spotted hovering in eastern poland near the border during the trip but official said they never entered ukrainian airspace out of concern that it would be taken a the sort of direct american intervention that mr biden ha avoided arriving at andrew on early sunday morning the two journalist surrendered their phone not to be returned for hour they were taken not to the usual blue and white boeing designated a air force one when the president is on board but to an air force c more typically used for domestic trip to airport with shorter runway the plane wa parked in the dark next to a hangar with shade drawn mr biden arrived about a m and the plane took off at a m for the flight across the atlantic mr biden wa joined by a handful of aide mr sullivan jen o malley dillon a deputy chief of staff and annie tomasini the director of oval office operation the plane touched down at ramstein air base in germany at p m local time where with it shade down it wa refueled before taking off again at p m it then made it way to rzesz w jasionka airport in poland landing at p m mr biden wa put in a motorcade with roughly car and driven without siren for about an hour along a mostly empty highway to the small city of przemy l and taken to the train station where many thousand of refugee have arrived from ukraine over the past year arriving at p m the traveler found few people there and the stall closed the motorcade pulled right up to a mostly purple train with several car painted blue with a yellow stripe along the middle to resemble the ukrainian flag rarely doe a president ride in any vehicle other than those of the secret service or american military but flying into ukraine is not deemed safe the train pulled away from the station without ceremony at p m and crossed the border into ukraine around p m the white house wa so intent on keeping the secret that it lied to reporter back in washington about four hour after mr biden crossed the border into ukraine his office back in washington issued a public schedule falsely stating that the president wa still in the nation s capital and not planning to leave for europe until monday evening dressed in casual clothes mr biden had a hard time sleeping during the long train ride according to a senior official who asked not to be identified describing the trip the president spent the ride recalling his previous trip to kyiv including a speech to the ukrainian parliament and his remark on his final trip in he read a briefing memo on the history of kyiv back to it founding and reflected on his history with the city talking with aide mr biden recounted his telephone call with mr zelensky on feb last year a russia s invasion began marveling about how the ukrainian leader told him at the time that he wa not sure when they would speak again now mr biden mused to aide here they were a year later about to meet face to face in kyiv after the all night trip the train pulled into kyiv pasazhyrsky station at a m local time the platform had been cleared on a sunny day with blue sky and a brisk chill in the air mr biden disembarked now wearing a blue suit with a tie featuring ukrainian color he wa greeted by bridget a brink the american ambassador it s good to be back in kyiv he said during his five hour in the city he met with mr zelensky at mariinsky palace joined him in laying a wreath at the wall of remembrance at st michael s golden domed monastery and stopped by the united state embassy to meet with it staff then he headed back to the same train station departing at p m on the long meandering train ride back to poland the senior official said the president issued a series of direction on military economic and diplomatic area to help ukraine he wa seized with the meeting he had just had once again he could not sleep much he arrived at the przemy l g wny station at p m local time and he headed back to the airport for a flight to warsaw where he will deliver a speech on tuesday his mind aide said remained on his last stop kyiv he had said before leaving ha captured a part of my heart i must say warsaw president biden s sudden appearance in kyiv s presidential palace on monday morning wa intended first a a morale booster for shellshocked ukrainian in the midst of a bleak winter of power outage and a bitter war of attrition but it wa also the first of several direct challenge on this trip to president vladimir v putin who a year ago this week believed the ukrainian capital would become russian controlled territory again in a matter of day moving mr putin closer to his ambition of restoring the empire of peter the great putin s war of conquest is failing mr biden declared from the palace his very presence there alongside president volodymyr zelensky meant to symbolize russia s failure to take a capital that today remains brimming with life it restaurant overflowing even a warning siren blare one year later he said kyiv stand and ukraine stand democracy stand the war in ukraine is about power and the principle of territorial sovereignty and whether the western designed global order that american thought would prevail for decade will in fact survive new challenge from moscow and beijing but it is increasingly a contest between two aging cold warrior one year old and another who just turned who have been circling each other for year and now are engaged in everything short of direct battle on tuesday the vastly different world view of these two leader will become vividly apparent in a rare split screen moment they will both deliver speech several hour and mile apart vowing to stick with the war until the other retreat mr putin will go first marking the first anniversary of his ill fated invasion with what by all indication will be a renewal of a strategy that ha already led to russian casualty by british and american estimate and a many a russian killed mr putin will make the case anew that he is not only saving ukraine from nazism but saving russia itself from being overrun by nato a claim that seems ridiculous to european but that ha become a rallying cry in moscow if the past year is any guide he is almost certain to cast his war a a battle for the restoration of russia s historic land american intelligence official say they are picking up indication that he may soon mobilize more russian into the military adding hundred of thousand to the already called up hour later from warsaw s ancient royal castle on a hill over the polish capital mr biden is expected to build on the case he made in kyiv on monday morning that in the battle between democracy and autocracy the former ha emerged the winner of the first year of what promise to be a long conflict mr biden wa in kyiv on monday for le than six hour before the secret service whisked him out of the city notably the white house informed the kremlin of mr biden s impending visit before the president arrived not a a diplomatic courtesy but for what mr biden s national security adviser jake sullivan called deconfliction purpose essentially to avoid a russian strike accidental or otherwise mr sullivan added i won t get into how they responded the covert nature of the kyiv visit and the vastly different world view the speech will represent underscore the degree to which the battle between these two men ha echo of exactly what mr biden said he wanted to avoid a replay of the worst day of the cold war it is not a direct parallel though this time china is a more powerful player which is why american official spent the weekend publicly warning the government of xi jinping not to provide lethal support that an increasingly stretched russian military desperately need in fact just a mr biden arrived in kyiv china s most senior foreign policy official wang yi arrived in moscow for meeting that promise to be far friendlier than his clash on saturday night with antony j blinken the secretary of state american official say mr wang and other chinese official want to help mr putin confront what they view a an arrogant hypocritical and declining united state but china say the relationship ha it limit to the point that mr xi publicly warned russia against using nuclear weapon mr biden ha his own confrontation with mr xi over surveillance technology china s arm buildup and taiwan but his face off with mr putin is more direct and more visceral perhaps the most personal confrontation between superpower leader since kennedy and khrushchev and even in the worst moment of that standoff the cuban missile crisis in the two leader were exchanging civil letter and looking for a way out they ultimately found one twenty one month ago when mr biden and mr putin met face to face for the only time since mr biden came to office that kind of wary relationship still seemed possible they met on the somewhat neutral ground of geneva in a library dominated by a huge globe that seemed a reminder of the fact that they were once again dividing up the world into ally and adversary mr putin praised mr biden a a very balanced professional man and very experienced mr biden played to mr putin s ego at the outset of the summit by referring to the united state and russia a two great power the hope wa that they could find some common ground and they emerged agreeing to set up government to government talk on two huge point of tension abating ransomware attack on american infrastructure hospital and government and strategic stability talk to map out the future of arm control there were a few promising meeting they spoke twice after that via a video link the last time on feb wa marked by a warning from mr biden that if mr putin pulled the trigger and ordered his troop massing on ukraine s border to invade there would be swift and severe cost on russia an aide who witnessed the call said mr putin shrugged like we ve heard that before and denied he had military action in mind they have not spoken since and the follow on talk they agreed to in geneva were halted by this past weekend vice president kamala harris appearing at the munich security conference wa accusing russia of crime against humanity and france s president emmanuel macron warned that the west had to be prepared for prolonged conflict and arm ukraine and itself accordingly there wa more discussion of how to produce mm howitzer round and where to find more leopard tank to send to ukraine than there wa of possible diplomatic solution everyone ukraine europe and now country in asia want to rearm richard fontaine the chief executive of the center for a new american security and a former republican national security official wrote after the munich conference and he noted a frisson of anxiety about whether the west s aid to ukraine could continue at current level for much longer meaning that in a long war of attrition moscow might have the upper hand mr zelensky appearing by video had one message to his weapon supplier we need to hurry up he said we need speed and for all the good feeling created by mr biden s visit on monday mr zelensky is unlikely to conclude that mr biden is hurrying enough mr biden remains worried aide report that the f fighter and long range missile that mr zelensky demand could provoke a wider more direct conflict with russia because they could reach deep into russian territory and that in turn might tempt mr putin to renew his threat to reach into his arsenal of tactical nuclear weapon it is unclear how mr biden s visit will affect mr putin s speech which presumably wa drafted long before the american president s surprise and somewhat taunting appearance it wa mr biden s eighth visit to kyiv he noted a he sat with mr zelensky in front of a fireplace but mr putin s speech will be his first state of the nation address since he skipped it last year analyst believe because he lacked good news to share amid russia s setback at the front but the approaching anniversary of the invasion along with a lack of clarity even among mr putin s supporter about the nature of his exact goal in ukraine may have forced his hand the speech is now widely anticipated to include wide ranging attack on the west grounded in mr putin s contention that the united state is using ukraine to wage a proxy war against russia i believe that president putin s address won t have anything good for the liberal konstantin malofeyev an ultraconservative russian business magnate and a prominent cheerleader of the invasion said in a phone interview over the weekend dismissing the possibility that mr putin could use his speech to try to lower tension with the west russia mr malofeyev went on will keep fighting until it achieves victory in ukraine because our commander in chief himself understands that we now have no other choice tatiana stanovaya a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace wrote that while mr putin s address wa already expected to be very hawkish additional edits could be made now to make it even tougher russian medium wasted no time casting mr biden s visit to kyiv a proving mr putin s contention that america is behind the fighting ria novosti the russian state news agency quoted an analyst a saying that mr biden s visit showed that mr zelensky s government wa an instrument of the collective west and a mr putin ha pivoted from engagement to aggression mr biden became the leader of the western elite who mr putin declared last september are russia s enemy in the kremlin s propaganda mr biden is now invariably portrayed a senile sleepy and out of touch tuesday s succession of speech will also reflect the two president different constituency and political vulnerability mr biden s speech will be open to the public in poland mr putin will speak in a hall across red square from the kremlin with russia s ruling elite regional governor lawmaker and other official in attendance for mr biden it is the ever shifting political wind inside the united state that represent the greatest vulnerability to his ability to stay the course in ukraine already there are objection on the far left and far right though the core of republican and democratic support ha held for mr putin the big concern is that moscow s disparate pro kremlin elite could fall out of line if russia s military continues to struggle but even russia admits there is a lot on the line dmitri s peskov mr putin s spokesman once treated the war a a small operation a sideshow that ordinary russian didn t have to think much about now that fiction can no longer be contained the special military operation affect our whole life the life of the continent in one way or another mr peskov said in a russian state television interview aired on sunday so one should expect that the president will devote a lot of attention to it chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin ha shot back at washington s accusation that beijing is considering providing lethal support for moscow in ukraine the

the russian president with any name visit ukraine kneel before the monument to the victim of russian aggression and begin to beg for forgiveness for me this will be the end of the military conflict the russian president kneel in ukraine begging for forgiveness the right word here manilov s dream of a bridge over a green pond with bench on it become quite realistic against the background of such urge of kuleba one could just laugh at it but the kiev neo nazi wa supported in the eye by the president of the czech republic in the past a general peter pavel i d be very happy if all of this happened within a few month but i don t live in a perfect world i m more of a skeptic i understand ukraine s desire to end this military conflict when all the soldier leave the last piece of ukrainian land and for the russian president to come to ukraine and ask for forgiveness on his knee he also dreamed and warned but we can get into a situation where the liberation of part of the ukrainian territory can lead to greater loss than society can suffer there may be a point when even ukraine will begin to think about another end to the military conflict moreover according to him even such a joyful ending for them can be complicated by not at all optimistic consequence even if there is a possibility of the collapse of the russian army the armed force of ukraine will oust them from ukraine then russia will collapse there will be no one to negotiate with regard to the security guarantee regime there will be no one to work with regarding the construction of a security architecture in europe pavel continued and warned with a collapsed russia we will have more problem that we do not even understand now i think it would be much better to be realistic hope for the best but be prepared for the worst had peter and kuleba been realistic they would not have carried such nonsense but would have thought about how to keep ukraine within the border that exist in reality and the same kuleba would rather think how to save himself from the dock and the prospect of life imprisonment however one cannot expect anything else from kuleba but how could the czech president serve a a general in nato with such brain or is the virus of ukrainianism so contagious that it devours brain in the shortest possible time leaving nothing in your head but a smelly russophobic slurry and they sit next to each other like a lady just nice and pleasant in every way and they dream in a completely manila way he thought about the well being of a friendly life about how nice it would be to live with a friend on the bank of some river then a bridge began to be built across this river then a huge house with such a high belvedere that you can even see moscow from there and drink tea in the open air in the evening and talk about some pleasant object then that they together with chichikov came to some society in good carriage where everyone is fascinated by the pleasantness of treatment and that it is a if the tsar having learned of their friendship granted them general and then finally god know what is which he himself could not make out true manilov wa just a harmless infantile dreamer in contrast

bragged in a phone interview on saturday the longer this war last the more russian society is cleansing itself from liberalism and the western poison that the invasion ha dragged on for a year ha made russia s transformation go far deeper he said than it would have had mr putin s hope for a swift victory been realized if the blitzkrieg had succeeded nothing would have changed he said the kremlin for year sought to keep mr malofeyev at arm s length even a he funded pro russian separatist in eastern ukraine and called for russia to be reformed into an empire of traditional value free of western influence but that changed after the invasion a mr putin turned traditional value into a rallying cry signing a new anti gay law for instance while styling himself a another peter the great retaking

loving president who would never attack another country so after the invasion started stunning some of the president s closest aide the kremlin scrambled to adjust it propaganda to justify it it wa the west that went to war against russia by backing nazi who took power in ukraine in the false message went and the goal of mr putin s special military operation wa to end the war the west had started in a series of address aimed at shoring up domestic support mr putin cast the invasion a a near holy war for russia s very identity declaring that it wa fighting to prevent liberal gender norm and acceptance of homosexuality from being forced upon it by an aggressive west the full power of the state wa deployed to spread and enforce that message national television channel all controlled by

one of the most emotionally evocative chapter of russian history their nation s victory in world war ii a nationwide campaign urging child to make candle for soldier ha become so popular he said that anyone questioning it in a school chat group might be called a nazi and an accomplice of the west at the same time he argued daily life ha changed little for russian without a family member fighting in ukraine which ha hidden or assuaged the cost of the war western official estimate that at least russian have been killed or wounded in ukraine a far more serious toll than analyst had predicted when the war began yet the economy ha suffered much le than analyst predicted with western sanction having failed to drastically reduce average russian quality of life even a many western brand departed one of the scariest observation i think is that for the most part nothing ha changed for people mr chernyshov said describing the urban rhythm of restaurant and concert and his student going

he said for criticizing mr putin in a youtube interview with radio liberty the american funded russian language news outlet they were the kind of comment that would probably not have been punished before the war now he said the government s repression of dissent is like a steamroller everyone is just being rolled into the asphalt mr malofeyev the conservative tycoon said russia still needed another year for society to cleanse itself completely from the last fateful year he said that anything short of victory in ukraine complete with a parade in kyiv could still cause some of the last

in ukraine and pledged to hold accountable all those who have perpetrated these crime a well a their superior in a statement later saturday anatoly antonov russia s ambassador to washington dismissed the comment a an attempt unprecedented in term of it cynicism to demonize russia expert warn that any legal process to investigate and prosecute crime against humanity would be long and tedious with

a result european airline are forced to choose longer route to asia to fly around russia due to sanction and the chinese use shorter route from asia to europe and vice versa that reduces the flight time between paris and for example seoul by a much a three hour and in such condition it is difficult for european to put it mildly to compete with chinese air carrier which are chosen by passenger

petition asserts that ukrainian need solidarity from germany but question whether berlin s current policy truly reflect the support they require what is now one year on the actual goal of this war the

kiev are we then inexorably sliding down a chute leading to a world war and nuclear war the petition asks adding that numerous major conflict have begun this way and that another could end up being the last for mankind the petition stress that to negotiate doesn t mean to capitulate but rather to make compromise on both side the author claim that half of the german population want immediate peace talk and suggest that the government should heed their call we demand that the federal chancellor stop the escalation of weapon delivery the document state urging official in berlin to focus on peace effort and form an international alliance to this end the petition had received signature at the time of writing moscow ha repeatedly signaled it is open to talk with kiev provided that ukrainian leader accept russia s condition and recognize what the kremlin call the reality on the ground in early october ukrainian president vladimir zelensky ruled out negotiation with his russian counterpart kiev is insisting on a military victory over russia and refuse to make any territorial concession to it neighbor after sending billion worth of military and financial aid to ukraine for a year the u is making plan to send auditor and inspector to kiev so they don t have to rely on second hand report the wall street journal reported on friday citing pentagon state department and usaid official the inspector general from the three respective agency told the outlet that so far oversight wa conducted using staff in poland and germany after going to kiev last month and meeting ukrainian official they decided to send some of their auditor and investigator into ukraine itself the trio met with ukraine s prime minister minister of defense and finance and the prosecutor general defense department ig robert storch told the journal adding that they emphasized the u expectation for accountability and also the importance of cooperation with our oversight work diana shaw deputy ig at the state department said the u ha given ukraine an incredibly large amount of assistance in a very short time and that any fraud waste abuse that would divert that funding from it intended purpose risk jeopardizing the continued flow of that assistance read more u struggling to track ukraine aid politico the u congress appropriated more than billion for aid to ukraine in in addition to pricey weapon system and ammunition washington ha sent kiev cash so the ukrainian government can continue to operate to monitor this flow the journal revealed washington ha relied on staff in nearby country the small staff of the u embassy in kiev eu official in ukraine and world bank personnel i think we have been a creative and you know out of the box forward leaning with the oversight we ve been able to accomplish so far but for real comprehensive robust oversight it can t be done remotely said nicole angarella acting deputy usaid inspector general shaw explained that the kiev trip wa intended to as whether we felt that we needed to have an on site presence in country and so coming back from that trip i think we feel that we do and so we re now in the process of pursuing that the inspector have thus far received no report of major fraud or illegality regarding the u aid according to the journal president vladimir zelensky s recent purge of ukrainian official a part of an anti corruption campaign had nothing to do with u aid they insisted while storch and shaw are mainly concerned with the military aid angarella is primarily concerned with more than billion the u is sending through the world bank to pay the salary of ukrainian government official cash payment are the greatest risk for oversight she said cash is fungible and you know is always at a higher risk according to angarella usaid ha assessed that proper control were in place to detect any misuse of funding while both the ruling democrat and the leadership of the opposition republican maintain the most important thing for the u to do is continue funding ukraine for a long a it take recent poll have shown american growing tired of the ever increasing aid to kiev while problem mount at home munich president emmanuel macron of france called on friday for an intensification of western support for ukraine but unlike other leader addressing the munich security conference he also underscored that peace negotiation were the ultimate goal mr macron declared that the neocolonialist and imperialist aggression against ukraine unleashed by president vladimir v putin of russia must fail calling russia s war catastrophic and unjustified at the same time he used word like dialogue and re engagement to describe an eventual interaction with russia in the future term that olaf scholz the german chancellor avoided in a speech immediately before mr macron s that wa uniformly resolute and offered no prediction of an end to the year old war answering question in english after delivering a speech in french mr macron said now the question is how to resist how to help the ukrainian to make on the ground something which will force russia to come back to the table on the condition of ukraine but ukrainian military resistance could not be the whole story he told the audience none of u will change geography and russia is on european soil he said given that we will have to negotiate of all major western leader mr macron ha most persistently referred to the inevitability of negotiation with mr putin s russia he ha stood out in arguing that peace talk must include security guarantee to russia such talk ha sometimes irritated volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president a well a leader of european union and nato state bordering russia who have long seen their western ally a being na ve about the threat of russian aggression they contend that only an outright defeat of mr putin whatever that may mean is acceptable mr macron s intricately calibrated argument on friday combining expression of resolve with the conviction that reason will one day demand a compromise to end the war wa typical of a leader who ha earned the sobriquet the at the same time president because of his penchant for back and forth analysis the goal of negotiation he said in response to question would have to be an imperfect balance that preserve something sustainable for russia itself but he added that it wa far too early to try to formulate any security arrangement that would end the war on term acceptable to kyiv and moscow this is not the time for dialogue he said the west must face the fact that although the week and month ahead could be decisive the war might last much longer mr macron said it wa critical he argued for europe and the united state to be credible over the long term if russia wa to come to the negotiating table in an acceptable way mr macron appears to have traveled some distance since declaring last year that it wa necessary to avoid humiliating russia and telling ukraine it would have to wait decade to join the european union while he spoke to mr putin on a regular basis just before the war and in it first several week clocking call between early december and late march mr macron ha not spoken to the russian leader since september a meeting this month in paris between mr macron and mr zelensky wa effusive in it tone of mutual friendship and support but an interview given just before the meeting by mr zelensky to the french newspaper le figaro and the german weekly magazine der spiegel revealed lingering tension in response to a question about whether mr macron had changed the ukrainian leader said i believe he ha changed and that this time he ha changed for real mr zelensky clearly meant that in his view mr macron had fully and unambiguously embraced the ukrainian cause the barbed remark did not go unnoticed by mr macron official close to him told the french daily le monde mr macron ha insisted that his view have remained largely constant denunciation of russia s illegal aggression against a sovereign state support for ukraine s war effort to the point of victory a word mr scholz ha declined to use to describe the objective of german support for kyiv and insistence that peace negotiation will be needed one day with moscow he ha also been insistent on the need to bolster european military capacity alongside nato and abandon the mind set of relying on the united state for protection he called on european state on friday to invest massively in our defense citing planned french military spending of billion between and or billion more than in the preceding six year period it is on the basis of a mental and material rearmament that i believe we will allow europe to occupy it rightful place in future security arrangement mr macron said mr scholz also spoke of the need to better integrate and bolster the european defense industry but alluded repeatedly to germany s intense cooperation with the united state throughout the war mr macron told the audience in munich that russia had failed on several front since invading ukraine it conviction that victory would be quick proved baseless it had become a force for disorder in the world a symbolized by the neo mafioso wagner mercenary operating a an arm of the kremlin it had consolidated the very ukrainian nationhood it denied and it had bolstered a nato alliance that mr putin demonizes with sweden and finland having decided to join a year ago mr macron said mr putin had told him in moscow that wagner operative were not ours in fact they pose u problem in russia mr macron conceded that he had believed mr putin at the time but said the truth of wagner s criminal activity a agent of the kremlin wa now evident france and russia have clashed in several african country where wagner is active moscow ha waged an intense propaganda war against france portraying it a an exploitative former colonial power in africa still mr macron noted russia endures a doe mr putin i don t believe for a second in regime change in moscow mr macron said describing regime change around the world in the past decade a a total failure on february a group of u backed democratic leader headed by a former western sponsored terrorist declared the independence of serbia s breakaway province of kosovo and metohija it full legal name under serbia s constitution it seemed oh so simple and straightforward at the zenith of the unipolar moment and kosovo albanian were confidently awaiting western recognition for their state despite the anger it secession provoked in serbia and russia s warning of fresh balkan unrest a a reuters report drily noted their confidence wa more than justified a of eu and of nato member state eventually recognized this unilateral act of secession pulling along many other smaller mostly western dependent country to follow suit un security council resolution according to which the province is to remain an autonomous province of serbia pending a mutually agreed final settlement wa ignored just a the un and international law were ignored in the spring of when nato unilaterally engaged in a day bombing campaign against the federal republic of yugoslavia under the familiar pretext of protecting democracy human right and the rule of law this resulted in nato s military occupation of the province that last to this day read more joining russia sanction would be inappropriate serbia the case of independent kosovo is in many way the perfect embodiment of the post cold war west s rule based order in contrast to international law which derives from the un charter and numerous universally accepted post wwii treaty and agreement the rule based order is pretty much anything it propagator deem it to be in accordance with their political interest du jour a russian foreign minister sergey lavrov put it these rule are created from scratch for each particular case they are written within a narrow circle of western country and palmed off a the ultimate truth in the case of kosovo and metohija the rule were to be tailored to the ambition of the unipolar hegemon and it vassal this formed the base of the collective west s failed attempt to declare this instance sui generis i e unique and incomparable to any other case in order to prevent others from referring to it a a precedent south ossetia abkhazia crimea the donbas and the kherson and zaporozhye region among others begged to differ and no the original goal of this unique rule setting wa not to protect democracy human right and the rule of law in serbia s historic province which host not only the site of the legendary battle of kosovo of the only battle in which an ottoman sultan wa killed but also hundred of serbian orthodox medieval church and monastery the true u interest wa much bigger and le benevolent and it wa revealed in a document memory holed by western mainstream medium a may letter to then german chancellor gerhard schr der by willy wimmer a member of the german bundestag and vice president of the parliamentary assembly of the osce wimmer s letter contains a description of a security conference that he had attended in the slovakian capital of bratislava that wa co organized by the u state department and the american enterprise institute aei a washington based think tank a list of participant and the agenda could at one time be found on the aei website but are no longer available at the time of writing almost all of the information available nowadays about it come from wimmer s account according to him the conference not only exposed the true cause of nato s brutal attack on yugoslavia and subsequent occupation of kosovo and metohija but also the purpose behind nato s further enlargement toward the border of russia and most importantly from the aspect of global security the u aim of undermining the international legal order a part of it drive for global domination in essence wimmer s report revealed the criminal plan that ha brought the world to the brink of global possibly nuclear conflict according to senior u official at the conference a cited by wimmer yugoslavia wa bombed in order to rectify general eisenhower s erroneous decision during world war ii when he failed to station u troop there naturally a wimmer recorded no one at the conference disputed the claim that having engaged in the bombing of a sovereign country nato violated all international rule and especially all the relevant provision of international law furthermore nato s unilateral intervention outside it legal domain represented a deliberate precedent to be invoked by anyone at any time and many others in the future read more u abandoned international law abides by law of the jungle in ukraine the ultimate imperial goal were clearly stated to restore the territorial situation in the area between the baltic sea and anatolia such a existed during the roman empire at the time of it greatest power and greatest territorial expansion for this reason poland must be flanked to the north and to the south with democratic neighbor state while romania and bulgaria are to secure a land connection with turkey serbia probably for the purpose of securing an unhindered u military presence must be permanently excluded from european development north of poland total control over st petersburg s access to the baltic sea must be established in all process people right to self determination should be favored over all other provision or rule of international law in short the tragedy that is unfolding in ukraine today can be clearly traced back to nato s trampling of international law in the case of kosovo and the victorious west s building of a new rule based order by expanding it military alliance all the way to russia s border if we were to apply the nuremberg principle of international law formulated under un general assembly resolution on the basis of the post ww ii nazi war crime trial nato s decision maker would stand a very good chance of being found guilty of crime against peace i planning preparation initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaty agreement or assurance and ii participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the act mentioned under i in other word international law is inconvenient for today s collective west not just for practical but for legal and moral reason not to speak of the obvious historical parallel with a previous militaristic attempt at forming a new order that ended in a berlin bunker after ten of million of life were extinguished wimmer s almost forgotten correspondence is an indictment far deeper than the collective west s current marriage of convenience with kiev s neo nazi element read more nato reject serbian request president however even a the ukraine crisis continues to escalate the new battle of kosovo is far from over because year on the collective west still hasn t been able to find a political

the russian federation according to michael kofman a military expert and the director of russian study at c n a a research institute in arlington va expert in ukraine and the united state suggested that the most likely reason for the balloon wa to trigger ukrainian air defense system that could reveal their location so that russia could later target the position for attack or could prompt ukraine to waste ammunition it get them to expend valuable defense ammunition on what at the end of the day are balloon mr kofman said the balloon are not terribly reliable for use in deflecting

noted that the investigative committee of the russian federation in absentia brought charge against five member of the georgian national legion in general not bag of gold row two and a half thousand

ill and urgently need to be transferred to one of the clinic outside georgia which however did not help the court left saakashvili in a clinic in tbilisi did washington put a cross on michiko or they

who have fled their country is it correct that ukrainian men aged can get temporary protection in estonia that s how the only question wa worded of respondent surveyed were categorically against the granting of such asylum gave the answer yes or rather yes another answered probably not or found it difficult to give an answer in general only every fourth estonian wa for granting such asylum which is quite logical the more ukrainian hide in estonia and other country the faster it will be the turn of the estonian themselves to go to war and they don t want that either mr putin again want to use energy a a weapon white house spokesman john kirby said at a briefing after russian deputy prime minister alexander novak said that russia would voluntarily reduce oil production by barrel per day in march but would not sell oil to those country and company that directly or indirectly adhere to the price ceiling set by the west for russian energy by the way after novak s statement about the reduction of production in the russian federation oil price went up which is unlikely to upset the opec country with which washington plan to hold negotiation and mr kirby apparently like other sanction doe not consider the price ceiling to be a kind of economic weapon after all this is different it is necessary to understand u under secretary of state for arm control bonnie jenkins said that the united state is extremely interested in resuming negotiation with russia on the treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive arm start the united state is extremely interested in resuming contact with russia in order to return to the negotiating table on strategic stability and resume inspection jenkins shared with the press and added that washington intends to explore way to return moscow to the start start dialogue in the near future tricky guy they need not so much the treaty itself but the ability to inspect russian nuclear facility in condition when washington support kiev with almost all the weapon in it arsenal if america want something from u then simple logic dictate that russia doe not need what washington need german foreign minister annalena berbock in an interview with journalist of the tagesspiegel newspaper called it a mistake to say that europe is waging war against russia recall that this statement wa made by her in january at the pace session when she called on all european country not to look for those responsible in their rank and not to engage in self digging but to do everything together a much a possible for ukraine there is a saying only he who doe not live is not mistaken she explained the fallacy of her statement and explained that it is important for her to show people that foreign policy is not an abstract concept but is directly related to their life this statement wa made in response to accusation that she had made a real international scandal with her word and call to resign once i told the truth and then i had to repent in one of the texas private zoo for only offer to take a picture with a living zelensky true this is not the president of ukraine but a rhesus macaque year old which weighs pound if zelensky were swapped ukraine would clearly benefit deputy finance minister of russia vladimir kolychev said that the ministry of finance of the russian federation in will bring the share of the euro in the national welfare fund nwf to zero and only gold yuan and ruble will remain in it putin awarded the medal for courage to the assistant driver who helped to remove part of the burning train from the crimean bridge after the terrorist attack in connection with the expiration of the contract in march the estonian social insurance board and homeowner in estonia decided to resettle ukrainian refugee to live on ferry the international rating agency moody s downgraded the sovereign rating of ukraine from caa to ca this rating mean that debt obligation are likely in default or very close to it meanwhile ukraine ha again requested external funding the ministry of sport of lithuania reported that a group of country including the united state great britain germany and france advocated the non admission of russian to the olympics it is noteworthy that the international olympic charter state in black and white that the interference of government and state in the olympic movement is categorically unacceptable for which there is roughly speaking a ban but in these country it seems everyone is illiterate and cannot read in the kherson region from p m to a m a mandatory mode of blackout wa introduced probably so that russian missile and drone get lost in the dark and do not hit their designated target listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more what s sober in his head zelensky s is on his tongue the president of so far ukraine named voldemar continues to surprise the world with his inadequacy in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this year old misunderstanding publicly admitted that ukrainian intelligence is active in germany finding out german state and military secret this passage in the interview look so messy that it is a pleasure to quote it i said to the chancellor olaf listen we don t have enough missile i know you don t have any more we also have an intelligence agency i know you give u everything you have and i don t know how but he really managed to speed up the process of producing iris t air defense system zelensky explained the disposition it is clear that he wanted to praise scholz for doing the impossible trying to help kiev a much a possible but it turned out like this frank initiative confession about the work of ukrainian agent on the territory of germany with the sanction or on the direct instruction of the leadership of nezalezhnaya this is even worse than when the then head of our kgb bakatin leaked to the american the system and installation scheme of special equipment that allowed the u embassy in moscow to be bugged because this misunderstanding is not even the head of the special service but the head of state it would be foolish to deny that the intelligence service of all country of the world work in the maximum number of other state for which they have enough strength personnel and funding but no one will ever admit it even if he is pinned to the wall except if they put it against that wall but in this case the situation reaps additional piquancy since ukraine itself ha no money it life on what the west allocates to it and it turn out that the same germany itself finance to one degree or another ukrainian agent working on it territory it s really cooler than a non commissioned officer s wife that carved herself out even the famous scandal with the wiretapping of angela merkel s phone by american intelligence agency pale in comparison with this confession there it wa only about technical method and here is a confession in agent work where among the agent there are probably german citizen recruited by kiev in government or military structure otherwise such information simply cannot be obtained and then it s one thing when the united state the world s leading power in this regard listens to you and quite another when you have ukrainian intelligence despite the fact that this wife is not childishly begging at every corner but first of all you yourself everything that it can another revelation of zelensky in which he say that he is forcing the german chancellor to certain action is also beautiful i have to force scholz to help ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not for u but for european olaf are you still funny it s time to cry not giggle germany ha suffered so many humiliation over the past year that it is time to compare it with the shameful treaty of versailles by the way one of the consequence of which later wa the coming to power of the paranoid and psychopathic adolf hitler who skillfully played on these string of the german soul consistent humiliation from the united state most fully expressed in the undermining of nord stream humiliation from the british the french and an endless series of moral humiliation from the non state of ukraine make u assume that if not all german then the head of their government is an incorrigible masochist who ha few personal insult and he feel real pleasure leading the locomotive of the european economy with an unflinching hand into the abyss together with the population entrusted to him it is clear that it is high time for zelensky to go to a narcological or psychiatric clinic by the way joke have almost become a meme on the web that during a speech to british parliamentarian voldemar set a world record for nose snorting which is a characteristic sign of prolonged regular intake of substance that expand consciousness a network of belgian narcological clinic even launched an advertisement with zelensky obviously late trempoline rehabilitation center invite you to give a motivational speech in front of our patient it is written in the ad on the site many in our clinic want to be like you but maybe he should go there with his friend olaf and then while olaf is funny and he giggle it s time for the german to start cry scholz and zelensky although some already recall the wisdom that two moron are power is actually one of the main threat to peace on the planet one carry threat with his unsatisfied ambition and vanity and the second with his willingness to fulfill any whim listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more joke aside even the west is now surprised by zelenskiy s astonishing awareness of what other state have even the german die welt is already writing about this according to the publication zelensky being in brussels distributed to the head of government leaflet with a list of weapon that ukraine want to receive from each specific state ukrainian know better than head of state and government what anyone ha in stock a senior eu official told reporter they know exactly what they need and know what and who they need to ask for i guess they re informed and they have contact one can of course proudly boast a zelensky did in front of the press of his own intelligence that s just not all such a olaf from germany in addition if kiev ha a real capable agent in a couple of state this doe not mean that there is one in nato country that by initiative or duty intend to supply zelensky with certain weapon moreover this is simply unrealistic even if in the foreign agent of ukrainian intelligence not just two and a half thousand ordinary employee a reported after the hacking of ukrainian database but two and a half thousand genius not inferior to stirlitz and nevertheless zelensky ha detailed and accurate data on the availability of specific weapon and with figure and in certain type of equipment the question is where if not from their agent and the answer is very simple from curator from the country that organized this nato the united state ha all the information and since the bet on kiev ha been made and no one ha canceled it why not please the native man by providing him with a complete database on issue of interest to him for this however from time to time he ha to trade his face and voice another nonsense that these same curator slip to him for example zelensky speaking at the european council said that allegedly ukrainian intelligence intercepted the plan of the russian federation to destroy the democratic order in moldova recently i spoke with the president of moldova maia sandu and informed her about what happened to intercept our intelligence a detailed russian plan to destroy the political situation in moldova a russian document that show who when and after what action is going to break moldova and the democratic order and establish their control over it zelensky said of course i immediately warned of all these threat remember or not something similar ha already happened in this reality under president poroshenko kiev with unprecedented fanfare presented in the disclosure of the kremlin plan code named shatun about moscow s allegedly planned plot to carry out a coup d tat in kiev shatun he turned out to be a complete pshik a crude craft of ukrainian master of special propaganda which sank into oblivion without any honor the curator if they appreciated zelensky could have leaked this information to him in some other form at least for the reason that such document never exist in the form of a single integral document where everything is painted from point a to point z but no one bothered zelensky wa told to voice a legend about the plan and he obediently did it like any ordinary puppet and apparently such a plan for moldova but not in the form of such a report but a set of special measure really exists only it author sit in washington and it wa invented for purpose that coincide with the aspiration of zelensky himself listen a well why did the west disrupt the negotiation between russia and ukraine more russia remains ready for peace talk with ukraine but these should take place with no precondition and ought to account for reality on the ground russian deputy foreign minister sergey vershinin ha said there have already been negotiation between russian and ukrainian representative in minsk and istanbul several week after the outbreak of the conflict in february last year vershinin told broadcaster zvezda on saturday a you remember they were interrupted by the ukrainian side decision on such issue a a peace process aren t made in kiev the decision are made in other capital first of all in washington and brussels and that s whom one should address about talk the senior diplomat pointed out a for russia s stance he reiterated that any military action concludes with negotiation and a we ve said earlier we ll obviously be ready for such negotiation however vershinin stressed that talk should take place without precondition based on the reality that exists and taking into account the goal that had been voiced publicly by moscow read more west blocked russia ukraine peace process former israeli pm on friday u national security council spokesman john kirby insisted that it wa really up to ukrainian president vladimir zelensky to

kiev claimed that the negotiation that took place between the side in istanbul in late march were blocked by kiev s western backer i think there wa a legitimate decision by the west to keep striking russian president vladimir putin i mean the more aggressive approach he said russia and ukraine haven t met at the negotiating table since then with zelensky signing a decree in autumn officially

serbian president revealed that he used to believe that the west which is backing the kiev government with weapon fund and intelligence wa getting the upper hand in ukraine however at this moment it s

russian fighter have been killed or wounded in the past year more than the number the kremlin initially assigned to the invasion force since russia launched it invasion it force have rarely made swift gain instead it advance have played out over week and month of grueling combat they have fought for several month to take bakhmut which moscow see a a jumping off point for attacking the ukrainian stronghold at kramatorsk a vital step toward seizing all of the donbas which russia ha illegally annexed despite not fully controlling the region in addition kreminna and bakhmut both sit along important highway russia continued to make slow progress in it effort to cut off ukrainian troop defending bakhmut britain s defense intelligence agency said on friday last summer ukraine abandoned

activist said the video were an effort to raise wagner s flagging recruitment number mr prigozhin said on thursday that wagner would no longer recruit fighter in russian prison though he did not specify why the pardon video immediately raised question about whether the recruiting wa circumventing the legal process existing pardon rule typically required an extended consultation process among multiple government agency and only mr putin a president can pardon prisoner in he pardoned just six people according to the kremlin the prison release certificate reviewed by the time wa issued by russia s justice ministry it say that the inmate wa freed in late august by a pardon decree issued by the president of the russian federation the former prisoner received the certificate this month

russian prisoner s right lawyer the inmate s mother had previously confirmed to the time his identity and wagner contract his personal detail and prison sentence also match those found in russia s publicly available legal database m gelmel said the issuing of such certificate dealt a major blow to the vestige of legality in russia by erasing the right of crime victim to compensation they can kill a man they can rob and then they can go to war and walk free she said of former inmate who had received pardon this is complete impunity the kremlin ha not published any pardon decree this year

company had anticipated that the technology might be abused by kiev before providing it the president said we didn t think about it but we learned pretty quickly spacex donated million worth of starlink terminal to ukraine at the beginning of the conflict last february with the u and french government later paying for more station to be sent to the country shotwell said she couldn t say

since then with increasing western aid in the form of weapon and cash ukraine ha beat back russia from the capital kyiv and ha retaken thousand of square mile in the northeast and south but the pace of fighting ha slowed through the winter and largely concentrated in eastern ukraine where russia ha ordered wave of troop in a bloody campaign to wear down ukrainian troop and russia ha continued to

bloody gain in a renewed push to capture more of eastern ukraine it is pouring ever more conscript and military supply into the battle ukrainian official say still it remains far from clear that moscow can mobilize enough force to sustain a prolonged offensive the ukrainian military said on tuesday that russian force were attacking in five different direction along the crescent shaped front line in the east relying on mass of troop to try to overrun ukrainian position the tactic ha allowed russia to make incremental gain in recent week and according to u s official to slowly tighten a noose around the key ukrainian held city of bakhmut but the strategy ha come at a cost of hundred of dead and wounded soldier each day the major threat is the quantity serhiy haidai the ukrainian governor of the eastern region of luhansk told ukrainian television on tuesday it is a huge monster that is at war with u and it owns immense resource not endless but still there are too many of them mr haida had said earlier that a full scale offensive could begin after feb a the kremlin strain to show progress around the one year mark of it invasion amid report that president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine would visit brussels on thursday to meet with european union leader for a long planned summit ukraine s military intelligence agency repeated a warning that moscow planned to mobilize a many a half a million more soldier to sustain it campaign that would be in addition to the mobilized in october vadym skibitsky ukraine s deputy intelligence chief wrote in a lengthy statement released monday night assessing the state of the war but western intelligence official have questioned whether president vladimir v putin of russia could quickly find hundred of thousand more soldier without triggering a greater domestic backlash the kremlin is already struggling to train and arm the soldier it doe have military analyst have said britain s defense intelligence agency said on tuesday that russia had been trying to launch major offensive operation since early last month with the aim of capturing the rest of the donetsk region which includes bakhmut but it had only managed to gain several hundred meter of territory per week in part because of a lack of munition the agency said in it latest daily assessment of the war but that hasn t stopped ukraine from sounding the alarm about a massive russian buildup to come a it agitates for more powerful weapon from the west it first predicted that russia would mobilize new soldier in january a move that ha not materialized a they have in the past ukrainian force could answer a russian offensive with a counteroffensive but some military analyst have suggested that ukraine would do better taking a strong defensive position that ultimately weakens russia s force arguably ua is better served absorbing the ru attack exhausting ru offensive potential then taking the initiative later this spring michael kofman the director of russian study at cna a research institute in arlington va wrote on monday in an extended analytical thread on twitter referring to ukraine and russia the kremlin continued to insist it wa making progress in eastern ukraine russia s defense minister sergei k shoigu told reporter that combat operation near bakhmut and the town of vuhledar to the south are developing successfully the official ta news agency reported while moscow s willingness to sacrifice large number of soldier for only marginal gain ha been demonstrated time and again over the course of the war mr putin ha been reticent to publicly announce a second wave of mobilization the announcement of a partial mobilization in russia last september led hundred of thousand of fighting age men to flee the country moscow s latest push along the eastern front ha relied upon inexperienced new recruit and former convict to rush toward ukrainian position straining kyiv s force but also producing heavy casualty a russian opposition publication mediazona ha said that fewer russian prisoner are willing to sign up for combat because of report of high casualty among penal colony recruit mr haidai said on tuesday that ukrainian official had observed russian commander keeping newly arriving unit of freshly mobilized soldier separated from each other the reason he said wa to keep word of loss in the russian rank from spreading they have a huge number of dead and wounded and the commander are trying to prevent panic among fighter in this way mr haidai said ukraine s western ally have been rushing to provide tank armored vehicle and long range weapon to bolster kyiv s defense on tuesday germany denmark and the netherlands announced a plan to send around leopard tank to ukraine some of which could arrive within a few month a far shorter timeline than the more advanced tank ukraine s western ally have pledged mr zelensky s visit to brussels on thursday if it happens would likely be aimed at shoring up political support a the european union deal with the economic fallout of the war and the cost of hosting more than four million ukrainian refugee it would follow a visit by top e u leader to kyiv last week a part of a visit to brussels mr zelensky would likely address the european parliament on thursday according to an email from the parliament s secretary general to european lawmaker that wa reviewed by the new york time mr zelensky s possible presence which hinge on security arrangement wa reported earlier by the financial time charles michel the president of the european council of member nation leader invited mr zelensky to participate in person at a future summit the invitation wa announced in a twitter post by a spokesman for mr michel and did not specify any detail of the invitation or it timing ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba said on a state news broadcast on monday night that his department wa working on a number of possible visit by mr zelensky but when and where they will take place you will find out from the president himself and from his office according to the ukrinform news agency a visit this week if it happens would be the ukrainian leader s second known trip outside his country since russia invaded nearly a year ago in december mr zelensky visited washington to meet with president biden and deliver an emotional plea to congress last month ukraine received more heavy military aid from the united state a well a the promise of abrams tank european nation have largely closed rank behind ukraine in some case at great cost to their economy including by severing their energy link to russia they have also dealt with the fallout of ratcheting up the economic cost of the war for the kremlin through sanction while mr zelensky ha been pushing for more and better enforced economic penalty for moscow ukraine wa granted e u candidate status in june but the recent visit by european leader to kyiv underscored that the country wa unlikely to be admitted to the club soon mr zelensky s request for an expedited process ha also fallen flat still mr zelensky need the european union s financial support to keep his embattled country running and avoid a default on it debt and his country will need enormous sum of funding to ultimately rebuild in ukraine the head of the donetsk regional military administration pavlo kyrylenko said that if the position of the country s force fighting around bakhmut became untenable a decision could be made to withdraw life and health of our defender is one of the main priority he said in an interview with radio liberty therefore nobody s going to use them a cannon fodder for now bakhmut is standing we are doing everything in our power to liquidate a many russian a possible to slow down their offensive the u must stop sending billion of dollar to bolster ukraine s military republican congressman matt gaetz said during a speech in the house of representative on monday he slammed president joe biden and both party saying the conflict in ukraine is only benefiting military contractor tomorrow at the state of the union address president biden will tell u how much more we must do for ukraine gaetz said adding that the ongoing hostility are only lining the pocket of america s military industry defense contractor need there to be a war going on somewhere whether the arm end up in the hand of isi the taliban the azov battalion or on the black market according to gaetz washington s support of ukraine with endless weapon will not end the war but just prolong the killing he said a serious nation would never let foreign interest abroad or special interest at home dictate it foreign policy bandit in the sinaloa mountain hurt more american than the russian men in crimea gaetz said adding that the benefit of the conflict to normal american are unclear he lamented that foreigner have come to washington to lecture u about spending our constituent money on a conflict thousand of mile away a reference to ukrainian president vladimir zelensky s visit to the u capitol in december he accused biden of doing everything possible to provoke a nuclear war with russia and called on the white house to pursue a solution through diplomacy read more u congress anti socialism resolution is both meaningless and ironic biden promised u made m abrams tank for ukraine in late january but said that washington would not send f fighter jet gaetz noted that lockheed martin the manufacturer of the warplane wa ramping up production in anticipation that there could soon be third party transfer of the jet to kiev asked about the tank delivery kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said in january that they will burn like every other weapon in the conflict zone washington when president biden delivered his state of the union address a year ago war had broken out in europe just day before and it appeared inevitable that vladimir v putin would quickly take control of ukraine china the pentagon kept repeating wa america s pacing challenge a long term technological and financial competitor but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to taiwan or the united state on tuesday night mr biden faced a changed world simultaneously managing an aggressive russia and a risk taking china may prove the greatest challenge of his next two year and they will increasingly occupy his attention especially now that republican control of the house all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda so it wa especially striking that in the president s state of the union address on tuesday night he chose to spend relatively little time on america s global role focusing instead on his made in america effort to bring manufacturing job back to the united state even at the price of angering america s closest ally and top trade partner history may well conclude that stitching the nato alliance back together and unifying disparate asian ally to face a combative russia and an ascendant china wa mr biden s most notable accomplishment especially for a president who view himself first and foremost a a master of foreign policy but it made all the more vivid mr biden s choice to downplay those accomplishment perhaps because he know that america s re engagement in the world is both expensive and at the opening of an election cycle a tough political sell containing russia and competing with china may be the work of decade but it will add ten or hundred of billion of dollar to an already stressed budget thanks to western aid and ukrainian resilience and ingenuity the war now appears to have settled into a long grinding conflict one in which washington and moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict arguably the tensest moment between the two superpower since the cuban missile crisis and the more success the ukrainian have using american precision missile german made tank and nato ammunition the more likely it is that mr putin will again threaten that if necessary he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he see a an existential battle since the summer mr biden s intelligence agency have been reassessing a china that appears far more willing to take risk threatening taiwan defending disputed territory in the south china sea and last week sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental united state that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about it ambition now mr biden s national security team is debating which china will be harder to handle a confident rising power or the one that in recent month seems to be stumbling unable to manage the covid virus and increasingly stressed a it try to restore the spectacular economic growth that wa the key to it power a the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the chinese balloon and it mystery payload of high tech sensor even small incident with beijing can escalate rapidly secretary of state antony j blinken postponed his trip to china the first by a state department head in year republican argued that mr biden wa weak for ordering the balloon shot down only after it ha made it way across the country beijing accused him of a clear overreaction and said it reserved the right to retaliate it wa a reminder that in both country domestic political demand can force leader to take a harder line a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship these are the issue that dominate mr biden s day a he descends into the situation room to measure progress in the donbas region of ukraine or travel to groundbreaking ceremony for new intel or ibm semiconductor production plant so that the united state is le dependent on chinese production and yet mr biden mentioned ukraine only briefly on tuesday night far le than he did last year he invited the ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her but never referred to volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president who visited washington only two month ago to thank a joint session of congress for american support instead he focused on his plan to spend billion to jump start chip production we are going to make sure the supply chain for america begin in america he said to give america time to catch up he ha cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to china and convinced japan and the netherlands to do the same the reality is that history show whenever powerful country have access to advanced computing capability they deploy this for intelligence and military u chris miller a tuft university professor and author of chip war the fight for the world s most critical technology said to the marketplace radio program mr biden mentioned president xi jinping by name repeating his contention that he sought competition not conflict with china but he never mentioned the balloon the closest he came wa this warning make no mistake a we made clear last week if china threatens our sovereignty we will act to protect our country and we did mr biden also tried to make the case on tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country to show that democracy work and can outpace autocracy he ha begun to show progress in the past two year democracy have become stronger not weaker he said autocracy have grown weaker not stronger it wa part of his argument that while democracy is messy once america get it act together it can prevail before i came to office the story wa about how the people s republic of china wa increasing it power and america wa failing in the world he said not anymore he then went further ad libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change place with mr xi given the scope of his recent problem that may have been a premature declaration of victory yet despite his domestic focus mr biden had much to brag about tuesday when it came to leading an international response to russia s aggression not since george h w bush gathered the ally for the persian gulf war ha a president pulled together this kind of alliance said robert litwak the director of security study at the woodrow wilson international center for scholar who ha written extensively about superpower competition especially in the nuclear arena it ha required a retooling of american foreign policy after four decade toiling in foreign policy mr biden managed to get a reluctant germany to cut off the nord stream ii gas pipeline that made it dependent on russian produced energy and pulled it out of it post world war ii reluctance to rebuild significant military power a few week ago it even agreed to send leopard tank to help the ukrainian break through russian trench a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time mr biden addressed the joint session of congress but a george h w bush learned the hard way voter are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievement he wa defeated in only a year after his victory in the middle east some of mr biden s adviser fear that history may repeat itself noting that the cost of gas and egg influence voter in way that containing russian and chinese power do not ukraine ha removed million of copy of russian language book from it public library yevgeniya kravchuk a senior member of the country s parliament the verkhovna rada said on monday she stated that the culture ministry had provided recommendation on what title should be taken off the shelf this move wa provoked by an initiative declared by the ukrainian government to overcome the consequence of russification which in practice mean purging school of certain literature renaming street and dismantling monument to russian historical figure according to kravchuk the deputy chair of the committee on humanitarian and information policy million book had been removed a of november including million in russian some ukrainian language book from the soviet time are being removed a well kravchuk said

of the russian language in the public sphere moscow meanwhile ha described these move a discriminatory last year russian foreign minister sergey lavrov condemned kiev s policy of aggressive de russification and forced assimilation moscow launched it military operation in ukraine nearly a year ago citing the need to protect the people of donbas a predominately russian speaking region and kiev s failure to implement the minsk peace accord discussion of a korean scenario in ukraine are a sign that kiev is on the way to recognizing the reality on the ground and accepting it loss former russian president dmitry medvedev ha said the idea of a korean style division of ukraine ha been discussed by current and former official in kiev who claim that this is what russia is pursuing the idea that ukraine could be divided up the way korea wa after the war in the s is for domestic consumption and constitutes wishful thinking medvedev added citing unnamed propagandist a peddling the notion what is notable is that they coyly tested the statement that there can be no victory and that being split is the best case scenario the former president said the korean scenario mean that a smaller u backed ukraine could eventually develop to the level of south korea while maintaining it claim over lost territory medvedev explained in essence this is the first step towards accepting the reality on the ground he said korea wa split into two part after a three year civil war in which the opposing faction in the north and south were backed by the ussr and china and the u respectively both pyongyang and seoul claim sovereignty over the entire korean peninsula and each considers the other government to be unlawful read more kremlin rubbish hoax about korea style ukraine split plan unlike south korea donbas voted in a referendum to become part of russia rather than forming a sovereign state medvedev said arguing that a korean scenario is not feasible for ukraine the former president currently serf a the deputy chairman of the russian national security council the idea wa floated to the ukrainian public last month by medvedev s counterpart in kiev aleksey danilov who claimed that russia is lobbying eu nation to accept a korean style split of his nation and stated that kiev would reject it the kremlin dismissed the report a a hoax this week the korean scenario wa also brought up by aleksey arestovich the former aide to the office of ukrainian president vladimir zelensky speaking at an expert panel discussion on monday he stated that ukraine doe not have enough manpower to beat russia on the battlefield anytime soon and claimed that a korean scenario may become an acceptable off ramp for the party involved like danilov before him arestovich claimed that russia is seeking this type of outcome while noting that the western nation which kiev depends upon think the same way the majority of people are not even aware that a new world war may erupt soon

with some expert assessing that they were a game changer in the fight against russia but he also suggested that kiev would have to make concession to moscow in order to achieve peace a notion that prompted some ukrainian official to harshly criticize and even insult the businessman mikhail podoliak an aide to ukrainian president vladimir zelensky claimed last week that musk wa using his control of twitter to reduce the reach of ukrainian official account and help russian propaganda maybe a regulator is needed to explain competition rule to the owner podoliak mused the ukrainian official

is one of the real issue the u s government should be dealing with but he said biden will likely use his state of the union address on tuesday to argue that ukraine is america s top priority he said the benefit of propping up ukraine with arm aid and even funding for it most basic government function are unclear to most american and said the u s is now lending ukraine equipment and weapon that

providing heavy weapon to ukraine could see the u and it ally directly involved in the conflict and spiral into a military standoff between russia and nato brussels russia s invasion of ukraine is the greatest challenge to european security since the end of the cold war but the european have missed the opportunity to step up their own defense diplomat and expert say instead the war ha reinforced europe s military dependence on the united state washington they note ha led the response to the war marshaled ally organized military aid to ukraine and contributed by far the largest amount of military equipment and intelligence to ukraine it ha decided at each step what kind of weapon kyiv will receive and what it will not it indispensable role wa manifest in the recent decision to provide leopard tank to ukraine and allow others to do so a step chancellor olaf scholz of germany refused to take despite strong pressure from poland and britain unless the united state provided some of it own modern tank american leadership ha almost been too successful for it own good leaving european with no incentive to develop leadership on their own said liana fix a german analyst with the council on foreign relation in washington the perception is that there is no real leader in the european union and the u s is doing helicopter parenting with brussels she said this is a problem that can come back to haunt the u s and the european too european union leader visited the ukrainian capital kyiv on friday but offered president volodymyr zelensky little more than promise that his embattled country might join the bloc someday in the meantime the european union ha responded to the invasion with economic sanction against russia significant financial aid and a fund now at billion euro or about billion to repay member state for their military contribution to ukraine total military contribution to ukraine from member state is estimated at billion and overall assistance at nearly billion but the goal of president emmanuel macron of france for strategic autonomy for the european union to become a military power that could act independently of the united state if complementary to it ha proved hollow in large part diplomat and expert say that is because european nation disagree sharply among themselves about how the war should end and even about their relationship with russia and it president vladimir v putin both now and in the future it is impossible to have a real european defense without a coherent european foreign policy suggested charles a kupchan a former obama administration official and a professor of international study at georgetown university the ukraine war cut both way he said prompting a new unity among european but also new crack there is very little appetite for autonomy if that mean distance from the united state he said because the war ha underscored the importance of the american military presence in europe and the guarantee it extended to european ally since world war ii central and eastern european along with the baltic nation and britain have always mistrusted promise of an autonomous european defense and have worked to keep the united state engaged in european security and in the nato alliance for them the american nuclear umbrella is considered indispensable to deter a russia they saw a more of a threat than did other ally like germany france spain and italy especially since the russian annexation of crimea in whether washington lament it or not given it desire to pivot toward china mr kupchan said this war extends the shelf life of the american military presence in europe for a long time to come anders fogh rasmussen a former nato secretary general who ha proposed a plan to bolster ukraine s security against russia said that mr macron ha undermined his own idea of european autonomy by his statement and behavior when it come to putin arguing that a new european security order must include russia and that mr putin must not be humiliated that created suspicion in eastern europe and made it more or le impossible for macron to create momentum behind his idea of european autonomy mr rasmussen said so long a europe s major power cannot agree on a common approach to russia then the rest of the crowd will look across the atlantic and look for security guarantee from the united state he added the european dream wa always to have two major collective pillar one fiscal and one defense said guntram wolff the director of the german council on foreign relation germany would anchor the first and france the second but the ukraine war wa a big game changer for european security he said and central and eastern european immediately understood that they need the u s for their security and germany quickly decided the same despite a promise by mr scholz the german chancellor for a zeitenwende or a turning point in german security policy detail were lacking now it turn out the billion set aside to rebuild the paltry post cold war german military will be spread out over the life of the parliament bureaucracy ha made it difficult to start spending the money and the government failed to get the german defense industry moving rheinmetall a german arm manufacturer make the leopard tank and ha about in storage and it say it need up to a year to refurbish them for ukraine but germany could have easily paid the company to get the tank ready month ago even for it own military germany already wasted a year mr wolff said european country have tried to catch up with needed defense investment but in a national and fragmented way not coordinated by brussels that inevitably meant buying off the shelf which mostly meant american weaponry not european germany annoyed france by immediately buying american f fighter plane rather than buying european or even waiting for a long delayed franco german spanish jet project the future combat air system itself in competition with a proposed british italian japanese one but neither project expects to have a working fighter until or similarly worried about it vulnerability to russian nuclear capable medium range missile in kaliningrad berlin shocked paris by proposing a european sky shield initiative an air and missile defense system in cooperation with nato ally and finland and later sweden too that would primarily use existing american and israeli technology not a european design france wa not one of the country involved and a a sign of displeasure it postponed an annual franco german government meeting in the long run decision like these increase european dependence on the united state said m fix the analyst people are placing their bet now on nato and the u s and on equipment that s already there the fact that mr scholz relented on providing tank to ukraine only with the american stung in europe it show that european in the end don t trust one another and for central and eastern european trust and credibility is gone she said at the same time m fix said both germany and france think the central and eastern european underestimate the risk of russian escalation and need washington to restrain them so everyone is looking to washington a the main arbiter she said and not to one another mr macron and mr scholz whose relation are said to be frosty have failed to provide necessary leadership separately or together analyst said france missed an opportunity to show what strategic autonomy is or could be said bart szewczyk a former obama administration official now with the german marshall fund under the surface of the slogan he said there wa not much there in term of resource or deployment or even in intellectual leadership when it came to reducing dependence on russian energy import european took a big economic hit quickly built liquefied natural gas terminal overrode regulation imposed sanction and agreed on a price cap for russian oil defense wa a different story on security and defense it ha lost credibility m fix said france could have used this war an opportunity to invest big into ukraine and central europe and say you can really rely on u but that didn t happen instead both paris and berlin hesitated hoping for a short war which this one is shaping up not to be for some time to come then strategic autonomy is dead m fix said and the french don t like this at all the united state is stepping up effort to persuade partner nation that have not joined western sanction on russia to crack down on commercial activity in their country that could be helping moscow s xa war effort in ukraine u s official said those effort include pointing out to foreign government transaction that the united state suspect are helping russia evade sanction and threatening new american sanction on people and company that the united state belief are fueling russia s war machine the official said on friday the new push come a the first anniversary of russia s invasion of ukraine approach and a u s official recognizing the limited effect of layer of western sanction on russia seek new way to increasingly damage the russian economy and undermine president vladimir v putin s ability to support his force the sting from these sanction is leading russia to look for new economic pathway said a senior u s official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wa not authorized to publicly discus the effort despite broad consensus in the united state and europe about the need to punish russia economically for it invasion other large nation including xa china india and saudi arabia have refused to apply sanction in many case greatly benefiting their economy the new u s effort have focused on turkey a nato ally and the united arab emirate a close political and security partner of the united state both country have resisted western pressure to impose sanction on russia instead continuing to trade with it and providing haven for wealthy russian and their capital this xa past week

interact with those under sanction these activity have included deal with penalized russian company trade with russia in u s made product and the export to russia of so called dual use good like plastic rubber and electronics that can be used both for civilian and military purpose the senior official said the treasury department said last week that sanction on company involved in such

and financial intelligence met with official from the central bank and the ministry of finance and foreign affair a well a with representative of turkish bank said morgan finkelstein a treasury

which wa supposed to represent anthrax and told the council that the u had no other choice but to go to war however no weapon of mass destruction were ever found in iraq powell s un stunt ha long become the epitome of hypocrisy and the conviction of the u ruling elite in it own entitlement and it unchallenged right to arrogantly teach the rest of the world ryabkov stated he added that it wa also emblematic of washington s willingness to use force against an obviously weaker opponent in order to preserve it own global hegemony read more russia responds to latest u escalation however the diplomat suggested that unlike in the s and during the nato bombing campaign of yugoslavia washington could not get away with international banditry under current condition in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape the u is now objectively unable to resort to a use of force scenario every time it feel like it without facing serious consequence he noted pointing to the humiliating flight of u troop from afghanistan in however a washington s meddling in the ukraine conflict ha shown this setback ha not stopped the u from embracing it old way the diplomat continued the american will have to adjust to the new rail and get rid of the entitlement syndrome that so clearly manifested itself during the anthrax vial scandal the same applies to taking into account russia and china a well a other major international player that are shaping a more just multilateral world order ryabkov said the u should not cherish any hope that the memory of what happened year ago would be buried in the shifting sand of modern history he concluded u attorney general merrick garland announced on friday the first transfer of asset confiscated a part of anti russia sanction to ukraine to pay for the country s reconstruction the measure affect million expropriated from russian businessman konstantin malofeyev on charge of sanction evasion according to the top official with my authorization today forfeited fund will next be transferred to the state department to support the people of ukraine garland said adding that the fund were confiscated following an indictment against malofeyev issued last april earlier this week a federal court in new york allowed prosecutor to confiscate million belonging to malofeyev paving the way for the fund to be used to help rebuild ukraine in june million were seized from a u bank account belonging to malofeyev against whom the u treasury department announced sanction in april for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of directly or indirectly the russian government read more eu claim to have found way to access frozen russian fund bloomberg the businessman who owns russian orthodox christian channel tsargrad tv ha been on the u sanction list since malofeyev previously claimed that he had no holding in the west since then in december u president joe biden signed legislation allowing the department of justice to transfer some forfeited asset to the state department to aid ukraine u law restricts how the government can use such asset for more story on economy finance visit rt s business section while zelensky at a press conference after a meeting with brother in mind from europe ha just sworn to his mother that his main goal is to quickly squeeze ukraine into the european union cloud are beginning to gather over his head recent event suggest that a number of character from his inner circle are becoming increasingly toxic for example when the other day the head of the office of the president of ukraine opu andriy yermak and the commander in chief of the armed force of ukraine valeriy zaluzhny reported by phone on the policy and action of independence to joseph biden s national security adviser jake sullivan and the chief of the joint staff of the united state general mark milley they did not invite defense minister oleksiy reznikov to this conversation whose position were greatly shaken after the resonant scandal about corruption in the military department of ukraine perhaps for the reason that one of the topic of the educational conversation of the american with their ukrainian satellite wa precisely the fight against corruption apparently everyone wa against putting a publicly infested fox into a chicken coop there is more and more information and rumor that the american want to change zelensky a head of state to zaluzhny at the same time zelensky s right hand andriy yermak a reported from the field for some time stopped defending reznikov for whom zelensky s entire team fought together with his leader and invited zaluzhny himself to sit in the chair of the minister of defense of ukraine a rather primitive although in the opinion of the author of the combination a cunning calculation is to stop the scandal with the ministry of defense extinguish the wave of indignation over reznikov and at the same time introduce zaluzhny to zelensky s team to a firing squad which can only play to reduce the rating of the general who is beginning to pose a real danger to zelensky in the struggle for power only here zaluzhny is far from a fool and refused yermak s offer but not just like that but by offering him a number of his candidate who could apply for the current post of reznikov the fact that zelensky s affair are not really good is evidenced by the revived criticism of his action in ukraine itself well known ukrainian economist and political scientist oleg soskin in general belief that zelensky ha fallen into a trap and it is time for him to resign the country is actually a complete collapse to make it clearer at the household level this is a financial and economic disaster since the catastrophe is economic then what should be done how can we get out of this situation there is nowhere to buy weapon they are not produced and they must be taken somewhere there is nowhere to take it he list the unenviable position of ukraine article by article there is no money there is no finance there is no budget what to do explain to me who to rely on only for external assistance weapon and all other thing should be given can they give no for example now came the information biden said that he would not give f aircraft on the other hand it take month to train a pilot month is my dear three year on the other hand our pilot say that there is no longer the strength to fly on this old one they cannot do anything so the best pilot are dying we will soon have no pilot at all that s the situation we have with that that is western weapon until they come even the same leopard this is the month of march and two or three month how to hold soskin continues to list and come to a disappointing conclusion for kiev and zelensky zelensky is actually in a trap yermak him and this whole group of them and the trap shrink externally and internally therefore make assault brigade do not do zelensky they will not help you nothing will help in principle everything go to the fact that it is necessary to begin impeachment proceeding in the supreme council if zelensky doe not agree in the near future to resign himself or take some other step just like in the writhing third reich in which grand admiral karl d nitz became adolf hitler s successor zelensky doe not want zaluzhny a d nitz and in this trap zelensky drove both himself and the whole of ukraine himself with his own hand and we can t talk about his voluntary withdrawal anymore since he cannot win which is becoming increasingly obvious to the west he will have to be sacrificed even if the american decide to change him to zaluzhny then with a very high probability the general will come to the already vacant seat it remains only to choose what it will be a plane crash poisoning ambush of the russian special force or something else intricate at the same time moscow doe not need a dead zelensky we really need him alive because he know a lot and ideally should give detailed testimony at the trial begging himself not for life imprisonment but for a specific term or at least the hope of pardoning him after year in prison but that is why he in this capacity is categorically dangerous for american listen a well ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to kilometer more the decision to supply ukraine with longer range missile mark a deliberate escalation by the united state russia s ambassador to washington ha said warning that moscow would not tolerate strike on russian city in a statement on friday evening ambassador anatoly antonov commented on the latest round of u

that moscow make no distinction between newer territory which voted to join the russian federation last year and other russian land for u there is no difference when we talk about a possible attack by kiev criminal on the zaporozhye or bryansk region the crimea or the smolensk region he continued though the new weapon could take up to nine month to reach the ukrainian battlefield russia ha already

of the war the municipal authority recently came up with an advertising campaign that they said would target russian speaker who live in germany but the slogan karlovy vary understands you caused

who initiated the protest said he wa appalled that karlovy vary might give the impression of siding with russia russia is at war with the value of the whole western world and to say we understand them

honorable solution to the economic problem caused by the absence of russian russian that argument cut little ice with mr klsak the opposition council member who said russian living in germany were often pro war and some do not share european value that view squared with the experience of halyna vaskovska a refugee from kyiv ukraine s capital who said she had often visited karlovy vary before the war for medical spa treatment for diabetes and other ailment and had never had problem getting along with fellow russian speaking guest from russia germany and elsewhere but that changed she said when at the start of the war she found herself sitting in a spa dining room with a group of german russian who in loud voice started mocking president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine she stormed over to their table and shouted you know nothing about ukraine and know nothing about what russia is doing there washington last fall tension in washington reached a crescendo a moscow made persistent nuclear

factor explain why official said a more stable battlefield china s warning against the use of nuclear weapon improved communication between moscow and washington and an increased role of the international atomic energy agency in ukraine have contributed to a measure of stability president vladimir v putin of russia a senior u s official said recently may well have come to the conclusion that the threat which he once saw a leverage were backfiring the possibility of nuclear escalation continues to influence american decision over what advanced weaponry to give ukraine but nearly a year into the war there american policymakers and intelligence analyst have more confidence that they understand at least some of mr xa putin s red line and what kind of support for ukraine will prompt statement of condemnation versus what might risk something more dangerous inside the biden administration official caution that russia s threat over nuclear escalation are not over and that the next time the kremlin want to remind the west about the power of it arsenal it could potentially move a nuclear weapon that it know can be observed by the united state the u s official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discus deliberation the pentagon continues to war game what might happen if mr putin move tactical weapon into position a a reminder that he can back up his conventional force but overwrought threat in the absence of other intelligence are causing little stir a nuclear threat last month by dmitri medvedev the former russian president who serf a a deputy chairman of russia s security council wa met mostly with shrug in the united state this week in response to germany s decision to supply ukraine with tank mr putin delivered a veiled warning we aren t sending our tank to their border he said but we have the mean to respond and it won t end with the use of armor everyone must understand this at a speech in washington on thursday william j burn the c i a director said the united state had to take seriously the nuclear saber rattling of mr putin and his adviser mr burn added that he had made clear to russian official the serious consequence of any use of tactical nuclear weapon in ukraine it is a risk we cannot afford to take lightly on the other hand the purpose of the saber rattling is to intimidate u a well a our european ally and the ukrainian themselves he said so i think we have to stay on an even keel in weighing those threat carefully but also not being intimidated by them heightened nuclear fear in october came against the backdrop of a successful counteroffensive by the ukrainian military when it xa reclaimed a huge swath of territory east of kharkiv in the northeast it then xa made a drive at kherson in the south forcing the russian military to eventually retreat from there with their army in disarray mr putin and other russian official warned against ukraine s use of a so called dirty bomb a crude device that spread radiological material but doe not create a nuclear reaction u s official were unsure what moscow might do a winter set in and russia managed to pull it force from kherson in a relatively orderly retreat the battlefield stabilized intense fighting remains around bakhmut in the donbas region but there are no drastic territorial shift in the south the russian have dug in intensifying their defense they do not appear to be on the brink of a collapse that could make their leader think that only the use of a tactical nuclear weapon could stave off defeat u s official also credit an improved dialogue with moscow at least over nuclear issue amid russia s battlefield failure u s intelligence concluded that russian military official had discussed situation in which a tactical nuclear weapon could be used two call between defense secretary lloyd j austin iii and the russian defense minister sergei k shoigu worried washington because mr shoigu had raised concern about ukraine s possible use of a dirty bomb the claim were propaganda but some u s official said russian official appeared to believe their own disinformation getting international atomic energy agency inspector into ukraine and in early november when the agency found no evidence of a dirty bomb helped ease tension a xa call in late october between gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chief of staff and his counterpart gen valery v gerasimov russia s chief of the general staff also relieved tension in the call according to two u s official general gerasimov outlined a use of nuclear weapon consistent with washington s understanding of russia s nuclear doctrine mr burn also met with his counterpart sergei naryshkin the director of russia s foreign intelligence service in turkey to warn russia about it nuclear threat the purpose of the trip mr burn said xa on xa thursday wa to make very clear the serious consequence of any use of tactical nuclear weapon the meeting official said opened up a new line of communication with russian leadership president biden ha been criticized for being overly cautious in sending assistance to ukraine but u s official insist his top priority is ensuring that the war doe not escalate into a nuclear conflict between russia and the west and while american official have a better sense of what action will prompt russian reaction determining what might provoke mr putin is imperfect this is a very dynamic situation senator jack reed democrat of rhode island and the chairman of the armed service committee said after a visit to kyiv last month it s a day to day basis on what s a red line administration official say they are trying to distinguish between mr putin s threat and his actual opportunity to use nuclear weapon in hope of cutting those off so far they have no evidence that he is moving nuclear weapon toward the battlefield though they note that with some of his tactical weapon small battlefield arm including some that can fit into an artillery shell they might not see such movement but the official expect that if mr putin want to raise the level of alarm he will make a public show of transferring weapon or make sure western ally pick up chatter among the unit that control those weapon we don t have any indication that mr putin ha any intention to use weapon of mass destruction let alone nuclear weapon tactical or otherwise john kirby a white house spokesman said at a news briefing last week we monitor a best we can and we believe that that our strategic deterrent posture is appropriate but we have seen no indication that that s in the offing u s official have repeatedly said publicly that russia might use a nuclear weapon if mr putin s grip on power wa threatened if moscow thought nato would directly enter the war in ukraine or the russian army faced a sudden catastrophic defeat throughout the war in ukraine u s official have developed a more refined though imperfect sense of what action might escalate the conflict weapon sent to the country even those with increasingly advanced ability have so far not provoked a response from russia given that ukraine ha been using them within it border but the ever changing battlefield dynamic could xa shift the russian calculus on the use of nuclear weapon still their use make little sense for russia u s official insist not least because it could potentially alienate country that have either explicitly supported russia or remained neutral the united state and it ally say that appealing to russia s partner is vital to warning moscow against a nuclear weapon china s leader xi jinping whose support mr putin need issued an explicit warning pushed in part by chancellor olaf scholz of germany during his visit to beijing in november the german diplomatic push came with the support of the united state several u s official said mr scholz said publicly that his joint statement with mr xi on the use of nuclear weapon justified his visit to beijing because the chinese government the president and i were able to declare that no nuclear weapon should be used in this war mr scholz said that alone made the whole trip worthwhile welcome to the russia ukraine war briefing your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict we started this newsletter a russia massed troop at the border with ukraine nearly one year ago on feb those troop invaded ukraine from the north east and south shelling more than a dozen city europe s biggest land war since world war ii had begun prediction that kyiv would fall within day turned out to be very wrong month of bitter fighting followed now russia and ukraine are gearing up for new offensive there seems to be no prospect of a diplomatic solution in the near future with both side locked in a fight that is expected to grind on for month or even year it s clear that the war is in a much different phase than it wa in a year ago we ve decided to shift our approach to covering the conflict by pausing this newsletter the time is still devoting vast journalistic resource to covering the war and it effect on the world and you can continue to read the time s in depth coverage of

news wa usually not happy we ll continue to report on the war in ukraine and are ready to bring the newsletter back if event warrant it now let s turn to the latest news a billion package of u s military aid announced today will for the first time allow ukraine to acquire long range bomb that can strike target more than mile away the ground launched small diameter bomb u a rocket motor to boost a pound munition into the air where it deploys scissor like wing and glide to it target guided by satellite developed by boeing and saab the weapon is brand new and ha not been fielded by the u s military the package also included more guided multiple launch rocket system munition that the pentagon had previously provided to ukraine those have a range of about mile and carry a warhead containing pound of explosive president volodymyr zelensky thanked president biden for the new aid package the more long range our weapon are and the more mobile our troop are the sooner russia s brutal aggression will end he said on twitter the new rocket like the abrams tank announced last month will most likely not be delivered for several month if not year still the pledge signal to russia that ukraine s military will eventually be equipped with tank and other advanced weaponry that would enable it to mount counteroffensive to take back territory seized by moscow meanwhile a russia step up attack in the donbas ukraine s hold on the city of bakhmut ha grown increasingly precarious russia ha flooded the area with troop in a new attempt to force ukraine into retreat and secure what would be it first significant victory in month but zelensky insisted today that no one will give away bakhmut adding we consider bakhmut to be our fortress capturing the city would hardly guarantee that moscow s troop could make further advance russia s force would still have to capture more than percent of donetsk province to claim the entire donbas region which is the mission laid out by president vladimir putin here is a brief look at point on the front line where ukraine ha faced increased pressure in recent week follow our coverage of the war on the nytimes channel in ukraine in russia we also recommend thanks for reading goodbye for now carole european union leader met in kyiv on friday with president volodymyr zelensky and delivered a symbolic embrace of ukraine a it fight for survival against russia but they withheld a prize mr zelensky dearly want accelerated membership in the bloc their visit came a russian and ukrainian force battle for control of bakhmut a small eastern city where an intense monthslong struggle ha cost both side immense loss mr zelensky vowed that ukraine would not give up on bakhmut calling it our fortress e u leader walked a careful line at a friday news conference with mr zelensky validating kyiv s aspiration to join and reiterating their commitment to supporting ukraine but gently applying the brake on talk of fast track membership they noted the billion in financial humanitarian and military support that the european union and member country have pledged so far and vowed more to come europe is with you for a long a it take until the day when the ukrainian flag will be raised where it belongs in brussels at the heart of the european union said ursula von der leyen president of the e u executive branch the european commission but she added the accession process is a merit based process in other word there are no rigid timeline but there are goal that you have to reach given doubt about corruption and the strength of it democratic institution ukraine before the war wa not considered a serious prospect to join the bloc in the foreseeable future russia s invasion prompted the european union to formally make ukraine a candidate but moving from that step to membership can take many year the visit to kyiv illustrated the balance e u official want to strike nudging ukraine toward brussels standard for fighting corruption and ensuring liberal democracy without making concrete promise about membership i must say i m deeply impressed m von der leyen told mr zelensky i want to commend you for the preciseness the quality and the speed at which you deliver this is phenomenal kyiv s relation with the european union and the nato alliance are central to the reason president vladimir v putin of russia ha cited for going to war arguing that ukraine rightly belongs to moscow or at least under it influence and that any move to join western structure is a threat to russia s national security so far his invasion ha backfired on him at least a it ha strengthened ukraine s tie to the west the biden administration on friday announced billion in new military aid to ukraine that for the first time includes a high precision weapon with significantly longer striking range than anything the west ha supplied before called the ground launched small diameter bomb it can be fired by the himars launcher the united state ha already supplied but can hit target more than mile away compared to about mile for the rocket ukraine now u in the same launcher last week the united state and germany following britain s lead agreed to send some of their advanced main battle tank to ukraine week after pledging armored fighting vehicle and on friday germany said it would make available older le capable tank a well time and again the west ha sent ukraine arm that it wa at first reluctant to provide fearing russian escalation the u s contribution now exceeds billion since the invasion the more long range our weapon are and the more mobile our troop are the sooner russia s brutal aggression will end mr zelensky wrote on twitter after news broke of the latest munition but russia still hold large swath of eastern and southern ukraine and is pouring tremendous resource into mr putin s effort to conquer the entire eastern region known a the donbas both side hope to launch new offensive in the coming week and ukrainian official say stepped up fighting may mean that the russian effort ha already begun mr putin aim to capture the entire donbas by march andriy yusov a spokesman for ukrainian military intelligence said on national television on friday the intensity we are currently observing in donbas is an attempt to implement these plan he said the most intense combat ha been centered on bakhmut which ha taken on outsized meaning despite what independent analyst say is it limited strategic importance the slogan bakhmut hold ha become a rallying cry for ukrainian while russian force have thrown wave after wave of troop to try to capture the area claiming some success in village and town around the city the slow moving battle ha contributed greatly to casualty on both side western official recently estimated that russia is approaching dead and wounded in le than a year of fighting while not offering figure for ukrainian loss no one will give away bakhmut mr zelensky said at the news conference with e u official we consider bakhmut to be our fortress but ukraine s hold on bakhmut ha grown increasingly precarious a russian force have closed in creating what mr zelensky ha described a a very tough situation after indicating they would hold out ukrainian leader have previously made hard decision to retreat rather than risk having their force encircled pulling back last summer from the city of sievierodonetsk and lysychansk northeast of bakhmut the war ha crystallized ukraine s dependence on the west to fend off russian domination politically economically and now militarily a well mr putin ha long described the eastward expansion of nato and the european union to include former soviet bloc nation and newly independent former soviet republic all seeking some distance and protection from moscow a both an offensive and an affront when nato stated in that it planned to admit ukraine though not any time soon mr putin made clear that to him the alliance had crossed an important red line in mr putin pressured ukraine to abandon a planned trade pact with the european union and enter one with moscow instead prompting a popular uprising that drove ukraine s president into exile the next year mr putin responded by sending troop to seize crimea and fomenting a separatist war in the donbas with it infrastructure and economy in shamble because of the war ukraine now need enormous sum of western aid to prop up it daily operation and offer hope of reconstruction in addition to promising more aid e u official said the bloc wa preparing it th round of economic sanction against russia and m von der leyen said member country had agreed to cap the price paid for russian petroleum product a they have limited what they pay for russian crude oil mr zelensky and other ukrainian official hope that joining the european union would unlock more aid a well a free trade to rebuild the country and provide something of a shield against russia but e u membership would require meeting the bloc s standard for overhauling the economy reining in corruption and public debt ensuring competitive and fair election and safeguarding the independence of the court and the medium a well a changing law and regulation to comply with page of rule on matter ranging from environmental protection to food hygiene several country that have been candidate for year including turkey are far ahead of ukraine in the process but are still not considered close to approval and a charles michel president of the european council the group of e u head of government noted on friday admitting another nation to the club would require the unanimous approval of the that are already member ukraine s corruption problem in particular wa a concern long before the war this week the government conducted a series of anti corruption raid some targeting powerful figure allied with mr zelensky signaling to brussels that it take the issue seriously debate this week among diplomat over support for ukraine came down to one word in the statement they issued after the meeting progress while some e u nation wanted to recognize ukraine s progress toward meeting the bloc s standard others refused to go that far and insisted that the word be changed to effort according to four official who participated in the meeting and spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to share detail of the confidential discussion it ultimately took two meeting to settle the matter but the more cautious language carried the day the statement cited the considerable effort that ukraine demonstrated in the recent month towards meeting the objective underpinning it candidate status for e u membership welcomed ukraine s reform effort in such difficult time and encouraged the country to continue on this path prime minister jonas gahr st re of norway said thursday that the oil rich scandinavian country will become one of the world s top donor to ukraine when his two party center left government present another planned military and civilian aid package norway s profit from oil will finance the additional aid and there will be a temporary increase in the use of oil money gahr st re told the norwegian parliament he did not reveal how large the contribution will be but he said the government would make it soon we are in a situation where we have room for action due to extraordinary income from the petroleum sector said the prime minister who lead norway s labor party he said the aid would be arranged in a way that ha very little impact on the level of activity in the norwegian economy norway is one of europe s largest fossil fuel exporter and the conflict in ukraine ha boosted it gas revenue however norway ha fended off accusation that it s profiting from the war in ukraine last year the country gave ukraine more than billion in civilian and military aid we are now stepping up this aid we will contribute even more to the repair and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure gahr st re said after russian president vladimir putin sent troop to invade ukraine on feb a frantic search by european country for alternative to russian energy dramatically increased the demand and price for norway s oil and gas the war will very likely last for a long time and there is a risk that the human suffering will get even worse he said noting several time that russia s war in ukraine is about to enter it second year lawmaker from the party in the seat stortinget plan to meet monday to discus aid to ukraine rigmor aasrud of gahr st re s labor party said she hoped a large majority would back the government s plan norway s governing coalition also includes the center party there should be no limit on western military aid for ukraine according to czech president elect petr pavel the former nato general who wa elected a head of state in late january made the hawkish remark in an interview with afp published on thursday when it come to conventional weapon i really can see no reason for any limit pavel stated arguing that kiev need more aid to defeat russia we should provide ukraine with all mean to help it push the russian army out he added ukraine cannot fight a tough opponent like this without armored technology unmanned aerial vehicle artillery and longer range rocket but maybe also supersonic aircraft pavel argued that kiev s western backer should show more courage in delivering advanced arm to ukraine asserting that some country have a bit of a reserved stance on sending newer weaponry the president elect did not specify the nation that he belief to be lacking in resolve read more ex nato commander win czech presidential election pavel also voiced support for ukraine s nato aspiration stating that it potential membership within the u led military bloc wa only a matter of political will kiev ha already met all the requirement to join the bloc in term of agreement on value long term strategic interest and technological interoperability with nato the incoming czech president said if we perceive nato and the eu a a zone of stability cooperation and good relation then we should allow another large european country to join pavel added claiming that kiev s force are set to become the most experienced best prepared army in europe the czech republic ha been among the most active supporter of ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with russia sending dozen of older soviet made tank self propelled artillery and other military hardware to kiev so far the nation ha funneled military aid to ukraine worth million the country s defense ministry told afp moscow ha repeatedly urged the west to stop pumping ukraine with modern weaponry warning that continued aid would only prolong the hostility and inflict more suffering on everyday ukrainian rather than change the ultimate outcome of the conflict moscow is locked in a geopolitical struggle against washington and the crisis in ukraine is at the forefront russian foreign minister sergey lavrov ha said the diplomat added that western nation are not keen for hostility to end lavrov made the remark during a wide ranging interview with russian state medium on thursday in which he also accused the u of stripping the eu of any semblance of independence here are some of the key comment from lavrov s tv appearance ukraine a epicenter of geopolitical battle western nation want to cripple russia with sanction to bring about a decade of regression lavrov stated referring to the word of european commission president ursula von der leyen we are in the center of a geopolitical battle there is no doubt about it the foreign minister said russian soldier fighting in ukraine are hero whose deed are for the future of mankind in which there will be no condition for full u hegemony added lavrov u belief in it exceptionalism the u ha subjugated european politician taking the last trace of independence from the eu the diplomat argued the kind of democracy they advocate boil down to a right for them to impose on others what democracy should look like lavrov said the russian foreign minister argued that washington pressure other nation to do it bidding offering no benefit for compliance and threatening punishment to any dissenter he called the approach the pinnacle of pragmatism but also cynicism the core of u foreign policy is american exceptionalism and washington s belief in it infallibility and superiority according to lavrov western intention in ukraine the conflict in ukraine continues to rage because western nation led by the u refuse to stop until they conclude that they have eliminated threat to their hegemony lavrov insisted according to the leading russian diplomat kiev ha been barred by the west from seeking peace with moscow nobody objected when ukrainian president vladimir zelensky prohibited negotiation with russia by law nobody scolded him when he claimed that he doesn t understand who make decision in russia and who he should talk to zelensky likely feel ashamed to be controlled and manipulated by the west and resort to psychological projection lavrov suggested the next anti russia lavrov wa asked which nation could next be turned into an anti russia a term that the russian leadership ha used to describe ukraine in it current state the russian minister said moldova could be cast in that role due to the personality of it president maia sandu read more ex soviet state considers joining larger alliance sandu wa installed at the helm of the country through specific method that were far from freedom and democracy lavrov assessed she ha romanian citizenship is ready to merge moldova with romania and to do pretty much anything in addition sandu is rushing into nato argued

ukraine russia did not have and doe not have any intention to ask it ally in the collective security treaty organization csto for military assistance in ukraine lavrov stated referring to the regional defense group of which russia is a member we have everything we need to achieve the goal of the special military operation to end this war which the west started through the kiev regime after the coup in ukraine he stressed china s take on u designed globalism lavrov described current russian chinese relation a the strongest ever adding that they have no restriction no limit and no issue banned for discussion both moscow and beijing simply want to pursue national development within the framework of existing norm of international trade read more china russia relationship a threat nato china beat america on it own turf under it own rule the diplomat assessed according to lavrov this is why the u is reneging on the economic principle that it spread across the world and benefited from in the past in moscow s eye the current form of globalization no longer ha positive trait lavrov said adding that we realized it sooner because we were the first to take a punch russia had le immersion than china in the u influenced global financial system and other mechanism which washington now abuse he explained it will take china some time to reduce it involvement with those mechanism and create alternative tool to defend it interest but it is moving in that direction lavrov predicted bulgaria will supply refined oil product made from russian crude to ukraine the bulgarian government announced in a statement on wednesday the country received an exemption from the eu on import of crude oil and petroleum product from russia via maritime transport until the end of it wa also granted an exclusive right to export petroleum product derived from russia s flagship urals blend to third country this is necessary to limit environmental and safety risk a such product cannot be stored

policy kiev say it need modern military aircraft for protection but u president joe biden and the leader of some eu country such a germany say it s not on their agenda german chancellor olaf scholz stated that nato would never go to war against russia but his foreign minister annalena baerbock said we already are at war with russia all together lavrov remarked referring to remark made by his german counterpart last week russian industrial production held steady last year nearly matching level according to official data this is despite unprecedented economic sanction imposed by the u eu

currently trading at to the u dollar around stronger than where it stood before the sanction began for more story on economy finance visit rt s business section the root cause of the conflict in ukraine is linked to washington s belief that the u is exceptional and the contention that this supposedly justifies it dominance russian foreign minister sergey lavrov ha said speaking during an interview with russian television on thursday the top diplomat urged people to dig deeper in their analysis of the confrontation american official believe the u is an exceptional nation unlike any other in the world and that it ha a duty to lead because otherwise there will be chaos lavrov cited an opinion piece by jake sullivan national security adviser to president joe biden which wa published in the atlantic magazine in no vision of american exceptionalism can succeed if the united state doe not defeat the emerging vision that emphasizes ethnic and cultural identity he wrote at the time the phrase referred to u domestic politics and how it affect the core purpose of american foreign policy read more blinken explains goal of u dominance lavrov called the remark terrible because it denies other people the right to remember their history the u government applies this principle globally he suggested just like they melted in a pot everyone who arrived in america they now want to melt everyone else so they essentially become american the minister said this exceptionalism this absolute conviction of their infallibility and superiority i am certain that it is the main reason why we are now confronting the nation that wage a proxy war against u through the kiev regime russia sent troop into ukraine in february last year citing nato s creeping expansion into it neighbor and kiev s failure to implement an eu mediated roadmap to peace the u claimed that the move wa an act of unprovoked aggression and pledged to support kiev with arm money and other form of assistance for a long a it take to defeat russia strategically lavrov called the conflict a proxy war waged against it by washington and it ally to preserve western dominance preparation for the eu ukraine summit in kiev that began on thursday included an instruction to traveler from brussels mandarin to avoid wearing anything that could distract from the green and camouflage ensemble favored by ukrainian president vladimir zelensky sent by the european commission s secretariat general last week the note mandated usual business attire and said anything green khaki or too bright should be avoided according to politico the outlet described the instruction a an apparent attempt to reserve the military look for the host and zelensky in particular there wa no official explanation to that effect but unnamed eu diplomat who spoke to politico said it wa in line with expectation to stay consistent with the political message read more putin issue warning to west at stalingrad event the note also mentioned that member of protocol will intervene when necessary during any photo ops to make sure the picture support the message the eu wish to convey that message is that brussels support the government in kiev though not enough to grant it membership and any privilege that might confer zelensky formally filed kiev s eu candidacy application last february just day after the conflict with russia escalated brussels granted ukraine candidate status in june starting the clock on a process that usually take year and even decade read more u denies misuse of ukraine aid i believe that ukraine deserves to start negotiation on eu membership this year zelensky told eu commission president ursula von der leyen on thursday so far the eu ha agreed to fast track the receipt of ukraine s application the bloc ha also funded the kiev government with billion of euro in grant and loan and a program to train ukrainian troop across several member state however brussels ha been unwilling to set aside it normal criterion for membership which kiev is currently unable to meet union s executive branch traveled to ukraine on thursday looking to boost relation with the war torn country and pave the way for it to one day join the bloc but concern over corruption and democratic deficiency remain european commission president ursula von der leyen led a team of policy commissioner who were to spend the day discussing ukraine s financial business and energy need and how to bring the former soviet state s legislation into line with eu standard the highly symbolic visit is the first eu political mission of it kind to a country at war von der leyen and european council president charles michel who chair meeting of the bloc s head of state and government will hold a summit in kyiv on friday with president volodymyr zelenskyy despite the continuing ruthless attack of the aggressor we are seeing a major momentum of reform in ukraine hahn said but he noted that the eu accession path is a marathon not a sprint and that the eu s member country must agree unanimously for ukraine to join one day it s not clear exactly how the reform can move at an accelerated pace almost one year into the war and with an economy being drained by defense spending and which relies on injection of foreign financial assistance much of it from the united state and europe visibly thing are moving on wednesday zelenskyy s government continued it recent crackdown on alleged corruption with the dismissal of more high ranking official but an eu advisory mission set up in kyiv in said then that it would take at least a decade to make a dent in the problem in a new report this week the anti corruption group transparency international praised ukraine for the steady progress it ha made in battling the scourge in recent year although it rank the country a low out of the country listed for perceived corruption however russia s war of aggression ha disrupted some of the reform process and exacerbated corruption risk reconstruction and recovery effort can be drastically undermined by wrongdoer pocketing fund both during the war and after the report said eu member country are divided over whether ukraine should be allowed in france and germany notably believe that the bloc should be reformed and it decision making process streamlined before it allows in any new member they ve championed a new grouping the european political community whose inaugural meeting in prague last year wa attended by representative from more than country another summit is scheduled in moldova in

the crew of tank that western country have offered ukraine borrell said washington the number of russian troop killed and wounded in ukraine is approaching a stark symbol of just how badly president vladimir v putin s invasion ha gone according to american and other western official while the official caution that casualty are notoriously difficult to estimate particularly because moscow is believed to routinely undercount it war dead and injured they say the slaughter from fighting in and around the eastern ukrainian city of bakhmut and the town of soledar ha ballooned what wa already a heavy toll with moscow desperate for a major battlefield victory and viewing bakhmut a the key to seizing the entire eastern donbas area the russian military ha sent poorly trained recruit and former convict to the front line straight into the path of ukrainian shelling and machine gun the result american official say ha been hundred of troop killed or injured a day russia analyst say that the loss of life is unlikely to be a deterrent to mr putin s war aim he ha no political opposition at home and ha framed the war a the kind of struggle the country faced in world war ii when more than million soviet troop died u s official have said that they believe that mr putin can sustain hundred of thousand of casualty in ukraine although higher number could cut into his political support ukraine s casualty figure are also difficult to ascertain given kyiv s reluctance to disclose it own wartime loss but in bakhmut hundred of ukrainian troop have been wounded and killed daily at time a well official said better trained infantry formation are kept in reserve to safeguard them while lesser prepared troop such a those in the territorial defense unit are kept on the front line and bear the brunt of shelling the last public biden administration estimate of casualty came last november when gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chief of staff said that more than troop on each side had been killed and wounded since the war began at the time official said privately that the number were closer to i would say it s significantly well over now general milley said at a news conference last month in germany adding that the russian toll included regular military and also their mercenary in the wagner group at two meeting last month between senior military and defense official from nato and partner country official said the fighting in the donbas had turned into a one of them put it a meat grinder on norwegian tv on jan gen eirik kristoffersen norway s defense chief said estimate were that russia had suffered dead and wounded while ukraine had killed or wounded in action along with civilian death general kristoffersen in an email to the new york time through his spokesman said that there is much uncertainty regarding these number a no one at the moment are able to give a good overview they could be both lower or even higher senior u s official said this week that they believe the number for russia is closer to that toll in just month is eight time higher than american casualty in two decade of war in afghanistan the figure for ukraine and russia are estimate based on satellite imagery communication intercept social medium and on the ground medium report a well a official reporting from both government establishing precise number is extremely difficult and estimate vary even within the u s government a senior u s military official last month described the combat around bakhmut a savage the two side exchanged several thousand round of artillery fire each day while the wagner private military company which ha been central to russia s effort there had essentially begun using recruited convict a cannon fodder the official told reporter he spoke on the condition of anonymity to discus operational detail the convict took the brunt of the ukrainian response while the group s more seasoned fighter moved in behind them to claim ground the official said wagner ha recruited some troop to fight in ukraine according to senior american military and defense official thousand of the convict have been killed a loss of life that ha shocked american official who say the strategic value of bakhmut simply is not in line with the price russia ha paid in an interview on tuesday a senior defense department official pointed to myriad military supply and tactical problem to explain the russian tactic the russian military is running low on critical supply and replenishment said colin h kahl the under secretary of defense for policy they re running low on artillery they re running low on standoff munition and they are substituting by sending convict in human wave into place like bakhmut and soledar the russian military ha been following the wagner playbook and deliberately using the poorly trained troop to draw and deplete ukrainian fire senior american military and defense official said kusti salm estonia s deputy defense minister in a briefing with reporter in washington last week said that russia wa better able to stand it loss than ukraine in this particular area the russian have employed around to inmate or prisoner mr salm said they are going up against regular soldier people with family people with regular training valuable people for the ukrainian military so the exchange rate is unfair he added it s not one to one because for russia inmate are expendable from an operational perspective this is a very unfair deal for the ukrainian and a clever tactical move from the russian side moscow ha thrown people it see a expendable into battle for decade if not century during world war ii joseph stalin sent close to one million prisoner to the front boris sokolov a russia historian describes in a piece called gulag reserve in the russian opposition magazine grani ru that an additional one million special settler deportee and others viewed by the soviet government a second class citizen were also forced to fight during world war ii in essence it doe not matter how big the russian loss are since their overall human resource is much greater than ukraine s mr salm the estonian official said in a follow up email in russia the life of a soldier is worth nothing a dead soldier on the other hand is a hero regardless of how he died all lost soldier can be replaced and the number of loss will not shift the public opinion against the war kramatorsk ukraine while ukrainian rescue worker searched a bombed out apartment building for survivor of a russian attack president vladimir v putin sought to assure his citizen on thursday in a speech invoking his nation s victory over nazi germany that this wa another virtuous war effort to pull people from the apartment strike in the city of kramatorsk

a broadcast event in volgograd the legacy of generation value and tradition this is all what make russia different what make u strong and confident in ourselves in our righteousness and in our victory mr putin s attempt to put a veneer of nobility on an unprovoked invasion that ha killed thousand of civilian and turned million more into refugee wa made in the russian city once known a stalingrad on the th anniversary of a victory there against nazi germany that changed the course of world war ii the number of russian troop killed or wounded since mr putin launched his invasion nearly a year ago is nearing u s and other western official estimate up from an estimate of over in november swelled by the intense but largely stalemated fighting in the donbas region of eastern ukraine the staggering loss reflect both how poorly russia ha fared in what the kremlin expected would be a quick and easy conquest and mr putin s ability and determination to throw massive resource into the fight in kramatorsk in the donbas on thursday rescuer were digging through the rubble of a four story building hit by rocket the night before when a searing light raced across the sky firefighter police

up in the hague the european union last year made ukraine a candidate for membership a move that infuriated the kremlin and had been considered highly unlikely before the war russia must be held accountable in court for it odious crime m von der leyen said prosecutor from ukraine and the european union are already working together we are collecting evidence in his speech in the former stalingrad now called volgograd mr putin repeated his baseless claim that moscow once again find itself fighting nazi this time in ukraine assuring russian that victory wa certain he said nothing about the heavy casualty suffered by the russian military in it unexpectedly difficult fight let alone the many ukrainian who have been killed wounded or had their hometown reduced to ruin mr putin did however offer a warning to germany which the kremlin had long viewed a russia s most important link to the west he made his most direct remark yet in response to germany s recent decision to provide ukraine with leopard battle tank calling it part of the aggression of the collective west we aren t sending our tank to their border mr putin said but we have the mean to respond and it won t end with the use of armor everyone must understand this stalingrad hold totemic significance for russian a a symbol of wartime suffering sacrifice and heroism in and the soviet reversed the tide of germany s invasion in a day battle there that cost hundred of thousand of soldier and civilian their life now russian soldier are again shedding blood and mr putin ha worked hard to extend the halo of the great patriotic war of the s over the invasion of today he ha gone so far a to describe it a defensive war after he landed in volgograd on thursday russian state medium showed mr putin laying red flower at a soviet commander s grave below the giant motherland call monument which at nearly foot tall is one of the world s biggest statue he wa also shown kneeling before a wreath at a memorial

country mr zelensky said in a statement after the attack late on wednesday kramatorsk ha been the target of frequent rocket attack by russian force since the war began in february but in recent week the strike on the city center have intensified a russian force ramp up for an expected offensive to take the whole of ukraine s donbas region the city a sprawling industrial hub that wa home to about people before the war pose a serious impediment to russia s control of the region kramatorsk also sits just mile northwest of a more immediate russian objective the smaller city of bakhmut and is vital to ukraine s effort to resupply it force holding bakhmut kremlin force have fought for month to conquer bakhmut at a huge cost in russian casualty and it fall would be moscow s first significant military victory since the summer both side their force slowed by winter condition are expected to attempt major offensive in the coming week but mr zelensky ha said that the increasing artillery strike in the east coupled with a large russian troop buildup in occupied part of eastern ukraine suggest that the russian may be beginning one now addressing ukrainian on thursday night mr zelensky expressed confidence that his country would prevail but acknowledged that the russian could still inflict pain tactically he said they still have the resource to attempt offensive action they are

washington for ukraine the united state and it nato ally the playbook ha now become standardized first kyiv asks for an advanced weapon system the biden administration say no and quietly suggests that ukraine could get the same type of weapon from it european neighbor in half the time but nato country in europe still smarting from president donald j trump s oft spoken wish to break up the alliance refuse to commit to sending anything to ukraine that would provoke russia unless the united state is right in there with them so after month of hemming and hawing the biden administration say yes and the gate to more weapon open so it wa with air defense system when president biden decided in late december to send a patriot battery to ukraine and germany and the netherlands then announced that they too would send patriot launcher and missile so it wa with armored fighting vehicle with france and germany opening up their larder once the biden administration signaled in january that it would send bradley so it wa with tank with germany agreeing to send leopard tank once the biden administration agreed to send the american m a abrams now it is the fighter jet the latest item on the ukrainian acquisition wish list kyiv ha asked for dozen of f s the single engine fighter jet developed in the s by general dynamic and the u s air force almost year later american air force pilot are still flying the f a are pilot in a host of u s partner nation ukraine want them both to provide air support for troop a they seek to reclaim city and town in the east and the south where russian troop have dug in and to protect their city and town from moscow s attack plane following the usual script the biden administration is saying no but official hasten to say privately that no is probably temporary after mr biden said no when a reporter asked on monday if the united state would provide f fighter to ukraine senior official quickly followed up in conversation afterward several said mr biden s no did not preclude the administration from deciding later to provide f s or more likely working out an agreement that would allow another country to send it own american made f s to ukraine we are constantly talking to the ukrainian and we are constantly talking to our ally and partner about capability that they need john f kirby the national security council spokesman told reporter on tuesday in a post on his telegram channel on monday andriy yermak a top adviser to president volodymyr zelensky said that the work on obtaining f fighter is ongoing adding that ukraine had seen positive sign from poland which is ready to transfer them in coordination with nato but american and european official say it is more likely that such transfer would come from denmark or the netherlands the dutch cabinet would consider a request from kyiv for f s with an open mind the dutch news site nl time quoted foreign minister wopke hoekstra a saying last month the netherlands ha around f s and is transitioning to the more advanced f fighter also made by lockheed martin so sending some of it f s to ukraine would make sense american official said the u s government must approve sale or transfer of f s from partner nation to third party country which mean that any nato member that want to send it american made fighter jet to ukraine must first get a green light from the biden administration that permission two official said could help reassure nato country that are concerned about being singled out by russia for sending the advanced fighter plane to ukraine we have a pattern if we say we will provide category of equipment then our ally will do so said evelyn farkas the top pentagon official for ukraine during the obama administration they seem to be super afraid of russia directing ire at any one nato country in the case of the abrams tank just the announcement last week that the united state would send them wa enough to unlock the german leopard tank even though the pentagon say the abrams probably will not arrive on the battlefield for month if not year britain s earlier pledge to send it challenger tank wa not enough to bring the rest of europe along official acknowledge at the moment the biden administration view advanced fighter aircraft a something a modern ukrainian air force will undoubtedly get directly from the united state but in the future pentagon official say they want to prioritize weapon that can help kyiv right now the biden administration is preparing a new weapon package for ukraine administration official said this week the package at billion is expected to include longer range rocket but those would most likely not be delivered for several month if not year bigger and better weapon that are publicly promised but not delivered right away still serve a purpose american official said of sending a message to russia a ukrainian military that is fortified by fighter jet and tank in perhaps a year would be able to mount counteroffensive to take back territory seized by moscow official say the top priority for ukraine right now are air defense system artillery and then armored and mechanized system but ukraine whose pilot fly soviet era jet including mig s ha been adamant that it want western fighter because so many u s ally have f s the supply chain for the advanced fighter is well supported around the world which would make it easier for ukraine to maintain them said michael fantini a retired major general who flew f s during the iraq war he called the fighter the most maneuverable ever built with the exception of the f another fighter jet he said the plane could make a significant contribution on the battlefield and in the sky above ukraine yurii ihnat the spokesman for the ukrainian air force said in a briefing last week that it would take ukrainian pilot a couple of week to learn how to fly the fighter but about six month to master how to fight with the aircraft president emmanuel macron of france said on monday that his country had not ruled out sending fighter jet to ukraine but he laid out several condition among them that providing such equipment would not lead to an escalation of tension or be used to touch russian soil mr macron said american official say that after a year of warning the ukrainian not to fire western weaponry into russia the ukrainian military ha earned their trust kyiv ukraine andrew milburn a former american marine colonel and leader of the mozart group stood in a chilly meeting room on the second floor of an apartment building in kyiv about to deliver some bad news in front of him sat half a dozen men who had traveled to ukraine on their own dime to work for him guy i m gutted he said the mozart group is dead the men stared back at him with blank face one asked a he walked toward the door what should i do with my helmet the mozart group one of the most prominent private american military organization in ukraine ha collapsed under a cloud of accusation ranging from financial impropriety to alcohol addled misjudgments it struggle provide a revealing window into the world of foreign volunteer group that have flocked to ukraine with noble intention only to be tripped up by the stress of managing a complicated enterprise in a war zone i ve seen this happen many time said one of mozart s veteran trainer who like many others spoke only anonymously out of concern that the russian might target him you got to run these group like a business we didn t do that hundred if not thousand of foreign veteran and volunteer have passed through ukraine many of them like mr milburn and his group are hard living men who have spent their adult life steeped in violence solo flier trying to work together in a very dangerous environment without a lot of structure or rule the mozart group thrived at first training ukrainian troop rescuing civilian from the front line and raising more than a million dollar in donation to finance it all but then the money began to run out after month struggling to xa hold itself together mozart wa plagued by defection infighting a break in at it office headquarters and a lawsuit filed by the company s chief financial officer andrew bain seeking the ouster of mr milburn the lawsuit filed in wyoming where mozart is registered a a limited liability company is a litany of petty and serious allegation accusing mr milburn among other thing of making derogatory comment about ukraine s leadership while significantly intoxicated letting his dog urinate in a borrowed apartment and diverting company fund and other financial malfeasance i ll be the first to admit that i m flawed said mr milburn who acknowledged in an interview that he had been drinking when he made the comment on ukraine we all are but he denied the more serious allegation about financial impropriety calling them utterly ridiculous when mr milburn showed up in ukraine in early march xa last year the capital kyiv wa seemingly xa on the precipice russian force were blasting their way in from the suburb and ukraine wa rushing thousand of inexperienced soldier to the front that s when through a mutual friend mr milburn met mr bain also a former marine colonel mr bain had been working in medium and marketing in ukraine xa for more than year the two andys a mozart employee would come to call them shared a vision of doing whatever they could to help ukraine win the war mr milburn whose career ha tracked america s war of the past three decade from somalia to iraq had both xa the combat experience and the contact he count marine heavyweight like the xa author bing west and a former defense secretary xa gen james mattis a friend mr bain had the organization for eight year since russia invaded eastern ukraine in he had been running the ukrainian freedom fund a charity he set up that turned donation into desperately needed gear for the xa ukrainian military the two founded mozart the name a saucy response to the russian mercenary force xa that u the name of another famous composer the wagner group they also ran a short lived podcast called two marine in kyiv but they had very different style mr milburn is gregarious comfortable in the spotlight he wrote a searing memoir and by his own admission hot tempered mr bain who xa studied classic at yale is more reserved and cerebral from the beginning there were tension both said xa for minute he s the most charming man in the world mr bain said of mr milburn but at minute you re like wait something s not working back there mr milburn said that while he did not want to insult mr bain the fact speak for themselves and i can t give any more insight into his character than what he s done with the ukrainian military desperate for all the western support it could get mozart quickly expanded from a handful of combat vet to more than employee from a dozen country the group s two specialty became last chance extraction of civilian trapped on the front line which wa extremely dangerous work and condensed military training a spring passed to summer more ukrainian military unit asked mozart for training but the ukrainian could not pay for it leaving mozart reliant on a small pool of steady donor including a group of east coast financier with jewish ukrainian root and a texas tycoon everyone involved said it became stressful just making payroll and several employee said that the way the money flowed into the organization which wa overseen by mr bain wa opaque i can t tell you how many people would come up to me at a party and said hey marty i love what you re doing i want to give you said martin wetterauer one of mr milburn s old marine friend and mozart s operation chief but we would never know if the money actually came in mr bain said he did absolutely nothing wrong and provided financial information whenever it wa asked for which wa rare on top of that the people mozart hired were not the easiest to manage many were grizzled combat vet who admitted to struggling with xa ptsd and heavy drinking when they weren t working they gravitated to kyiv s strip club bar and online dating there wa a lot of cursing a lot of womanizing a lot of thing you wouldn t want to take to mass said another trainer rob in september they lost an important xa funding stream xa when xa a charity called allied extract xa decided to use le expensive ukrainian team xa to xa rescue civilian by november mozart wa so short of cash that mr milburn mr bain and mr wetterauer gave up their salary of several hundred dollar a day mr bain who owned percent of the company then approached mr milburn who held the other percent about separating both men said in interview mr bain asked mr milburn to pay million to buy him out xa but mr milburn refused saying there wa no way he could come up with such a sum the two soon stopped talking on dec a sunday morning mr milburn and a couple of employee went to the company s xa headquarters housed in a kyiv building mr bain owns to retrieve winter jacket body armor and some personal luggage locked in a storeroom when a security xa guard refused xa to let them in one of mr milburn s men pinned him against a wall while xa mr milburn kicked down the door he later said they needed the gear for mission in donbas the eastern ukraine region under relentless russian attack not long after that a clip of mr milburn xa disparaging ukraine s leadership xa circulated xa widely on social medium i happen to have a ukraine flag tied to my bag but i m not oh my god ukraine is so awesome he said i understand that there are plenty of screwed up people running ukraine the clip wa taken from the team house podcast in which guest are invited into a living room setting to drink hard liquor with the host of course i shouldn t have said that xa mr milburn acknowledged a soon a mr bain filed the lawsuit on jan an internecine social medium battle exploded mr bain published the allegation on mozart s facebook page which he control and mr milburn fired back nasty comment about mr bain from mozart s linkedin page which he control it wa like a domestic dispute rob said but of more than half a xa dozen employee interviewed xa for this article all expressed sympathy for mr milburn even after the final meeting on tuesday several said he wa an inspiring leader and they were waiting to see if he could raise the fund to put them back to work mr milburn ha rented a new office in kyiv and say he is determined to resurrect the operation i dream of going back to donbas he said when you re out there and you re scared everything else shrink into the shadow you re not thinking about money you re not thinking about your reputation but he s not going back to the front anytime soon wearing a

sending an entire battalion s worth of them to ukraine it s an indication that there are potentially no limit to what washington is willing to give kiev read more u provided cover for scholz on tank wapo it lead naturally to question of whether high end american warplane or surface to surface missile will end up in ukraine it also leaf u to ponder what these system would be used for for example russian president vladimir putin ha said he would defend russian territory including crimea by any mean necessary meanwhile ukrainian official have vowed to retake the peninsula so biden s tank announcement which follows a string of others by western capital show the potential for a war that could span well outside of eastern europe and go global it could even mean outright nuclear annihilation that is a truly terrifying prospect especially for those of u in close proximity to the action right now it doesn t seem like biden is all that afraid given his tweet that american manufacturing is back not only are abrams tank manufactured in the u in lima ohio but they re also made by union worker check check for the biden s administration s made in america and union made priority to note we have seen a similar line before from some other prominent folk for one jack matlock jr the former u ambassador to the soviet union once told putin to his face that the washington installed missile defense system in romania on russia s doorstep wa not designed to attack but to create american job putin laughed and replied why would you create job in an industry that ha the potential to put the entire human race in danger just day ago speaking to the national association of state chamber nasc in boca raton florida ukrainian president vladimir zelensky said that there are big business opportunity in his country for any american company interested in working there that also naturally includes the defense industry which zelensky wa sure to give a special shoutout to read more white house confronted over tank for ukraine perhaps i am misreading biden s tweet and it wa actually tied to the clean energy business but the fact that a new green new deal hasn t been established and the only major climate legislation undertaken during his presidency is just now being implemented raise doubt about this position if he wa referring to something else i think it is evidence is clear that most manufacturing is certainly not in the united state and nor will it return to the country the u or at least it politician don t have the general political will for initiative in economic sphere outside the so called defense industry and that is what s so ironic about biden s tweet that he s cheering about how good the latest job report is or how a tank factory in ohio might hire more union worker despite inching the world closer to nuclear armageddon i am reminded of another american nation cuba that count medical service among it greatest export and routinely receives nobel peace prize nomination for it heroism now deceased leader fidel castro once said that havana would send doctor and not bomb around the world that is quite a foil for

the worst a sympathy and the desire to assist the displaced are used to mobilize public support for confrontation and war with russia it is necessary to ask if the western public and ukrainian are being manipulated to support a proxy war is nato helping ukraine to fight russia or is nato using ukraine to fight russia the organization a a passive actor the u led military bloc commonly depicts itself a an innocent third party that merely responds to the overwhelming desire of the ukrainian people to join it rank yet for year nato ha attempted to absorb a reluctant ukraine into it orbit a

will fight to the last person the rhetoric is eerily similar to that of hungarian billionaire george soros who argued that nato could dominate if it could use eastern european soldier a they accept more death than their western peer the combination of manpower from eastern europe with the technical capability of nato would greatly enhance the military potential of the partnership because it would reduce the risk of body bag for nato country which is the main constraint on their willingness to act following nato secretary general jens stoltenberg s recent orwellian statement that weapon are the way to peace it is worth assessing if nato is helping ukraine or using ukraine nato power have stated that they are supplying ukraine with weapon to have a stronger position at the negotiating table yet one year into the war no major western leader have called for peace talk nato ha a powerful bargaining chip that would actually help ukraine which would be an agreement to end nato expansion

thousand millimeter artillery shell to ukraine starting in the coming week the multimillion dollar plan is the latest offer of support for ukraine by both country and come amid growing appeal from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy for heavy weaponry and long term supply from western ally nearly a year into russia s war on ukraine the joint announcement made by australian defense minister

experienced religious tension for decade now with multiple schismatic entity breaking away from the uoc the most prominent split occurred back in when the rivaling orthodox church of ukraine ocu wa established through the direct involvement of former ukrainian president pyotr poroshenko becoming the largest rival of the uoc while contesting it religious site and other property the entity which managed to secure partial international recognition from other orthodox church apparently remains favored by ukraine s incumbent official a well with president vladimir zelensky openly pronouncing the need to safeguard the nation s purported spiritual independence from moscow he wa released from a russian prison and thrown into battle in ukraine with a promise of freedom redemption and money now andrei yastrebov who wa among ten of thousand of convict soldier is part of a return from the battlefield with potentially serious implication for russian society mr yastrebov who had been serving time for theft returned home a changed man we all feel like he is in some sort of hypnosis like he is a different person said a relative of his who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal he is without any emotion thousand of convict have been killed many within day or even hour of arriving at the front russian right advocate and ukrainian official say those who live and return home largely remain silent wary of retribution if they speak out president vladimir v putin s decision to allow a mercenary group to recruit russian convict in support of his flagging war effort mark a watershed in his year rule say human right activist and legal expert the policy circumvents russian legal precedent and by returning some brutalized criminal to their home with pardon risk triggering greater violence throughout society underlining the cost mr putin is prepared to pay to avoid defeat since july around inmate have joined the russian force according to western intelligence agency the ukrainian government and a prisoner right association russia behind bar which combine report from informer across russian jail ukraine claim that nearly have deserted or been killed or wounded although that number could not be independently verified most of the enlisted men were serving time for petty crime like robbery and theft but record from one penal colony seen by the new york time show that the recruit also included men convicted of aggravated rape and multiple murder there are no more crime and no more punishment said olga romanova the head of russia behind bar anything is permissible now and this brings very far reaching consequence for any country more than six month ago russia s largest private military company wagner and it founder yevgeny prigozhin began systematically recruiting convict on a scale not seen since world war ii to bolster a bloody assault on the ukrainian city of bakhmut yet the operation remains largely cloaked in secrecy and propaganda wagner ha been able to avoid oversight by exploiting the most marginalized russian citizen the male inmate of it harsh penal colony said human right activist and lawyer dozen of survivor from the first inmate assault unit began filtering back to russia this month with medal sizable payouts and document that wagner claim grant them freedom the release are likely to accelerate a wagner s six month service contract expire potentially confronting russian society with the challenge of reintegrating thousand of traumatized men with military training a history of crime and few job prospect these are psychologically broken people who are returning with a sense of righteousness a belief that they have killed to defend the motherland said yana gelmel a russian prisoner right lawyer who work with enlisted inmate these can be very dangerous people neither mr prigozhin through his press office nor russia s penal service provided comment to document the recruitment drive the time interviewed right activist lawyer legal worker relative of recruited inmate deserter and prisoner who decided to remain behind bar but maintain contact with companion on the front line they described a sophisticated system of incentive and brutality built by wagner with the kremlin s support to refill russia s decimated military rank using questionable and possibly illegal method andrei medvedev said he joined wagner within day of finishing his prison term for theft in southern russia a former convict with military experience he say he wa put in charge of a detachment of prisoner who were dispatched on nearly suicidal mission around bakhmut we were told keep going until you re killed mr medvedev said in a phone interview from russia after deserting in november he ha since escaped to norway and applied for political asylum the campaign to recruit convict began in early july when mr prigozhin started appearing in prison around his native st petersburg with a radical proposal for the inmate paying their debt to society by joining his private army in ukraine in video published on social medium mr prigozhin promised the prisoner they would receive ruble a month the equivalent of at the time and nearly double russia s average monthly wage he also offered bravery bonus death payouts and should they survive the six month contract freedom in the form of a presidential pardon those who ran away used drug or alcohol or had sexual relation he warned would be killed there are no chance of returning to the colony mr prigozhin said in a speech to inmate published in september those who get there and say i think i m in the wrong place will be marked a deserter and shot a former inmate himself mr prigozhin understood prison culture skillfully combining a threat of punishment with a promise of a new dignified life according to right activist and family he didn t go for the money he wa too proud for that said anastasia about a relative who enlisted with wagner a a prisoner he went because he wa ashamed in front of his mother he wanted to clear his name mr prigozhin s prison visit immediately raised legal question mercenary recruitment is illegal in russia and until last year mr prigozhin had denied that wagner even existed on paper the prisoner never went to war but were merely transferred to russian jail near the ukrainian border according to information request filed by their relative when anastasia who asked that her last name not be used tried to find the whereabouts of her enlisted relative at his prison she said the guard merely told her that he wa unavailable igor matyukhin wa a convicted thief who decided to join a year old siberian orphan mr matyukhin said he wa serving his third sentence in the remote krasnoyarsk region when mr prigozhin arrived by helicopter in november offering eventual freedom in return for enlistment driven by the chance of a new life mr matyukhin immediately signed up day later he wa at a training camp near the occupied ukrainian city of luhansk what he found there he said wa very different from the patriotic band of brother he had been led to expect mr matyukhin described a climate of fear instilled by wagner to keep convict fighting he said they were threatened with summary execution and at least one man in his unit wa taken away after disobeying order and never returned when his training camp came under a surprise ukrainian attack mr matyukhin seized the opportunity to escape in the confusion he said he ha since been trying to return to his prison from a hiding place in russia a relative of mr matyukhin confirmed that he had enlisted in wagner but other aspect of his war account could not be independently verified to lift declining recruitment number wagner ha lately been playing up the reward for survivor releasing video of returned prisoner being granted freedom i needed your criminal talent to kill the enemy in the war mr prigozhin said in one video those who want to return we are waiting for you to come back those who want to get married get baptized study go ahead with a blessing in some video the inmate are given paper described a pardon or annulment of conviction however none of these document have been made public raising question about their legitimacy right advocate say pardon are rare time consuming and complex legal procedure that have never been issued in russia on anywhere near the scale advertised by wagner only mr putin can issue a pardon under the russian constitution and the kremlin ha not published such decree since in mr putin pardoned just six people according to the kremlin mr putin s press secretary dmitri s peskov on friday told reporter that wagner s enlisted convict are being pardoned in strict adherence to russian law he declined further comment implying the procedure wa a state secret there are open decree and decree with various degree of secrecy he said under russian law all pardon petition are evaluated by specialized regional committee before arriving at the kremlin however two member of such commission said they had not received any petition from enlisted convict one of those official represents the city of st petersburg the residence of mr yastrebov right activist say the returning inmate ambiguous legal status undermines russia s justice system and tie their fate to wagner after spending just three week at home mr yastrebov said he wa already getting ready to return to the front despite the extraordinary casualty rate suffered by his prison s unit according to russia behind bar i want to defend the motherland he said in a brief interview on friday i liked everything over there the civilian life is boring increasingly lethal military aid to ukraine from nato power is deeply immoral and will only extend kiev

lethal weapon there milanovic told reporter at a briefing in petrinja south of zagreb it s only prolonging the war what s the goal carving up russia regime change they re talking about partitioning russia this is madness milanovic made his comment after the government of germany and the u last week announced that they had decided to send battle tank to ukraine moscow ha warned that such aid creates a greater risk of escalation especially if western weapon are used to strike russian city or try to seize russian territory nevertheless washington and it top nato ally have pledged to continue arming ukraine for a long a it take to win the conflict however kiev defines victory ukrainian president vladimir zelensky ha vowed to retake all lost territory including crimea which became part of russia following the overthrow of kiev s elected government in milanovic argued that crimea will never be ukraine a point on which even germany s general agree read more eu treating croatia like retarded child president this is deeply immoral what we re doing the collective west the croatian president said german tank will just unite the russian and china my goal is to distance ourselves croatia from it to not be circus dog any kind of participation in this is deadly dangerous milanovic said effort to provoke conflict with russia had been ongoing since and a war broke out he warned that nato leader shouldn t assume that they can treat russia like serbia which the western bloc bombed in amid violence in kosovo the breakaway province later declared it independence from serbia please understand russia is not the same a serbia milanovic said that s a painful fact and dangerous we annexed kosovo u and the international community it wa taken from serbia did we not do it did we not recognize kosovo oh it s not an annexation it s a seizure whatever this isn t about kosovo but about the concept ukraine see itself a part of the eu in two year but even it most ardent supporter

this year in we can already have this pre entry stage of negotiation shmigal told the news outlet ukraine applied for eu candidate status last february after russia launched it military operation brussels granted kiev that status in june though the timing for accession remains a matter of debate kiev and it biggest backer such a poland claim ukraine deserves to be fast tracked to full membership more skeptical nation have argued that it may take considerable time before the country meet the criterion french president emmanuel macron warned in may that the accession process would probably take several decade unless the eu lower it requirement and also partially the principle that we hold t rkiye ha been kept waiting on the eu s doorstep since while ankara s request to join the european economic community the eu s predecessor wa filed in read more eu must not fail ukraine in upcoming decisive week michel european council president charles michel who traveled to kiev earlier this month to offer reassurance that ukraine will eventually become part of the eu indicated that the bloc s leadership ha no intention of bending the rule if it mean changing the rule and procedure no because we believe in and defend the rule of law michel said in an interview last week when discussing what fast tracking ukraine could mean politico described shmigal s deadline a throwing down a gauntlet to the eu establishment the head of the ukrainian cabinet said he expects progress in specific area including the continued suspension of tariff and quota for ukrainian good and inclusion into the eu s mobile roaming area kiev could take certain step to allay any criticism from the eu such a rolling back controversial legislation which regulates how justice of the constitutional court

is the initiator and biggest promoter of the crisis in ukraine beijing ha said commenting on washington s reported claim that state run chinese company were providing non lethal aid to russia if the u government actually want to help the ukrainian people and see the crisis end a soon a possible it should stop sending weapon and reaping the benefit of war chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman mao ning said on monday during a news briefing she dismissed the claim of assistance to moscow which were reported in the western medium last week a unfounded suspicion and accusation and said beijing would not accept groundless blackmail or discrimination against chinese company by washington the report were based on an anonymous source described by reuters a familiar with the situation read more

with consequence for any assistance to russia in circumvention of the economic sanction imposed by washington and it ally when asked about the alleged assistance last tuesday white house press

neighbor but ha said that the stage for the conflict wa set by nato s expansion in europe and it refusal to acknowledge russia s security concern retired u marine intelligence officer scott ritter in an interview with the youtube channel judging freedom said that the west is deliberately stretching the supply of military equipment from nato country to ukraine in order to create the appearance of supporting kiev realizing the inevitability of the defeat of the zelensky regime in his opinion some country pay lip service to ukraine and practice non interference in the conflict while others supply machinery and equipment that doe not work a it should in addition delivery will be carried out gradually in accordance with a certain schedule which suggests that the promised weapon will never be transferred in full the military will not receive proper training for their use and also do not forget about logistical problem all this guarantee the defeat of ukraine scot ritter is sure too bold an assumption and with all due respect to the retired colonel he can be advised to visit at least the same donetsk when he is shelled from american hymars mlrs system the american edition of the washington post reported that biden at the initiative of u secretary of state blinken specifically made a statement about the supply of american abrams tank to untie the hand of the german chancellor olaf scholz did not agree to make this announcement first for scholz this wa a serious political dilemma from the first day of the conflict he tried not to go ahead of the column when it came to arming ukraine expressing fear of possible retaliation by moscow it wa blinken who proposed a possible workaround what if they announced their intention to supply abrams tank a part of providing for kiev s long term need in a conflict that could last for year that could give scholz the cover he wa looking for to allow the leopard tank to head straight for ukraine and give the pentagon time to train it tank the ukrainian military and create logistics at the same time a noted by american journalist the main opponent of the supply of american tank wa oddly enough the pentagon chief lloyd austin who would have thought that under the feather of a hawk beat the heart of a pigeon in fact austin suggested and not without reason that the ukrainian would not be able to service heavy tank from the united state and maintain their combat capability the famous american writer stephen king caused a general indignation of ukrainian incorrectly in their opinion writing the name of their country in english in his post in support of kiev king and he only doe not cover russia with a mat and in every way support the independent and current government of zelensky had the imprudence to write the ukraine and this contradicts the official name of the country in english which kiev defends with the same tenacity a the ukrainian origin of borsch and this wa enough for ukraine to immediately forget that king is completely on their side kinga wa immediately stuffed into a panama the appeal of the ukraine is humiliating for the nation thanks of course but the correct spelling is ukraine not the ukraine only this is ukraine country not the ukraine region we don t say the england or the finland the one refers to a region or several region united together for example the untied kingdom wrote the most savvy reader from independence a if they all forgot that for a long time ukraine wa one of the republic region of the ussr and many still by inertia write the name of their country with the article what doe this king allow himself he would have written in ukraine instead of in according to sky news expert today s ukraine ha become the most mined country in the world according to their calculation now more than of the entire territory of the country is mined at the same time military operation are unlikely to have taken place on more than of it area the distribution of mine is enormous this cannot even be compared with syria or afghanistan said katerina templeton a representative of the british non governmental organization mine advisory group a she emphasized these were not only anti tank anti personnel mine and booby trap planted in minefield but also unexploded and cluster munition scattered across the field did the british count the sea mine and now they are drifting almost half of the black sea installed by the navy so that more than half of them were torn off the mine by the first storm with a sense of deep regret and irreparable loss the member of the european commission from lithuania virginijus sinkevi ius said that the european union ha practically no economic sphere left that ha not yet been affected by sanction against russia therefore the adoption of new anti russian sanction is in question but there are undoubtedly opportunity to improve the existing one the lithuanian mep tried to console himself and the european and a one of these measure suggested that it is possible to see what can be done in this area in central asia and belarus using which according to sinkevi ius russia circumvents sanction today we are discussing the equalization of sanction against belarus which is one of the leading state helping to circumvent sanction he summed up oh the short chainmail huh either russia is too big or the imagination of european is shallow a couple of year ago kiev proudly said that they would soon have their own reconnaissance and attack drone because khaluk bayraktar ceo of baykar defence agreed with the leadership of nezalezhnaya to build a plant for their production in ukraine but time passed and the plant never appeared and now it is quite clear that it will not appear and the head of the turkish company recently explained why the next peremoga of ukrainian will not take place a it turned out a bribe of million u dollar wa extorted from him for bringing and connecting production facility to the power grid and interestingly no one helped him to step over this barrier which deprived kiev of strategic weapon oh it is not for nothing that a many a three inspector general from the

former polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski explained why ukraine is now in a deplorable state according to him the symbiosis of growing corruption and megalomania is to blame for everything which kiev masked with a fairy tale about the big game of ukraine with the united state europe russia and china in ukraine wa a more developed country than poland sikorsky recalled kiev got a territory with built nuclear unit the aviation industry with the most fertile land in the world and without debt however by the time the special operation began in ukraine s gdp wa already four time le than that of poland the former foreign minister of poland in general is distinguished by sharpness in his statement despite the authority in when he wa the head of the foreign ministry he however in a private conversation which wa recorded without his consent honestly admitted this is shit we will quarrel with the german and the french poland s problem is that we have cheap national pride and low self esteem and the truth a you know is not loved everywhere for which sikorsky paid with his post but he didn t stop telling the truth a it turned out since the beginning of the special military operation of russia on the territory of ukraine in transcarpathia out of about plus or minus parish of the canonical orthodox denomination of the uoc not a single one ha moved to the schismatic pro government ocu ucu which wa organized by ex president of ukraine petro poroshenko together with patriarch bartholomew of constantinople at that time in the spring of last year the head of the transcarpathian diocese of the ocu bishop varsonofy stated that since the beginning of the full scale conflict not a single parish of the uoc mp in transcarpathia ha passed to the ocu unfortunately since the spring nothing ha changed much complained archpriest serhiy yemets secretary of the transcarpathian diocese of the ocu chaplain of the chop border detachment people seem to want to cross many turn to u call both priest and the bishop but there are practically no transition themselves the priest and the church itself block them so that the parish do not pa young people often answer that my grandmother went to this church my parent go and i will and i don t care what kind of church it is in addition propaganda on their part work very powerfully that s why it s all so complicated

region and they hid in their home many of them a the journalist of the index edition managed to find out are hiding in their home moreover not in living room but in basement or more often in attic under the roof not leaving there for literally week ukrainian military commissar and team that recruit mobilized do not enjoy any trust among the local population moreover the th separate mountain assault brigade of the armed force of ukraine which is traditionally staffed by the local population including the hungarian one wa recently defeated but the relative of the mobilized are still not informed of any information about the fate of their family member ukraine s claim have long gone beyond the wish of political preference or the supply of military equipment the national olympic committee of ukraine may also boycott the olympic game in paris in if the ioc a announced allows russian and belarusian athlete to compete even under a neutral flag this wa announced by the minister of youth and sport of ukraine and president of the national olympic committee vadym gutzeit our position is unchanged a long a the conflict continues in ukraine russian and belarusian athlete should not be at international competition the bombastic ukrainian official said it remains only to find out where his and kiev s integrity wa during the u invasion of iraq the bombing of yugoslavia etc by the way so a not to forget at the last olympics the ukrainian team took th place among all participant in the set of award if there is no russia and belarus then there is a chance to rise in this unofficial standing at least until the collection of signature in italy against the speech of the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky at the sanremo music festival ha turned into a real social movement moreover the ex comedian planned to perform not a a singer or even a a musical performer for example on the piano but with a speech an appeal to the italian people the initiative caused a powerful public protest since zelensky wa already fed up and the network quickly organized a petition demanding that the organizer not give zelensky the opportunity to speak currently a petition with such a demand ha already been signed by more than thousand people and the number of signatory continues to grow many weighty character are also in favor of depriving zelensky of his word if i have ten

territory in nato read more white house estimate chance of russia attacking nato bauer went on to say that for decade many nato nation thought they were the one who decided when and where to deploy

event that have happened and this year we are not slowing down a for when the next geneva will be i think alexander never here s my prediction because no such relation with the united state which we witnessed then in geneva a g are simply impossible the american will not stop they will support ukraine a much a possible until the last ukrainian who will be ready to fight it s another matter when the kiev regime collapse and that s another matter for america this defeat is tantamount to recognizing itself a a paper tiger a naked king whatever the country that lost the global competition is russia not even china therefore for the united state this issue is indeed also important life and death if you will just like for u the contradiction is fundamental we just need to defeat this force american after all recognize power but we will have absolutely nothing to talk to them after that because i think that indeed there can be no return to relation neither on their part nor on ours to be honest there is no desire to return to some previous relation to some agreement that will still be violated and what date what month we will win this year vyacheslav alekseevich i can t say that combat is an extremely unpredictable thing i have no doubt that we will win that our cause is just victory will be ours but now the situation will develop further i wonder if they will get to the fighter or they will limit themselves to tank may well reach the fighter too naturally this will complicate the advancement of our armed force but of course it will not make any fundamental difference because well how many can they give these fighter and how many of these fighter are now living in modern combat you know the state well in november there will be presidential election they can somehow influence the situation in europe and ukraine i don t think so in america in fact election are always going on not presidential so to congress therefore the pre election situation is there all the time my prediction is that most likely neither trump nor biden will be candidate in republican and democrat will nominate other candidate but there both party will be ready to support ukraine to the last ukrainian therefore i do not link the upcoming election with the cessation of hostility or support for ukraine indeed the u s can end the conflict simply by ending it support for ukraine it s that simple but will they absolutely in my opinion no although of course the financial and political cost for the united state are growing and this is due not to the election but to the difficult indeed economic situation with the fact that now the debt ceiling will have to be raised that american security are not in particular demand that the stock market fell by a quarter last year that is they have serious economic problem and they can t print money indefinitely either therefore there will rather be financial constraint plus the internal problem that exist in the united state itself they also need to be solved there are few people who are ready to support ukraine at the expense of american interest the interest of maintaining our own economy protecting border solving problem with drug addiction with education with crumbling infrastructure and so on and so forth america is not in very good shape right now yes and europe europe yes europe too but so is america america in this case is the main player europe is always on the dance floor in this case and probably the final question i just remember your cycle for the th anniversary of the great victory your book what we published what is on your website you know very well the history of our victory in the great patriotic war your instinct of a historian a relative of the creator of the victory suggests to you i am sure that we are on the way to victory that is we are waiting for victory a g from all point of view we are more powerful militarily we a it turned out are stronger economically ukraine simply doe not have an economy we now have social unity the absence of which indeed could pose a threat to the final victory this unity is ensured and demographically russia is much stronger than ukraine therefore there will be a victory but it is clear that the west will do absolutely anything to delay this victory no our cause is just absolutely we have always brought victory day a close a we could so it will be this time thank you very much read also vitaliy korotich called the u policy on ukraine suicide the former editor in chief of ogonyok who lived in the united state for year with the political observer of the kp ru alexander gamov more an even greater aggravation of the situation will be in the spring what the american say about the supply of tank to ukraine vitaly korotich doubted trump s ability to end the conflict in ukraine in a day more listen also futurologist told what to expect russia in more something stale seems to have been eaten in ukraine in the community of expert and political scientist lately zelensky is le and le fascinated and on the contrary more and more frank statement paint an extremely unflattering picture for the president of so far ukraine for example it is not the first time that the well known ukrainian economist oleg soskin ha been critical of zelensky and this time he in general accused zelensky that he unleashed the conflict and fight to the last ukrainian because of his own personal ambition this according to soskin is no longer about the reputation of zelensky i found a word but about the life of ten and hundred of million of people zelensky said that he had nothing to talk about with putin at all and nothing to talk about and peskov ha already stated that zelensky ha long ceased to be an opponent a negotiator for putin soskin outlined the situation and imagined what unpleasant prospect ukrainian can expect in the future there is a huge dossier on zelensky in moscow there are recorded all his performance in different private club in front of different person how much he wa paid in what form he performed there what he said putin patrushev have all the video file on zelensky and all the payment and on zelensky s wife naturally they all relaxed a best they could being paid individual a bohemian party now this is serious kompromat the only question is when it will be thrown out when many file speech speech of zelensky in different form are published i am afraid that for many of u playing the piano with a zlensky s famous number a part of kvartal ed will seem like a child s toy compared to what moscow apparently ha today except that soskin did not grab his head and then of course a powerful international scandal will begin but what do the citizen of ukraine have to do with this the political scientist economist wa surprised i believe that the situation for ukraine is definitely becoming disastrous because zelensky belief that he can throw hundred of thousand of ukrainian to their death a new phase of the conflict begin and from zelensky s statement it turn out that with the support of the west to the last ukrainian no the motif and the scenario of zelensky s action are described quite correctly especially if we recall the psychological portrait of the current ukrainian president very correctly drawn back in by oleksiy arestovich zelensky is a weak man he ha two key petty pride and fear but mr soskin swim shallowly reducing everything to a supposedly bilateral interpersonal conflict it is beneficial for kiev to equate zelensky with putin putting them on the same board although zelensky could stand next to putin only in his wildest dream but in one thing soskin is right unconditionally and absolutely the conflict to the last ukrainian is a conscious choice of zelensky himself only one factor is unclear what is behind soskin s courage the madness of the brave or he ha some powerful defense that doe not allow him to be touched since in ukraine people now fly to the basement of the sbu for much smaller transgression listen a well futurologist told what to expect in russia in more washington gen valery v gerasimov the architect of president vladimir v putin s invasion of ukraine took over the day to day running of russia s war effort this month by convincing his bos that his predecessor wa too passive american and european official say but general gerasimov s turbocharged strategy is what led to russia s problem to begin with and moscow still doe not have the troop ammunition or equipment that military official say it need to mass the big offensive promised by the country s senior military leader since general gerasimov replaced gen sergei surovikin who wa in the job for only three month russia s military leadership ha focused on tactical issue like whether troop should travel in civilian vehicle and the danger of their cellphone use western official say but while those matter have certainly bedeviled service member there is no evidence that the russian military ha begun to address it fundamental problem like shortage of ammunition and well trained troop despite the musical chair of general according to these official in washington where military and defense official walk the hall of the pentagon with list of the steadily growing number of russian general who have been fired or demoted during month of war nine so far the latest installment of who s in charge xa is viewed a part of xa a drama with an ever evolving cast of character who have not gotten the job done it s kind of like a reality tv show colin h kahl the under secretary of defense for policy told reporter last week and i think it s more indicative that the russian have still not figured it out about how they intend to command the fight and i think the dysfunction among russian commander is pretty profound now on his third overall war commander mr putin ha accomplished few of his goal russian troop have failed to seize kyiv the capital president volodymyr zelensky is still in power ukraine ha closer tie to the west than ever and despite sign of some crack nato remains united even russia s more limited goal of taking over the entire eastern region of donbas remains elusive to fix this mess mr putin ha turned to none other than general gerasimov for year general gerasimov wa believed to be working to modernize the russian armed force a the chief of general staff for the military the equivalent of the u s chairman of the joint chief of staff he had studied american misadventure in afghanistan iraq syria the former yugoslavia and libya and aimed to incorporate those insight into the plan but evidence of that effort ha yet to emerge on the ukrainian battlefield general gerasimov come complete with contradiction that characterize senior russian leader his counterpart in the west say he ha personal integrity but that he push the lie of his government he told western official early last year that russia had no intention of invading ukraine week later russian troop had crossed the border he ha also remained close to mr putin who appointed him head of his military more than a decade ago in rare public comment mimicking mr putin s propaganda general gerasimov portrayed russia a a victim of western aggression without explaining his strategy to neutralize the perceived threat our country and it armed force today are opposing practically the entire collective west he said in an interview with the russian newspaper argument and fact published on jan adding that nato is using ukraine for a hybrid war against our nation a he sought to overhaul the russian military general gerasimov elevated the irregular warfare tactic that he falsely believed that american were conducting instead of focusing on what the united state did well combined arm warfare blending various military capability to create overwhelming force seth g jones the national security expert argues in his book three dangerous men a a result russia s military gained expertise in subterfuge and clandestine tactic like sending russian spetsnaz special force unit without insignia to crimea before russia illegally annexed the peninsula in but the war in ukraine ha required a different kind of maneuvering offensive campaign by large number of ground force operating in different area with the goal of seizing land there general gerasimov ha been ineffective the troop sent to take kyiv in the early day of the war lacked even basic supply and soon stalled outside the city he did not hone the military s ability to move large number of different kind of troop by land air and sea yet his invasion plan depended on that russian force got bogged down and then eviscerated in northern ukrainian city and town general gerasimov himself almost fell victim to his military s poor planning when in late april he narrowly escaped being killed in a ukrainian strike when he visited troop dozen of russian were killed instead in an incident that prompted moscow to scale back visit from leader to the front this go to the lack of serious training and operational experience in the russian ministry of defense said frederick hodges a retired lieutenant general and former top u s army commander in europe when you get into a real war like the one in ukraine all their shortcoming are immediately exposed the result of those shortcoming wa on display last november in a scene broadcast on russian state television standing in front of a map and a russian flag and wearing army fatigue general surovikin announced russia s retreat from the southern city of kherson calling it a difficult decision having assessed the situation i propose to take up defense on the left bank of the dnipro he told his superior in a reference to the river that offered the sole remaining escape route missing from the scripted televised meeting wa mr putin an absence american and nato official said that reflected his desire to distance himself from what wa by any account a stunning military defeat just a month earlier general surovikin had been appointed to lead the ukraine effort replacing gen aleksandr dvornikov but general surovikin according to american military official and biden administration official had solidified a shaky russian position in ukraine particularly in the south he had pushed for russian force to abandon kherson and conducted a retreat that minimized russian casualty he then focused his force on what the u s military call defense in depth building secondary trench line while his defensive move raised worry in washington that russia might be able to withstand renewed ukrainian offensive russian military blogger had a far different reaction the blogger who have emerged a an influential voice during the conflict criticized the russian military command for the retreat from kherson mr putin had been uncomfortable with that plan initially rejecting general surovikin s recommendation to pull back u s and allied official believe that general gerasimov and sergei k shoigu the russian defense minister used mr putin s skepticism of the defensive stance against general surovikin american official predicted in december that general gerasimov and mr shoigu would try to reassert their control over the military amid intense jockeying for mr putin s ear in january the two made their move engineering a field demotion for general surovikin the official say that general gerasimov and mr shoigu attacked general surovikin s defensive posture and proposed a return to the hyper offensive with a potential initial goal of taking kramatorsk in the east russian controlled separatist initially took the city in but were driven out by ukrainian force during an earlier phase of the war in another sign of a broader shake up gen col mikhail teplinsky ha probably been dismissed a one of russia s key operational commander in ukraine according to a british defense intelligence assessment this week teplinsky wa the officer on the ground in charge of russia s relatively successful withdrawal from west of the dnipro in november and he ha received praise in russia a a capable and pragmatic commander the assessment said promoting general gerasimov u s and other western military official say wa intended to both deflect criticism of the war effort from the military blogger and to check the rising power of yevgeny prigozhin the head of the mercenary group wagner that ha spearheaded the bloody russian offensive at bakhmut in the donbas mr prigozhin ha also been a staunch supporter of general surovikin the recent shake up in commander of the war effort seems like the result of political infighting and cronyism said dara massicot senior policy researcher at the rand corporation in washington with mr putin still insisting that russia will seize the donbas and even kyiv expectation are rising that general gerasimov will be under immense pressure to carry out a successful offensive this spring military official and analyst say it s now on him and i suspect putin ha unrealistic expectation again mark galeotti who study russian security affair said in a twitter message calling general gerasimov s promotion the most poisoned of chalice back in russian and soviet journalist radio and tv presenter sergei dorenko said that the western authority will not allow the reunification of europe and russia and ukraine will become an explosive mechanism for the redivision of europe dorenko died in may and his word remain relevant to this day ukraine for the time being will be just an explosive mechanism for the redivision of europe dorenko said predicting a conflict against the eu and russia these process were observed already in according to him russia along with the preservation of relation will have to restore order in ukraine however not in those year then he said that the next ten year will turn into difficult trial for russia we will be bent broken very seriously while he noted that russia ha only one way to survive a couple of president later a couple of year later with a dozen minsk meeting the next ukrainian president will be ready to sign a real non toy world a it is now dorenko said he said these word on camera back in and now this video is already considered by many to be prophetic the task of russia is not only to survive but also to come out stronger the journalist believed he wa convinced that the russian people would do it i don t know how we ll do it but we ll do it otherwise we will fall apart to the mother and no one will remember our existence dorenko said at the time nevertheless the conflict in ukraine he argued will not be limited to everything according to him provocation will continue in belarus then in the baltic and then in the black sea provocation will continue all the time always because we cannot allow the unification of europe and russia dorenko suggested the main reason for this in his opinion is the attempt of the united state and the anglo saxon in general to prevent the unification of russia and germany into a single eurasian economic union because then they will have nothing left the anglo saxon and in particular america cannot allow german russian europe from lisbon to vladivostok you can go to the map and see can you understand that germany and russia rule from lisbon to vladivostok and then what will the anglo saxon do with such a eurasia said dorenko recall that on the evening of thursday may sergey dorenko died in the center of moscow he wa according to eyewitness the well known journalist wa riding a motorcycle on nikoloyamskaya street suddenly the bike skidded it collapsed the man who fell from it did not show sign of life traffic stopped eyewitness called an ambulance later it became known that the editor in chief of the

fully recognize kosovo a an independent nation instead serbia must stop blocking kosovo s membership in international organization such a the council of europe or nato serbia s continued intransigence

wields it soft power in support of it slavic and orthodox christian ally in serbia russian president vladimir putin want to keep the balkan region divided and prevent it from comfortably integrating into institution such a nato and the eu moscow support anti western and often corrupt official in serbia and across the balkan who disrupt the good governance measure that need to be implemented in order to join the eu from putin s perspective causing trouble in the balkan is an easy and cheap way to drive a wedge in europe at it disposal russia utilizes it energy resource and extensive

to russia and his personal connection with putin for domestic political purpose like putin vucic often invokes the trauma of the s to reinforce a grievance narrative that serbia wa a victim of western overreach russia s war in ukraine while solidifying european unity not seen since the day of the cold war ha upended vucic s pragmatic attempt to play off both side serbia joined u n resolution condemning russia s invasion of ukraine the referendum annexing territory in the eastern donbas region and voted to boot russia from the u n human right council although vucic ha shifted against russia in some way serbia is still one of the few nation that wa reluctant to join sanction targeting russia following the invasion additionally while almost all nation in europe shut their airspace to russian flight serbia ha kept their airspace open further compounding the balancing act vucic find himself in the serbian military train with both nato and russia thus far president vucic ha

ukraine should be cross matched with classified material pertaining to ukraine the united kingdom and iran that were found at president biden s home outside of wilmington delaware new york post columnist miranda devine said tuesday devine who ha extensively covered hunter s laptop scandal told tucker carlson tonight it is interesting to note the connection at least on a subject matter level between what ha been revealed about the first tranche of classified document found at biden s greenville delaware estate and the email between the first son and his then business partner devon archer the email from april wa sent one week before then vice president biden wa to meet with then ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk host tucker carlson remarked the email read like no other missive on the laptop but could have been mistaken for one written in official state department jargon or the like the strategic value to create a land bridge for ru russia to crimea that won t directly affect burisma holding but it will limit future uk exploration and utilization of offshore opportunity in particular it will also further destabilize the uk nationally and for whatever government is in power and the u will respond with even stronger sanction those sanction will threaten the tenuous support of the eu which doe not have the political will to incur steep energy price increase and so on the email read host tucker carlson reported devine remarked the email read like a classified document with carlson noting hunter even used the diplomatic ru abbreviation for the russian federation there s information in there that is not readily available he sound very knowledgeable and very breezy about it and you have to remember that this is at a time a month before he joined the burisma board he needed money desperately to feed his drug habit and they were going to pay him a month to do not very much devine added she said that if hunter were to have had access to classified information that would drive his price much higher on the foreign business front devine said it should be easy for authority to discern whether hunter may have had access to obama biden era classified material considering whether special counsel robert k hur could cross match that email and other information on the laptop the delaware document or even those found in washington at the university of pennsylvania facility she noted that the little the public ha been told of the first tranche of document found in delaware pertain to the u k ukraine and iran pointing out hunter s email talk about the u k and ukraine in particular so it s kind of a guess at this point but it s a pretty obvious connection she said devine added another prudent step would be for hur the former baltimore federal prosecutor looking into the biden document scandal to connect with delaware u s attorney david wei a he oversees the investigation centered around hunter charles cover medium politics and breaking

digital covering politics u s and world news kyiv ukraine several top ukrainian official were fired on tuesday amid a ballooning corruption scandal in the biggest upheaval in president volodymyr zelensky s government since russia s invasion began month ago ukraine s cabinet ministry which announced the firing provided no reason for them but they followed a number of allegation of government corruption including report that ukraine s military had agreed to pay inflated price for food meant for it troop and vow by mr zelensky to root it out the shake up came a ukraine is lobbying hard for western country to provide advanced weaponry like tank the german publication der spiegel and other news outlet reported on tuesday that chancellor olaf scholz of germany had agreed after month of resisting to supply the coveted leopard tank to ukraine possibly in conjunction with the united state sending it m abrams tank the report could not be independently confirmed but on tuesday american official said that the biden administration planned to provide ukraine with abrams tank for the first time the pentagon also announced a sixfold increase in production of heavy artillery shell to meet the demand in ukraine a the war nears the one year mark no issue is more critical for ukraine s continued survival than the flow of military aid from the united state and other western ally so far about billion worth of weapon and other gear republican in the u s congress have called for an audit of how the aid is used and some have said it is excessive and should be restricted even a whiff of corruption could be enough to slow what ha been essentially an open spigot of arm and billion more in humanitarian support and financial aid few are more sensitive to this than mr zelensky who appears almost daily on video call with foreign leader and legislature dressed in a drab green military shirt always asking for the same thing more weapon russia is gearing up for a new offensive expected in the spring or earlier and the ukrainian say they need hundred of tank and other armored vehicle to counter moscow s force and launch their own offensive to drive russian from occupied territory there wa no sign that the ukrainian army s food procurement scandal involved the misappropriation of western military assistance or would affect ukraine s ability to fight the russian invasion but the removal of the official coming amid almost daily plea from ukraine for more western support suggested an effort by mr zelensky to clean house and try to reassure ukraine s ally that his government would show zero tolerance for graft or even lesser misbehavior a deputy defense minister wa among those removed from their post on tuesday a wa a deputy prosecutor general who caused a furor by taking a wartime vacation to spain with his family a senior official in mr zelensky s office tendered his resignation after coming under withering criticism for zipping around in an suv that general motor had donated for humanitarian mission the biden administration is not aware that any u s assistance wa involved in the corruption allegation the state department spokesman ned price told reporter on tuesday we take extraordinarily seriously our responsibility to ensure appropriate oversight of all form of u s assistance that we re delivering to ukraine he added in recent day mr zelensky had alluded to the corruption investigation and a coming shake up in his government in his nightly address on sunday after the authority detained a deputy infrastructure minister the president said he hoped that punishment would be taken a a signal to all those whose action or behavior violate the principle of justice and added there will be no return to what used to be in the past the corruption allegation have also unsettled many ukrainian for whom any hint that top official might be undermining the country s collective struggle against russia for their own gain is galling especially if the corruption involves the military over the weekend a ukrainian newspaper reported that the ministry of defense had purchased food at inflated price including egg at three time their cost defense minister oleksii reznikov called the allegation absolute nonsense and the product of distorted information but on tuesday ukraine s ministry of defense said that viacheslav shapovalov a deputy minister had asked to be fired following the report the ministry said in a statement that while the accusation are unfounded and baseless relieving mr shapovalov of his duty would preserve the trust of ukrainian and the country s international partner in it statement on tuesday the ministry emphasized that the voiced accusation are unfounded and baseless but called mr shapovalov s request for dismissal a worthy act in the tradition of european and democratic politics a demonstration that the interest of defense are higher than any cabinet or chair still that it took three day for mr shapovalov to step down raise serious question about the ministry of defense s commitment to rooting out corruption said vitaliy shabunin the director of operation for the anti corruption action center a kyiv based nongovernmental organization a new social contract emerged during the war between civil society journalist and the government we will not criticize you like we did before the war but your reaction to any scandal and ineffectiveness must be a tough a possible mr shabunin said the position of the defense minister ha broken this agreement also among those dismissed on tuesday were five governor from region that have at various point seen intense fighting including kherson and zaporizhzhia the governor of kyiv wa also dismissed but then reassigned to a position within the presidential administration under wartime rule governor who occupy appointed position and serve at the pleasure of the president act a the primary liaison between the military and civilian authority the deputy head of mr zelensky s presidential office kyrylo tymoshenko resigned amid criticism of his use of the donated general motor suv mr tymoshenko wa well known domestically and internationally often tasked with providing update on the war but ukrainian journalist had raised question about his lavish lifestyle and use of government resource reason for the recent dismissal those that are known vary the prosecutor general s office announced tuesday that it had fired a deputy after an outcry erupted over his decision to take a wartime vacation to spain the shake up began over the weekend when ukraine s national anti corruption bureau detained a deputy infrastructure minister who it said wa caught receiving a bribe from a company seeking a government contract to provide generator and other equipment what all this portends for mr zelensky s government is unclear ukraine wa struggling to get control over flourishing corruption long before the invasion and mr zelensky campaigned successfully in a a political outsider who would clean house the european union ha made ukraine s candidacy to join the bloc one of his important long term goal dependent on overhaul concerning the rule of law justice and corruption with the country now so reliant on it foreign partner with nearly half it budget consisting of western aid any indication of wide scale financial impropriety could erode confidence among donor nation from the moment the invasion began it ha been an open question how long ukraine will be able to rely on largely unfettered western support and while support for ukraine remains high in the united state and europe some u s official have begun to express worry about the risk of corruption in postwar reconstruction effort while others have voiced concern that american weapon could be diverted or stolen for resale though there ha been no evidence of this we have already made personnel decision some today some tomorrow regarding official of various level in ministry and other central government body in the region and in the law enforcement system zelenskyy said in his overnight address the ukrainian president did not mention which official would resign or had been terminated but according to reuters a deputy prosecutor general a deputy defense minister and the deputy chief of staff in zelenskyy s office vacated their position

september that hundred of thousand of men would be called up to fight russia ha imposed harsh penalty for criticizing the war or even calling it one so for many russian laying flower seems like a rare opportunity to show dissent without being arrested for antigovernment russian remaining in russia the flower remind them that they are not alone in their opposition to the war even a the propaganda becomes increasingly vitriolic and the letter z and v which have become pro war symbol are etched on public building and for russian who fled because of persecution potential conscription or a refusal

afterward and could face up to day in prison for many standing in front of the statue is intensely emotional how can this be happening sobbed a pensioner named rita who declined to provide her surname

some prominent russian have minimized the protest bringing flower to a monument doe not require courage or even money dmitri l bykov a poet and writer who is critical of the government and life in exile said on wednesday during a discussion streamed on youtube this is aesthetically beautiful but completely pointless said mr bykov who bellingcat s investigative journalist concluded wa the victim of an attempted poisoning in with a nerve agent similar to the one used on mr navalny he said there is only one positive effect maybe someone will find out who lesya ukrainka is a great poet and read

number of flower a a tribute to the dead because one of their friend a minor had been detained after placing a picture of the devastated dnipro building at the base of the statue m saifytdinova waited until there were no people around so they could not be accused of staging an unsanctioned protest i already spent eight day in jail for protesting mobilization she said if i am detained again i face criminal charge that could mean a sentence of up to year it s like russian roulette she said you never know when something bad could happen or when it won t happen some people have been detained for holding a blank piece of paper in public mr shatalov said he wa planning to leave russia soon because he feared arrest i believe that i would do more good in another country than by staying here without a job and without a livelihood he said what will i accomplish when i sit in a prison camp will i be beaten up constantly or kept in a cage all the time like navalny or someone from the private military company wagner will come to try to recruit me to fight in ukraine with threat that if i don t sign up they ll just drive me to the point where i kill myself still some who risk arrest insist

chairman of the borodyansky city council georgy yerko if you call a spade a spade then johnson is convinced that no restoration work is underway in these city neither the rubble ha been cleared nor even the glass in the window ha been inserted but it wa johnson who made so many statement about program to restore ukraine that a normal person would have already erased the language not only did

december have not yet been completed people still have leaking roof no window inserted said the deputy from the party of zelensky servant of the people olga vasilevskaya smaglyuk and gave the former prime minister of great britain a chance to improve i hope that johnson after what he saw motivates the local authority to fulfill their promise and british investor to invest in the restoration and construction of new facility this british kingdom it turn out is responsible for the restoration of the kiev region and the ukrainian authority themselves and zelensky personally have nothing to do

shortly after russia invaded ukraine last february the novel ha become a popular guide for understanding mr putin s motif it ha also turned it swiss italian author giuliano da empoli into a coveted kremlinologist invited to lunch with the french prime minister and to france s top morning news show to analyze the war s development the success ha illustrated the continued power of literature in france where novel have long shaped public debate lisabeth borne the prime minister said through a spokesman that she really enjoyed his book which mix fiction and reality and echo international current event and the war in ukraine but in a country where literary hit are a kind of rorschach test the novel s success ha also raised concern about whether it is shaping france s view on russia it detractor say the book conveys a largely sympathetic portrayal of mr putin that may influence policy in a country that is already chastised a too forgiving of the russian leader the wizard of the kremlin which at time read like an essay is built around a fictionalized account of a powerful longtime putin aide musing on western decadence the united state goal of bringing russia to it knee and russian preference for a strong leader typical kremlin talking point that critic say go unchallenged throughout the page at best the book s popularity echo what g rard araud the former french ambassador to the united state called a kind of french fascination with russia fueled by a shared history of revolution empire and cultural masterpiece at worst critic say it signal lenient view of mr putin that are enduring in france and may shape the country s stance on the war a reflected in president emmanuel macron s call not to humiliate russia the book conveys the clich s of russian propaganda with a few small nuance said c cile vaissi a political scientist specializing in russia at rennes university when i see it success that worry me dissecting politics wa nothing new to mr da empoli a former deputy mayor of florence italy and adviser to an italian prime minister he ha already published a dozen political essay in italian and french including one on barack obama s presidential run but mr da empoli wanted to try fiction and had a fascination with the way russian power is projected so he modeled his debut novel s narrator on one of the country s most intriguing figure vladislav y surkov the challenge of the book is to take the devil s point of view mr da empoli said until recently mr surkov wa mr putin s chief ideologist and one of the architect of the extreme centralized control exerted by mr putin earning him a reputation a a puppet master and the title putin s rasputin the character s rather novelistic nature struck me said mr da empoli a soft spoken restrained year old who now teach at science po university in paris he added that he had visited russia four time and had read numerous essay on the country s politics and the putin regime during his research the narrator chronicle the inner working of mr putin s government he cross path with real life kremlin player like yevgeny v prigozhin the founder of the infamous wagner mercenary group with whom he set up troll farm to spread disinformation and division in the west mr da empoli handed in his manuscript to gallimard his publisher two year ago he said he did not expect much for his first attempt at fiction then came russia s invasion of ukraine the novel which had long been scheduled for publication in the spring wa one of the first new look at mr putin it soon became the talk of the town i don t go to a dinner or a lunch without offering the book said h l ne carr re d encausse a specialist in russian history who ha condemned the war but who ha also previously defended

power mr da empoli wa invited on every talk show to analyze the current conflict circumstance have obviously changed the way the book wa received said mr da empoli who see his novel more a political fiction than a a guide to understanding russia i didn t necessarily expect that he wa not the only one surprised several russia expert have expressed dismay at the novel s enthusiastic reception they say the book is mostly indulgent about mr putin portraying him a fighting oligarch for the good of the people and putting russia back on it foot in the face of western contempt in one passage the narrator describes the pride of russian upon learning that mr putin had paid a surprise visit to troop fighting in chechnya on jan his first day a president there wa a leader in charge again he say fran oise thom a professor of russian history at the sorbonne said these description completely conceal the sordid dimension of the putin reality and are very close to the russian propaganda image m vaissi the political scientist put it more bluntly it s a bit like russia today for saint germain de pr s she said referring to the kremlin funded television channel and the paris redoubt of the french literary elite several french diplomat disagreed arguing that the novel if anything is a useful look into the thinking of the putin government we have to hear this speech too said sylvie bermann a former french ambassador in moscow it doesn t mean that we agree with it french right wing group have long sung mr putin s praise and prominent intellectual like m carr re d encausse have endorsed the kremlin s view that the west humiliated russia after the end of the cold war under normal circumstance the wizard of the kremlin might have fueled a harmless literary quarrel of the sort that periodically grip france but not in a time of war the argument over the book are occurring just when division persist in europe over how to deal with mr putin while eastern european country like poland say he must be defeated outright western european nation like france have wavered between unequivocal financial and military support of ukraine and reaching out to mr putin this book ha become almost a textbook of history and politics for french leader said alexandre melnik a former russian diplomat who opposes mr putin he pointed to mr macron s remark that appeared sympathetic to russia s grievance three presidential adviser declined to say or said they did not know whether mr macron had read the novel mr v drine the former foreign minister who ha sometimes advised mr macron on russia acknowledged that if the french president read the book it would not lead him to adopt an aggressive stance toward russia he added that he saw a medium term benefit to the book s popularity making the case for reaching out to mr putin when it will be acceptable the wizard of the kremlin wa released in italian this past summer selling about copy and earning praise in italy a a great novel nearly translation have been released or are on their way including into english but not into russian or ukrainian so far mr da empoli said that his only aim wa to write a credible novel nothing more the

subjugate them one way or another and exploit their resource for it own benefit the russian diplomat said he mentioned a an example a bill introduced in the u congress which seek to create a strategy

tragic and the most hopeful for diplomacy last year and the one that the entire world should hear now the foreign minister seemed amused by the request for poetic commentary and remarked that his department usually dealt with concrete matter but agreed to answer anyway he picked war a the most tragic word because the crisis in ukraine is our response to the hybrid war that wa unleashed upon u

the ceasefire lasted until jan though report indicated that russia continued fighting at routine level during the hour period fox news digital s paul best and reuters contributed to this report washington for year the united state ha insisted that crimea is still part of ukraine yet the biden administration ha held to a hard line since russia s invasion of ukraine refusing to provide kyiv with the weapon it need to target the crimean peninsula which russia ha been using a a base for launching devastating strike now that line is starting to soften after month of discussion with ukrainian official the biden administration is finally starting to concede that kyiv may need the power to strike the russian sanctuary even if such a move increase the risk of escalation according to several u s official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discus the sensitive debate crimea between the black sea and the sea of azov is home to ten of thousand of dug in russian troop and numerous russian military base white house official insist there is no change in position crimea they say belongs to ukraine we have said throughout the war that crimea is ukraine and ukraine ha the right to defend themselves and their sovereign territory in their internationally recognized border said adrienne watson a spokeswoman for the national security council privately military and administration official had questioned the utility of ukraine focusing attack on crimea arguing kyiv s military had better target elsewhere on the battlefield but the biden administration ha come to believe that if the ukrainian military can show russia that it control of crimea can be threatened that would strengthen kyiv s position in any future negotiation in addition fear that the kremlin would retaliate using a tactical nuclear weapon have dimmed u s official and expert said though they cautioned that the risk remained the new thinking on crimea annexed illegally by russia in show how far biden administration official have come from the start of the war when they were wary of even acknowledging publicly that the united state wa providing stinger antiaircraft missile for ukrainian troop but over the course of the conflict the united state and it nato ally have been steadily loosening the handcuff they put on themselves moving from providing javelin and stinger to advanced missile system patriot air defense system armored fighting vehicle and even some western tank to give ukraine the capacity to strike against russia s onslaught now the biden administration is considering what would be one of it boldest move yet helping ukraine to attack the peninsula that president vladimir v putin view a an integral part of his quest to restore past russian glory american official are discussing with their ukrainian counterpart the use of american supplied weapon from himars rocket system to bradley fighting vehicle to possibly target mr putin s hard fought control over a land bridge that function a a critical supply route connecting crimea to russia via the russian occupied city of melitopol and mariupol however president biden is not yet ready to give ukraine the long range missile system that kyiv would need to attack russian installation on the peninsula ukrainian official have long insisted that crimea is an important target for their attack and that continuing military pressure on russian base there is a significant part of their strategy ukrainian military official have also discussed with american official the importance of increasing pressure on russia s rear echelon in crimea which support military operation elsewhere in ukraine with the black sea fleet a major russian air base command post and logistics hub supporting russian operation in southern ukraine the peninsula represents a major focus in kyiv s battle plan in deciding to give the bradley to ukraine the biden administration moved closer to providing kyiv with something for which senior ukrainian official have been imploring the united state for month direct american help for ukraine to go on the offense including targeting crimea the bradley are armored personnel carrier mounted with powerful millimeter gun and guided missile that can take on russian tank frederick b hodges a retired lieutenant general and former top u s army commander in europe said that in the coming month the bradley could be used by ukrainian troop to help sever the land bridge being able to rely on military base in crimea for staging wa the primary reason russian force were able to seize land in southern ukraine last year a u s official said making those force le capable is a key battlefield goal of the ukrainian ukraine could use bradley to move force down major road such a the m which connects kherson melitopol and mariupol added seth g jones a senior vice president at the center for strategic and international study any ukrainian infantry advancing through these area would face significant fire from russian position and bradley offer helpful firepower and protection for troop the bradley along with british tank and the armored combat vehicle that france and germany have agreed to send could be the vanguard of an armored force that ukraine could employ in a counteroffensive this winter or spring government and independent analyst say we think now is the right time to intensify our support for ukraine britain s foreign secretary james cleverly said tuesday while on a visit to washington we can t allow this to drag on and become a kind of first world war attritional type stalemate the british defense ministry said in a twitter message last week that in recent week russia had bolstered defensive fortification in central zaporizhzhia a province in southern ukraine near the land bridge and where russia maintains a large force if ukraine doe focus on reclaiming zaporizhzhia then preliminary attack could include hitting target in nearby crimea a major ukrainian breakthrough in zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of russia s land bridge the british assessment said ukraine also ha american provided himars long range rocket system with the reclaiming last year of kherson in the south ukrainian forward line can now use them to hit the main supply route coming out of crimea one american military official said in an interview this week top u s and ukrainian commander will hold a high level planning meeting in germany to game out the offensive planning another senior u s official said the drill the official said is meant to align ukraine s battle plan with the kind of weapon and supply nato ally are contributing ukrainian official fear their country cannot survive year of a stalemated conflict while russia continues to pound city and town so they see little choice but to target crimea and put it in jeopardy a senior u s official said noting that the issue ha come up at recent high level meeting at the white house still despite the additional weaponry the biden administration doe not think that ukraine can take crimea militarily and indeed there are still worry that such a move could drive mr putin to retaliate with an escalatory response but official said their assessment now is that russia need to believe that crimea is at risk in part to strengthen ukraine s position in any future negotiation by demonstrating an ability to strike in crimea american official say ukraine could show that russian control is not established the biden administration also increasingly belief that hitting russia s rear line coming out of crimea could severely damage moscow s ability to push it front line further official say without crimea the whole thing fall apart said evelyn farkas the top pentagon official for ukraine during the obama administration contributing to the shifting thinking is a dampening of fear that targeting crimea would drive mr putin to use a tactical nuclear weapon official say it feel to me like increasingly the administration is recognizing that the threat of russian escalation is perhaps not what they thought it wa earlier general hodges said while ukrainian strike inside russia proper still bring escalatory concern from u s official moscow s reaction to periodic ukrainian special operation or covert attack in crimea including against russian air base command post and ship in the black sea fleet ha been tempered there is more clarity on their tolerance for damage and attack said dara massicot a senior policy researcher at the rand corporation crimea ha already been hit many time without a massive escalation from the kremlin still mr putin and the russian public view crimea a part of russia so strike there could solidify russian support for the war for their part u s official say they do not know how mr putin will react if ukraine attack crimea using american supplied weapon m massicot said none of ukraine s handful of attack on crimea so far have threatened russia s ability to maintain it claim on the peninsula so they may not be an accurate test of russia s resolve on this point she said last month secretary of state antony j blinken reiterated standing american policy on ukraine that the biden administration wa seeking to help the country take back territory seized during and after the russian invasion last year our focus is on continuing to do what we ve been doing which is to make sure that ukraine ha in it hand what it need to defend itself what it need to push back against the russian aggression to take back territory that s been seized from it since feb mr blinken told the wall street journal ceo council summit by mr blinken s definition that territory doe not include crimea that position critic say ha largely given the russian military an untouchable sanctuary from which to attack ukraine we have in essence put limit on ukraine saying this war is going to be fought on your soil and not on russian soil said philip breedlove a retired four star air force general who wa nato s supreme allied commander for europe when russia invaded crimea in to give russia sanctuary from which to fight without fear of reproach is absolutely absurd it make no military sense president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine made a passionate appeal by video on wednesday to head of state and other decision maker gathered at the world economic forum in davos switzerland urging a faster pace of support for his country in the face of russia s invasion at the start of mr zelensky s address which he delivered in english he called for a minute of silence to honor ukraine s minister of internal affair denys monastyrsky and more than a dozen others who were killed in a helicopter crash near kyiv ukraine s capital earlier on wednesday he called the crash whose cause is being investigated a tragedy and another example of the unnecessary death that have marked the conflict too often he said ukraine found itself racing against time tragedy are outpacing life the tyranny is outpacing democracy mr zelensky said the time the free world u to think is used by the terrorist state to kill it had taken only second for russian tank to roll across the border last february mr zelensky said but day before sanction were imposed a russian missile he said traveled across the country in minute before striking a building in the city of dnipro on saturday killing people the supplying of ukraine with air defense system must outpace russia s next missile attack he said the supply of western tank must outpace the next invasion of russian tank mr zelensky ha pressed his country s case before many international group including the united nation general assembly congress the european parliament and the group of nation only the address to congress wa made in person others are also making appeal for ukraine at davos the country s first lady olena zelenska spoke on monday and vitali klitschko the mayor of kyiv is there with his brother wladimir klitschko a fellow former heavyweight boxing champion mr zelensky ha repeatedly argued that moscow felt empowered to invade ukraine in part because of the limited international response to russia s invasion in during which it annexed the crimean peninsula and set up two breakaway republic in the eastern region of donbas on wednesday he sought to set the war in the context of a struggle for democratic value we routinely defend value that some of our ally take for granted a a fact of life he said at first the world underestimate a threat then it unites to resist it and then the world win mr zelensky spoke during a critical week of diplomacy a ukraine push for more advanced arm including tank and air defense missile on tuesday the netherlands said that it intended to follow the united state and germany

greg norman is a reporter at fox news digital much good would come from the defeat of vladimir putin in ukraine it would prevent future russian aggression in europe and deter chinese expansionism by demonstrating western resolve and lethality it is essential however that in providing ukraine with the support it need washington doe it in a way that provides full accountability to the american people and neither add major unfunded liability for the u s taxpayer nor consumes resource required to counter the people s republic of china retaining the ability to confront russia and china simultaneously will require some of our european ally to do more toward supporting the effort in ukraine this will enable the u s to shoulder the bulk of the load deterring china in the pacific for the united state victory would be a putin regime that is unable to mount a subsequent attack on a nato country that could obligate our direct involvement in a european war president biden should lay out a strategy to insulate the american people and our ally from the fallout of putin s energy war this will require maximizing our production of and access to reliable fuel oil coal natural gas nuclear and constructing pipeline and export terminal to move fuel where they are needed for domestic consumption and export president biden ha justified restricting certain military aid to ukraine in the hope of preventing putin from using a nuclear weapon but this only allows putin to hold our aid hostage with nuclear threat a he ha been doing since the beginning of the war the prc will not be a constructive partner of any sort on ukraine but beijing could help dissuade putin from using a nuclear weapon if they believe it would harm their own interest president biden ha politicized the ukraine issue in congress ukrainian leadership could help restore bipartisan support for assistance to the war effort by more actively engaging with congressional conservative and addressing their concern about corruption and a drift into endless war congress should set the term for reconstruction if ukraine expects american taxpayer investment or u s government support for american entity that participate in the reconstruction process all american need to hear directly and unequivocally from president zelenskyy that their money will not be spent on contract with prc entity or to free up other resource for this purpose many american remain unconvinced that continued engagement in ukraine is in our vital national interest the burden is on the biden administration to make this case currently le than half of the country approve of the way he is handling the situation if president biden refuse to work closely with conservative on capitol hill on ukraine strategy he risk undermining a year of concerted u s engagement allowing putin to regroup for potential future aggression and failing to deter china all of which would be a sad waste of the billion already committed

second major store of weapon the u s ha begun to drain a it ha also turned to store in south korea in recent month the location of the store is politically sensitive however a both israel and south korea have vowed not to provide lethal aid to ukraine neither of the country ha officially broken that promise but some fear russia could argue that allowing the u s to siphon arm from their stockpile

based on russia s security concern speaking at an annual press conference lavrov wa asked whether the current phase of hostility in the neighboring state could end this year he responded by noting that the goal of the special military operation are not fictional not plucked out of thin air but are rather defined by fundamental legitimate security interest of the russian federation he said this wa especially true when it come to the situation in neighboring country ukraine like any other territory bordering russia of course should not host military infrastructure that pose a direct threat to our country lavrov also said ukraine should not discriminate against and harass it citizen who want to continue to speak russian and maintain russian culture and tradition he stated that this is

in september polish president andrzej duda spoke during the world economic forum in davos about the essence of the latest conversation with zelensky either they communicated without interpreter or duda did not understand something or zelensky began to express himself in the manner characteristic of the mayor of the ukrainian capital vitaly zlatoust klitschko but the essence of the conversation resembles an attempt to find common ground between an alcoholic and a drug addict we talked about the future nato summit in vilnius and told volodymyr zelensky that we can assure him that nato s door are still open to ukraine that we support future nato membership duda told reporter vladimir said guy thank you i m grateful but honestly i don t want to hear the same story again i need guarantee i can understand that now you cannot agree to full membership in nato because we are in a conflict based on article of the north atlantic treaty this is impossible but i need guarantee for my country i need security guarantee please talk to the member of the alliance because we need it immediately what wa that zelensky with a stream of the unconscious or duda who distorted the word of the president of ukraine what guarantee can anyone provide to the country and even security guarantee while the conflict is in full swing after all it seems that this is not about the implementation of some promise in the future zelensky need guarantee here and now perhaps after all zelensky spoke not about promise but about strict guarantee of ukraine s accession to nato within some insignificant period after the end of the conflict most likely it wa but in this case zelensky act a a complete profane in politics if he belief that the only obstacle to ukraine s accession to nato is the th article of the nato charter which obliges the member of the bloc to consider how they can help to protect a member state of the alliance that is subject to external aggression from a third party and if possible to organize this assistance no one by and large wanted to see ukraine a a member of the alliance even in peacetime because there are more problem and loss from it than from profit what can we say about the current situation when there is almost a splinter left of that country the future of which is very doubtful in the prospect of it existence at least within some border strictly speaking this wa confirmed by zelensky himself during an online speech at the forum security guarantee are one of the main priority for u zelensky said answering a question from a cnn correspondent we understand that at the moment we are not there yet unfortunately russia understands this well and they are doing everything possible so that it is not easy for u to join but we are on the way to nato because nato is the best guarantee of security for u for our country for our child nato is the best guarantee for ukraine s security and ukraine for nato what well except for the fact that you always have to spend money weapon ammunition from your arsenal on it then why accept it into the alliance and have any obligation to it except of course permanent loss in addition to these liability even a such a boy whom adult hooligan send to a neighboring yard for provocation ukraine could not fulfill it function completely since the victim of aggression failed to organize a united front against the aggressor state in the world russia ha already earned a place among terrorist zelensky said at the end of his speech and admitted that this point of view is not shared by everyone our priority today our political task today is to see different political figure and figure those who are still very relevant or were relevant until recently so that they recognize it a russia s aggression taking into account the fact that only olaf scholz is present at the forum of the top official of the same group of seven and many state sent delegation formed on a formal basis no matter who wa the ukrainian delegation also failed to fulfill this task a by the way most likely zelensky s wife failed to whom her husband instructed to transfer his personal letter to the head of the prc xi jinping in davos because there wa no comrade xi in davos he wa not going there and the prc is now represented there by some deputy prime minister from among the downed pilot because on his return from switzerland to china he resigns it would be better if zelensky the right word would have sent olena to buy something for the wardrobe in the boutique of davos they say that they are no worse there than in paris where she

collaborate with international investigator into potential war crime committed by wagner a major paramilitary force at the center of the kremlin s war effort in ukraine mr risnes the lawyer said mr

journalist starting friday people will have to present ration card to buy rice pasta buckwheat or sugar russia s invasion of ukraine ha reshaped relation around the globe perhaps nowhere more clearly than on the boundary between europe and asia strengthening the hand of turkey and iran now important source of trade and weapon for moscow while undermining russian influence in the caucasus armenia is part of the russian led military alliance of six post soviet country the collective security treaty organization and host a russian military base but so far the kremlin with it hand full in ukraine ha not taken action to aid it ally the whole concentration of attention on ukraine make the situation more fragile and give a new opportunity to azerbaijan to use force and be more aggressive vahan kostanyan an adviser to armenia s foreign minister said in a recent interview armenia won a war against azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh in the early s giving it control of some percent of azerbaijan s total land area including nagorno karabakh azerbaijan won much of it back when it launched an offensive in taking advantage of it natural gas profit to buy superior weaponry from turkey and israel the recent war ended after day with the cease fire negotiated by mr putin and russian troop were deployed to protect the armenian remaining in and around stepanakert the region s biggest city and the road connecting it to armenia now some armenian believe azerbaijan is intent on starving them out with the roadblock this is so that we leave our homeland m azizyan the journalist in armenian populated nagorno karabakh said in a phone interview that is their goal president ilham aliyev of azerbaijan said last week that whoever doe not want to become our citizen the road is not closed it is open they can leave whenever they want russia s leverage is waning in both country in azerbaijan the ukraine invasion turned public opinion further against russia and it peacekeeping contingent said zaur shiriyev a crisis group analyst in baku in armenia russia s military support look le advantageous with russia no longer a prolific exporter of weaponry it need it in ukraine and with mr putin keen to preserve close tie with turkey azerbaijan s main ally tigran grigoryan an armenian political analyst said the war in ukraine had created an environment in which the russian deterrent isn t working in the region there is little clarity on how the current crisis can be resolved azerbaijan insists it ha not imposed a blockade on nagorno karabakh and that humanitarian and medical traffic is being let through but on the ground the situation appears increasingly dire for armenian in nagorno karabakh who are stranded with limited food and other essential and cut off from family member who were in armenia when the crisis began m azizyan said she recently braved a six hour line at an a t m and that thing a simple a orange cheese or fever reducing drug have become prized possession kindergarten are closed she said because of a lack of food after russian peacekeeping troop were filmed recently handing out humanitarian aid outside a local maternity clinic resident split into two camp on social medium she said some thanked the russian while others asked why they weren t doing more no one understands m azizyan said why russia is not able to reopen the road people have started to get angry and to express their indignation toward the peacekeeper while azerbaijan won the war it still ha not achieved all it aim including a transportation corridor to the azerbaijani exclave of nakhchivan a separate slice of azerbaijani territory on armenia s southwestern border that would give the country a direct link to turkey it is also seeking to exert greater control over the road that is now being blocked known a the lachin corridor claiming that armenia is using it to illegally transport land mine into the territory russia ha been trying to tread a middle path amid the escalation while armenia is a military ally mr aliyev ha developed a close relationship with mr putin and both country are important economic partner for russia amid western sanction we call on the azerbaijani and armenian side to demonstrate good will and to seek compromise together maria v zakharova the russian foreign ministry s spokeswoman said last week the kremlin continues to keep a hand in the negotiation between azerbaijan and armenia and mr putin spoke with mr aliyev and with prime minister nikol pashinyan of armenia in december in st petersburg in televised remark at his meeting with mr putin mr pashinyan noted with apparent frustration that it turn out that the lachin corridor is not under the control of russian peacekeeper last week mr pashinyan went further in pushing back against moscow canceling planned military drill in armenia this year by the russia led alliance russia s military presence in armenia not only fails to guarantee it security but it raise security threat for armenia mr pashinyan said according to the associated press but analyst say that there is little chance that armenia will be able to disentangle itself from it reliance on russia anytime soon the latest in a series of lesson for post soviet country about the difficulty of moving out of moscow s security shadow especially when instability threatens in belarus in and kazakhstan last year leader of former soviet country turned to mr putin for help in the face of popular uprising reinforcing his sway over both nation armenia ha a massive strategic problem said thomas de waal a senior fellow at carnegie europe who ha studied the conflict for decade mr pashinyan would like a much more balanced foreign policy and yet he s stuck with russia a his main military political ally still with moscow distracted the european union and the united state have heightened their own effort to broker a lasting peace and to build their influence in the caucasus mr pashinyan and mr aliyev met last august and last october in meeting arranged by the european union and the two country foreign minister met in washington in november analyst described the dual negotiating track a unusual one led by russia the other by the e u at a time when moscow and the west are locked in their most intense conflict in decade but the e u s special representative for the southern caucasus toivo klaar said in an interview that he ha been in contact with his russian counterpart the diplomat igor khovayev and held two in person meeting with him last fall in the current circumstance there s potentially more space for armenia and azerbaijan to actually overcome their conflict mr klaar said the question is whether they re able to seize that opportunity washington prime minister mark rutte of the netherlands said on tuesday that his country wa considering sending a patriot missile system to ukraine a move that would bolster kyiv s air defense and help repel russian strike mr rutte seated next to president biden in the oval office said that a russian attack on the city of dnipro which killed dozen of people in one residential building had strengthened our resolve to stay with ukraine amid deepening concern over the ukrainian ability to withstand another possible offensive by moscow we have the intention to join what you are doing with germany on the patriot project so the air defense system mr rutte told mr biden i think that it s important we join that and i discussed it also this morning with olaf scholz of germany it wa unclear whether the dutch had formally committed to sending the system the defense department and the white house did not say whether a firm commitment had been made though one administration official said a formal decision wa expected the dutch foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment mr rutte is the latest foreign leader to visit washington a mr biden work to shore up a number of crucial global alliance he belief can help counter rising aggression from russia and china on friday prime minister fumio kishida of japan met with mr biden and the two leader promised to work together to improve japan s military posture and denounced the russian invasion of ukraine mr biden ha also tried to persuade the dutch and the japanese to sign on to american effort to curb china s access to semiconductor that could advance it own military technology in recent day the attack on dnipro have increased pressure on western nation to do more to supply kyiv with economic and military aid mr rutte s interest in sending a patriot system follows a decision in late december by american official to supply and train ukrainian troop on tuesday afternoon president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said on twitter that he wa grateful to the dutch prime minister for the intention to provide patriot air defense system to ukraine it greatly improves air defense protects our city people from rf s missile terror he said referring to the russian federation but pressure ha also grown on germany and the united state to follow britain s lead in pledging to send tank to ukraine though neither government ha said it would do so on tuesday mr biden spoke to mr scholz the german chancellor by phone the two leader discussed their steadfast support to ukraine and condemned russia s aggression according to a readout from the administration aside from encouraging a united front against russia mr biden ha hoped that meeting with leader in person can help build support for the sweeping restriction his administration made in october on the sale to china of chip and the tool that can be used to make them american official believe the technology can be used to power supercomputer and weapon system that might one day threaten the united state u s official have for several year been in talk with the netherlands and japan maker of the world s most advanced equipment for manufacturing semiconductor to limit the kind of technology they sell to china the restriction put in place by the biden administration included limit on foreign made chip that are manufactured with u s technology but the united state stopped short of regulating foreign made manufacturing equipment like that produced by the dutch firm asml the united state make much of the most advanced equipment needed by global semiconductor factory known a fabs in the short term the new restriction have been like punching a hole into every chip fab in china that meet the technical specification of the rule said emily kilcrease a senior fellow at the center for a new american security but the measure could prove to be le effective over time she said if foreign company like asml or japan s tokyo electron are lured by china s huge market into trying to develop and sell their own version of u s technology if there are other country that are not subject to the same level of control there s this really strong structural incentive for these foreign company to develop alternative to u s technology m kilcrease said american company say the measure will put them at a disadvantage compared with foreign competitor lam research a chip making technology provider forecast a revenue hit of billion to billion this year applied material another equipment company ha given similar estimate the biden administration had hoped to issue it october rule in tandem with ally and had spent month in discussion with them including the netherlands japan south korea israel and britain but while many of these government recognize beijing a a rising national security threat they have been reluctant to cut off important commerce with china in both japan and the netherlands there have been question about the legal authority to issue restriction like the united state a well a extensive technical discussion about which precise technology to restrict gregory allen a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international study said foreign government appeared to be pushing for the agreement to be broadened further to include country like south korea and germany to make sure they are not put at a commercial disadvantage by joining with the united state washington the pentagon is tapping into a vast but little known stockpile of american ammunition in israel to help meet ukraine s dire need for artillery shell in the war with russia american and israeli official say the stockpile provides arm and ammunition for the pentagon to use in middle east conflict the united state ha also allowed israel to access the supply in emergency the ukraine conflict ha become an artillery driven war of attrition with each side lobbing thousand of shell every day ukraine ha run low on munition for it soviet era weaponry and ha largely shifted to firing artillery and round donated by the united state and other western ally artillery constitutes the backbone of ground combat firepower for both ukraine and russia and the war s outcome may hinge on which side run out of ammunition first military analyst say with stockpile in the united state strained and american arm maker not yet able to keep up with the pace of ukraine s battlefield operation the pentagon ha turned to two alternative supply of shell to bridge the gap one in south korea and the one in israel whose use in the ukraine war ha not been previously reported the shipment of hundred of thousand of artillery shell from the two stockpile to help sustain ukraine s war effort is a story about the limit of america s industrial base and the diplomatic sensitivity of two vital u s ally that have publicly committed not to send lethal military aid to ukraine israel ha consistently refused to supply weapon to ukraine out of fear of damaging relation with moscow and initially expressed concern about appearing complicit in arming ukraine if the pentagon drew it munition from the stockpile about half of the round destined for ukraine have already been shipped to europe and will eventually be delivered through poland israeli and american official said a senior defense and military official from dozen of nation including nato state prepare to meet at ramstein air base in germany on friday to discus sending ukraine more tank and other arm u s official have been scrambling behind the scene to cobble together enough shell to keep kyiv sufficiently supplied this year including through an anticipated spring offensive with the front line now mostly stationary artillery ha become the most important combat arm mark f cancian a former white house weapon strategist said in a new study for the center for strategic and international study in washington where he is a senior adviser another analysis published last month by the foreign policy research institute said that if ukraine continued to receive a steady supply of ammunition particularly for artillery a well a spare part it would stand a good chance of wresting back more territory that russia had seized the question is whether these advantage will prove sufficient for ukrainian force to retake territory from entrenched russian troop wrote rob lee and michael kofman leading military analyst arming the ukrainian military with enough artillery ammunition is part of a larger american led effort to increase it overall combat power by also providing more precision long range weapon western tank and armored fighting vehicle and combined arm training the united state ha so far sent or pledged to send ukraine just over one million millimeter shell a sizable portion of that though le than half ha come from the stockpile in israel and south korea a senior u s official said speaking on the condition of anonymity to discus operational matter other western country including germany canada estonia and italy have sent millimeter shell to ukraine the ukrainian army u about artillery round a month about twice the rate they are being manufactured by the united state and european country combined u s and western official say the rest must come from other source including existing stockpile or commercial sale mr kofman said in an interview that without adjustment to how the ukrainian military fight future ukrainian offensive might require significantly more artillery ammunition to make progress against entrenched russian defense the u s is making up the difference from it stockpile but that s doubtfully a sustainable solution said mr kofman who is the director of russian study at cna a research institute in arlington va it mean the u s is taking on risk elsewhere pentagon official say they must ensure that even a they arm ukraine american stockpile do not dip to dangerously low level according to two senior israeli official the united state ha promised israel that it will replenish what it take from the warehouse in it territory and would immediately ship ammunition in a severe emergency we are confident that we will continue to be able to support ukraine for a long a it take brig gen patrick ryder the pentagon spokesman told reporter last week and we re confident that we ll be able to continue to maintain the readiness level that are vital to defending our nation general ryder told the new york time in a statement on tuesday that the pentagon will not discus the location or unit providing the equipment or materiel citing operational security reason and those war reserve stockpile are playing a pivotal role when last year the pentagon first raised the idea of withdrawing munition from the stockpile israeli official expressed concern about moscow s reaction israel ha imposed a near total embargo on selling weapon to ukraine fearing that russia might retaliate by using it force in syria to limit israeli airstrikes aimed at iranian and hezbollah force there israel s relationship with russia ha come under close scrutiny since russia s invasion of ukraine last february and ukrainian official have called out israel s government for offering their country only limited support and bowing to russian pressure a the war dragged on the pentagon and the israeli reached an agreement to move about millimeter shell israeli and american official said the american desire to move the munition wa officially submitted in an encrypted phone conversation between the u s secretary of defense lloyd j austin iii and benny gantz the israeli minister of defense at the time according to an israeli official who wa briefed on the detail of the conversation mr gantz brought the issue to the israeli cabinet the official asked to hear the opinion of the defense establishment whose representative recommended accepting the plan to avoid tension with the united state in part because the ammunition wa american property yair lapid then the prime minister approved the request at the end of the discussion the israeli official said that israel had not changed it policy of not providing ukraine with lethal weapon and rather wa acceding to an american decision to use it own ammunition a it saw fit based on a u s request certain equipment wa transferred to the u s d o d from it stockpile in israel a spokesman for the israeli defense force said in a statement referring to the department of defense the stockpile of american military hardware and munition in israel ha it origin in the arab israeli war which saw the united state airlifting weapon to resupply israeli force after the war the united state established warehouse in israel so that it could rely on them if it were again caught in a crisis a strategic memorandum signed by the two country in the s paved the way for the pre positioning of pentagon asset in israel according to two former u s official and a former senior israeli military officer with direct knowledge of the agreement american tank and armored personnel carrier were initially moved to israel s southern desert with the understanding that they would be used by u s force in the region if needed said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discus sensitive internal deliberation in the s the program wa expanded to include munition for the u s army navy and air force all stored in separate location accessible only to american military personnel according to a former u s arm inspector at the time the stockpile officially called the wrsa i or war reserve stock for ally israel wa overseen by the u s european command but it is now managed by the u s central command following a redrawing of it area of responsibility in september israel wa allowed to withdraw american munition from the stockpile during it war with hezbollah in the summer of and again during operation against hamas in the gaza strip in according to a congressional research service report released in february the pentagon also approached south korea last year about transferring munition in the u s stockpile there to ukraine the south korean were more willing than the israeli to work with the united state on using the stock a senior u s official said but they also objected to shipping artillery shell directly to ukraine though for different reason the official said the south korean government did not want artillery round marked r o k republic of korea showing up in ukraine in violation of south korean arm export rule a compromise wa reached artillery shell from the korean stockpile would be sent to replenish american stock elsewhere the united state ha also agreed to buy new artillery shell from south korea a deal previously reported by the wall street journal u s official say that accessing the overseas stock will help tide over the ukrainian until american ammunition maker can ramp up their production other factor may ease the pressure for more shell russia s artillery fire ha reduced sharply in recent week pentagon official said possibly reflecting rationing of round because of low supply white house official said in november that north korea wa shipping artillery shell to russia another sign of likely munition shortage u s official said finally the united state is helping ukraine use ammunition more efficiently the ukrainian have been firing so many artillery barrage that about a third of the millimeter howitzer provided by the united state and other western nation are out of commission for repair over the summer during intense fighting between ukraine and russia in the eastern region of donbas pentagon official gathered satellite imagery that showed the devastation wrought on farmland between the two force trench line field had been transformed into moonscapes pitted and pocked with thousand of crater shell since then american official have leaned on ukrainian to use their artillery more judiciously and the arrival of precision rocket artillery like himars rocket artillery ha

marginalized community the award were established in this year judge at the library association chose the winner from more than nomination former verkhovna rada deputy and ex leader of the opposition platform for life party viktor medvedchuk who wa recently released from ukrainian captivity published a program material on relation between russia and ukraine in izvestia the main thing that the politician wrote about the west went against russia not because it is weak but on the contrary because it began to achieve real success writes medvedchuk russia s influence is not only discouraged but declared wrong criminal and corrupt the author say the reason for all the current trouble in his opinion is colonialism in the mind of western official russia and the united state had different goal when the cold war ended the politician note we wanted a new world without war american wanted world domination this is where the thesis come from that we can have neither political nor economic interest hence ukraine is the territory of influence of the united state nato therefore all our claim are groundless and a clear encroachment on american and nato interest moreover nato s policy also crossed out the strategy of the european union which wa engaged in the construction of a new economy even the first secretary general of the alliance hastings ismay without hiding spoke about his influence on europe medvedchuk also cite his word in his article keep the soviet union outside europe the american inside and the german in a subordinate position within ukraine itself since there have been two country anti russia and ukraine a another russia the politician writes according to him the thirst for a merger with the west and a break with russia led ukraine to the lowest economic indicator in europe anti russian sentiment brought nothing but grief and poverty to ukraine all pro western nationalist movement preach poverty and misery to the ukrainian people medvedchuk said the west ha been in charge of the anti russian vector in ukraine since from the first maidan viktor medvedchuk note it is then that the country begin to make a policy of hatred towards russia a the basis of it ideology at the same time it is clearly seen that this policy ha a cold war pattern the author note and all this wa carried out under the guise of democratic reform which were supported by all sort of western and international organization any politician who come to power in ukraine is going through an amazing transformation viktor medvedchuk note he begin a a peacemaker but eventually becomes a symbol of war this is how poroshenko behaved this is how zelensky behaves but this is how the nato leadership and many american and european politician behave the article say perhaps in order to save their country ukrainian need to start building their democracy and open their civil dialogue without western curator to sum up medvedchuk so it is necessary to create a political movement from those who have not surrendered who have not renounced their belief on pain of death and prison who do not want their country to become a place of geopolitical showdown read also ukraine is hastily moving troop russia is leading to a general battle the situation on the front line ha changed voenkor kots said that russia can take the armed force of ukraine to the cauldron near artemovsk after the capture of soledar more ukraine is creating a new religion bandera pagan in a few year it can become the main one in kiev where ru wa once baptized more listen also dmitry puchkov they want to expel russia from the un and take all the country s resource under external control more any russian invasion of ukraine wa long expected to play out a a kind of postmodern war defined by st century weapon like medium manipulation battlefield clouding disinformation cyberattacks false flag operation and unmarked fighter such element have featured in this war but it is traditional th century dynamic that have instead dominated shifting battle line of tank and troop urban assault struggle over air supremacy and over supply line and mass mobilization of troop and of weapon production the war s contour now nearly a year into the fighting resemble not so much those of any future war but rather those of a certain sort of conflict from decade past namely war fought between nation in which one doe not outright conquer the other such conflict have grown rarer in the period since an era often associated more with civil war insurgency and american invasion that have quickly shifted to occupation but war between nation have continued between israel and arab state iran and iraq armenia and azerbaijan india and pakistan ethiopia and eritrea these are the conflict that military historian and analyst when asked to draw parallel with the russian war in ukraine tend to cite you have these big commonality in korea for example sergey radchenko a john hopkins university historian said referring to the korean war big conventional battle bombardment of infrastructure every war is unique but certain trend that have played out across this subset of conflict including in ukraine may help to shed light on what drive week to week fighting what tends to determine victory or failure and how such war typically end or don t one after another dr radchenko said such war have started over fundamental territorial dispute that date back to the warring country founding and are therefore baked into both side very conception of their national identity this make the underlying conflict so difficult to resolve that fighting often recurs repeatedly over many decade those war have often turned perhaps more than any other factor on industrial attrition a each side strain to maintain the flow of mat riel like tank and antiaircraft munition that keep it in the fight but this work very differently from the competition over raw manpower that defined conflict like world war i touching more on matter of technology economic capacity and international diplomacy a lot of conventional war come down to attrition the analyst michael kofman said recently on the national security podcast war on the rock the side that is better able to reconstitute over time is the side that s able to sustain the war and ultimately win the conflict between russia and ukraine neatly fit that model which help to explain many of it twist and turn added mr kofman who is the director of russian study at c n a a research institute in arlington va to take one example each side s ability to take and hold territory is determined in large part by it ability to field tank and other heavy vehicle more reliably than it opponent and because air power is effective at destroying such vehicle each side s rate of attrition on the ground is determined in part by who control the sky this is consistent with other such war some analyst argue that iran ended it decade long war with iraq in the s only when it finally wrested control of the sky by the same token the question of who control the sky is determined in large part by whether ukraine can field enough anti air weaponry to keep pace with russia s ability to field aircraft that is a question of attrition too though one that is a much economic and diplomatic a it is military this help explain why ukraine whose production could hardly keep pace even before russia began bombing it factory ha focused so much on winning western military aid why western government have focused so tightly on constraining russia s economy and why russian force have launched so many strike on ukrainian city which both degrades ukrainian industry down to even the functioning of it electrical grid a well a force ukraine to relocate some air defense from the front line to city far removed from the battlefield all of these on some level are front in the war of industrial attrition this too parallel other such war for instance the korean war in which u s led air attack devastated north korean city in a manner not unlike and often exceeding russia s strike campaign in ukraine one lesson of those conflict is that a each side grows desperate to keep pace with the other it go to ever greater length to win international support that can prolong the war when it favor the aggressor a did american and saudi support for iraq s attempted invasion of iran it can help decide the war s outcome a happened in some conflict amid the breakup of yugoslavia where western support for one side ultimately exceeded russian support for the other it can also reshape global politics more broadly the geopolitical line set by the korean war in which the north won soviet and chinese support against the u s backed south are still largely in place year later the yom kippur war come to mind dr radchenko the historian said of russia s invasion of ukraine referring to the arab israeli war of the coalition of arab state that attacked israel sought to eject it from territory it had seized in prior round of fighting and re establish their regional dominance much a moscow is seeking to reimpose ukraine within it orbit and more broadly reconstitute some of it soviet era power within europe in his speech announcing the invasion vladimir v putin russia s president even described it a a war to reverse what he considered to be the historical error amid the soviet union s breakup year earlier that established ukraine a an independent state this too parallel the arab coalition s repeated war with israel which date to that country s declaration of independence in on territory the arab state considered to be rightfully palestine the most recent war between israel and one of those state wa in marking year of conflict formal peace with several of those country wa declared only in the last few year and tension still remain at a low boil with others this pattern hold across many of the conventional war since world war ii a conflict over territory and power balance that began with the declaration of those modern state and that ha flared intermittently ever since armenia and azerbaijan for instance two country that also emerged out of the soviet union s breakup have fought periodic war ever since broken by long but tense cease fire india and pakistan fought their first war within month of their independence and partition in followed by three more war most recently in and repeated lower level conflict now held at a tentative nuclear peace north and south korea reached an armistice in but remain in a technical state of war with occasional flare ups and an ever present threat of all out fighting such conflict in other word have often persisted for a many a six or seven decade with peace talk minimal or nonexistent in many case some may well continue longer than that and while outright fighting may be infrequent with whatdr radchenko termed active phase lasting only a few month period of calm typically require deep international involvement to maintain american troop for instance have been garrisoned in south korea for more than year it is impossible to predict whether this represents the future for russia and ukraine though it perhaps already describes their present state the seven year before russia s invasion were marked by lower level fighting with heavy western diplomacy and support to ukraine aimed at forestalling wider conflict this pattern show that one side rarely vanquishes the other outright especially with foreign state ready to step in and it offer another lesson political change within those country rarely provides the sort of breakthrough that observer are hoping might one day lead moscow to pull back the decade long soviet invasion of afghanistan for instance only deepened with the elevation in of the reform minded leader mikhail gorbachev that russia and ukraine s war would seem to fit an old pattern at all rather than charting a new direction in warfare a had been widely predicted may offer wider lesson for the world strategic weapon have not replaced and will not replace army stephanie carvin a canadian analyst wrote in an essay on the trajectory of warfare that ha circulated widely among expert conventional force alone can seize and hold territory making them the central unit of warfare newer technology like drone or satellite communication have not altered that dynamic nor have new method such a cyberattacks or medium manipulation there s no doubt that way of waging war have evolved since the time of clausewitz with the introduction of new technology dr radchenko said referring to the prussian general from the th and th century credited with modern military theory but over and over he added what might initially get called a revolution in military affair actually play out a fairly slow change but by the same token dr carvin wrote in her essay weapon can help produce cease fire but they cannot themselves create long lasting established peace despite many attempt by large and small military power alike to develop method of warfare effective enough to force their political goal on their adversary none ha yet found a way to sidestep the hard work of negotiating a mutually acceptable peace but a lesson of the past year of warfare may be that if state are unable to come to term perhaps a with the case of russia s attitude toward ukraine because one side see the other s very independence a intolerable then even fighting to a state of mutual exhaustion might not bring peace berlin germany s defense minister christine lambrecht ha resigned after enduring a year of heavy criticism over repeated public blunder her response to the ukraine war and her government s slow rollout of a military buildup m lambrecht is the highest ranking member of chancellor olaf scholz s government to resign and her departure is likely to be seen a a blow to his reputation the chancellor had repeatedly defended the record of m lambrecht a former justice minister and a fellow member of his party the social democrat the monthslong medium focus on me a a person hardly allows for objective reporting and discussion about the serviceman and woman the german armed force and security policy decision in the interest of the citizen of germany m lambrecht said in a statement released on monday morning since taking up the post when mr scholz s government entered office last year m lambrecht had been dogged by criticism she had no previous experience of the military and opposition leader accused her of lacking interest in heading the defense ministry according to germany s best selling daily bild m lambrecht had been unable to name the different rank of the german military in an interview with the paper m lambrecht began facing public scorn at the start of russia s invasion of ukraine a germany debated sending weapon to kyiv in the early day of the invasion m lambrecht trumpeted a delivery of helmet she wa the face of the government s repeated foot dragging over sending weapon though it is likely she wa carrying out a policy largely driven by the chancellery criticism ramped up last summer when it emerged that m lambrecht had used a government helicopter to take her son on a family vacation more recently opposition party in germany have argued m lambrecht is responsible for the slow rollout of a billion euro billion defense fund part of a plan by the government to significantly bolster it military in response to the war in ukraine germany s limited store of basic ammunition mean it ha stock for only hour or day of combat the final straw appears to have been an awkward video released on new year s eve on m lambrecht s personal instagram account in it m lambrecht discussed the war in ukraine and offered seasonal greeting amid a raucous backdrop of firework in berlin critic called it distasteful and even her own ministry distanced itself from the video saying it wa a personal statement in her statement m lambrecht said that she hoped her resignation would put the public focus back where it belonged the valuable work of the soldier and the many motivated people in the area of operation must be in the foreground she said a successor ha not been announced first responder increased the death toll from russia s weekend missile strike on a ukrainian apartment building to on monday the nine

terrorist separatist and their accomplice and now to be on this new list among the same almost russian fellow citizen who oppose the criminal kiev regime and we have ten of million of them is an honor for me so my contribution to the fight against this regime is noticed by the enemy it s gratifying and inspiring my weapon is not an assault rifle or a grenade my weapon is a word printed in a book or in a newspaper said on radio or television and here you are on this stupid list just because you think differently than zelensky or arestovich they managed to close the mouth of dissident in ukraine and they will never shut up me and my like minded people for it is about a useless a if you were trying to block the dnieper with a noodle or a mop to block the sun do you want to laugh at this kiev

a penny i do not conduct any trade operation in ukraine except that year ago passing to moscow i bought a good shmat of lard and a bottle of strong moonshine on the kiev bessarabian market i do not withdraw any capital from ukraine because i do not go there and do not work and i cannot be deprived of the state award of ukraine because i simply do not have them and that s right on the entire list of sanction measure so why this formidable but absolutely useless sanction stupidity clearly it come from the mental insufficiency of those who gave rise to it whose mind is clouded by malice some former colleague and fellow ukrainian including those who shouted moskalyak to gillyak on the maidan in conversation on the phone or in correspondence by e mail i wa repeatedly reproached by the fact that i had betrayed my small homeland i have one answer my small homeland ukraine is the ukraine of gogol and kozhedub your ukraine is the ukraine of bandera and shukhevych i love the first i hate the second and with this the second i will fight with the army despite any sanction read also zelensky signed a decree on sanction against figure from russia belarus and ukraine the decision of the national security and defense council of ukraine come into force on january read more listen also special operation may end within two month more mccusker asked if there is a large phenomenon of

to be near the front and criticized military leader for staying far from the fighting on friday one of mr prigozhin s company quoted him on telegram saying that wagner faced a struggle against corruption bureaucracy and official who want to stay in their place calling this a more serious threat to his company than the united state he did not specify the official he wa referring to in a

executor of the failed plan for the initial invasion in february it wa the second time in just three month that the ministry replaced the chief of the war effort outside analyst and hawkish russian

tuesday yevgeny v prigozhin head of the wagner mercenary force said that his troop had seized control of soledar posted online a photo of himself with some of the soldier in what he said wa the town s famous salt mine and made a point of claiming that only wagner fighter had been battling there on behalf of russia but both the russian defense ministry and ukrainian commander contradicted those claim on wednesday saying that combat continued in soledar and that the town had not yet fallen the russian ministry also said it own troop were fighting there dmitri s peskov the kremlin spokesman urged journalist to wait for official announcement about whether the city had been captured adding that tactical success are certainly very important a they come at a rather expensive price neither he nor the ministry mentioned wagner or it head by name but their statement amounted to a rebuke of mr prigozhin who on wednesday reiterated his claim that his force had taken control of soledar starting with the failed attempt to seize kyiv in a lightning assault in february and march the russian war effort ha been marked by misstep reversal and heavy casualty it shifted to a slow grinding offensive concentrating on the eastern donbas that succeeded in capturing several city at high cost but then stalled then in late summer came a swift ukrainian counteroffensive that reclaimed a significant amount of occupied territory and forced a chaotic russian retreat from the northeastern kharkiv region that prompted the appointment in october of a new russian commander for the war in ukraine gen

ukraine and ordered construction of defensive line to slow ukrainian advance he also advocated and organized the orderly retreat from the southern city of kherson and surrounding area west of the dnipro river a move that military analyst said wa necessary but that mr putin wa said to have previously forbidden now general surovikin ha effectively been demoted becoming one of three deputy to general gerasimov analyst said the change showed that mr putin remains focused on projecting stability and maintaining the power balance among key ally rather than correcting the military s

policy researcher at the rand corporation in washington whatever is happening in moscow it is out of touch with what is happening on the ground in ukraine in an intelligence assessment the british defense ministry said the switch wa a clear acknowledgment that the campaign is falling short of russia s strategic goal but it said the move would meet with extreme displeasure among pro war

deputy according to a statement released today by the russian defense ministry gerasimov ha served a russia s chief of general staff for over a decade they have taken someone who is competent and replaced him with someone who is incompetent but who ha been there a long time and who ha shown that he is loyal said dara massicot senior policy researcher at the rand corporation in washington whatever is happening in moscow it is out of touch with what is happening on the ground in ukraine the shake up came after announcement this week of new delivery of weapon from the west which could strengthen ukraine s capability on the battlefield the british defence ministry said in an intelligence update that gerasimov s appointment wa a significant development in president vladimir putin s approach to the war and a clear acknowledgment that the campaign is falling short of russia s strategic goal analyst said the replacement of surovikin with a kremlin apparatchik like gerasimov showed that putin remained focused on projecting the appearance of stability the announcement wa met with derision from some nationalist russian military blogger who have compared the reshuffle to a game of

lysychansk in the donbas it would give russian force a springboard to press on toward bakhmut a ruined city that lie only mile away and is now at the center of the war but military expert say that

additional spending fox news ha exclusively obtained a letter that vance r ohio intends to send to the white house office of management and budget omb director shalanda young a detailed transparent accounting is an absolute necessity he added vance s letter point to the most recent omnibus spending bill which brought the total budget authority for ukraine and country impacted by the situation in ukraine to billion that report is due thirty day from the effective date of the bill but vance said that it wa not sufficient vance said the report should include a full accounting of total budget authority including obligation apportionment and outlay for each account the report should also include a list of country the administration considers impacted by the situation in ukraine and an accounting of budgetary resource the administration intends to provide to each of these country in response to the situation in ukraine vance wrote the latest draw down includes an array of military

patriot missile defense system the pentagon announced tuesday ukraine ha long sought the patriot surface to air guided missile defense system because it can target aircraft cruise missile and shorter range ballistic missile during his late december visit to the u s ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said the battery would make a significant difference in bolstering kyiv s defense against russia s invasion the number of ukrainian coming to fort sill is approximately the number it take to operate one battery and they will focus on learning to operate and also maintain the patriot pentagon spokesman air force gen pat ryder said tuesday kyiv s decision to take troop off the battlefield to train across the atlantic in the u s is unusual although it ha sent force for short term training at european base for other more complex system it ha received such a on the longer range high mobility artillery rocket system patriot training normally can take several month but the longer those troop are off the line they re not actually engaged in combat ryder said so the training will be shortened fort sill wa selected because it already run patriot training school ryder said the u s pledged one patriot battery in december a part of one of several large military assistance package it ha provided ukraine in recent week last week germany pledged an additional patriot battery each patriot battery consists of a truck mounted launching system with eight launcher that can hold up to four missile interceptor each a ground radar a control station and a generator the army said it currently ha patriot battalion the patriot battery will complement a variety of air defense system that both the u s and nato partner have pledged to ukraine a it face an evolving barrage of missile and drone against it civilian population and infrastructure from russia in the nearly month old conflict in the last few month germany ha pledged four iris t air defense system the u s ha also pledged

petersburg is pondering the impact of his day special military operation but there is no chance for a rodion like redemption here putin belief he is the reincarnation of russia s imperial and soviet

vanquishing napoleon stalin subjugated eastern europe and terrorized the planet putin s ethno messianism however may be putting russia on the road to oblivion the russian high command is exposed a gangster racketeer and yes men this is a cabal that with each defeat resembles more and more the cast of psychopath and dead enders who stuck it out with adolf hitler in the berlin bunker like hitler putin now seek refuge with the world s pariah in this case iran and north korea shockingly for him china ha not come to his rescue and he ha received the back of the hand from the leader of india and turkey once dismissing europe a a spent force putin s brutality ha rearranged the continent s map russia s northern force are now staring directly across at the modern and highly capable army of finland and sweden whose country have emerged from a neutral slumber to challenge their ancient enemy he will have a hard time defending decision to russian posterity that led to the revitalization of nato with poland now assuming a leadership role once coveted by germany and reinforced the primacy of the anglo american alliance no matter how indifferent the biden administration is to the historic tie between washington and london a the most reliable lasting bulwark against global tyranny karl marx s collaborator friedrich engels famously called the russian empire a prison of people ronald reagan pointed to the soviet union a the focus of evil in the modern world if the west stay the course and that is not a given with the biden administration and an appeasement chorus in berlin and paris putin s legacy will be an impoverished third world russia it is ironic the imperialist dream of the small time policeman might lead to the final death knell of the russian soviet empire dostoyevsky would have known the type robert wilkie served a the tenth secretary of veteran affair and a the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness he currently serf a distinguished fellow in the center for american security at the america first policy institute strained by the need to finance it war machine the russian government said on tuesday that it had posted a billion budget deficit in which is the second highest since the break up of the soviet union the budget gap reached trillion ruble in or percent of the size of the russian economy anton siluanov the country s finance minister said during a government meeting russia s revenue increased by trillion ruble in or billion but that wa not enough to cover rapidly increasing expenditure which skyrocketed by trillion ruble or billion official said at the meeting government official presented the economic situation a positive with mikhail mishustin the russian prime minister saying that overall those indicator aren t bad making no specific reference to the war mr silanov the finance minister said despite the geopolitical situation the restriction and sanction we have fulfilled all our planned goal still the posted deficit for is second only in russia s post soviet history to the one reported for the year the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the immediate aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine many expert predicted a catastrophic collapse of the country s economy from the western sanction and other restrictive measure yet the russian economy performed above expectation buoyed by high commodity price and some sanction like a cap of per barrel on the price for russian oil were introduced later in the year softening their effect on the economy the russian government ha not published a detailed breakdown of it expenditure in but it is widely assumed that the bulk of the rise can be attributed to increased military spending the government ha financed the deficit by issuing bond and using money from it rainy day fund a high deficit is likely for this year too russia plan to increase it military spending by a third and moscow s oil revenue are expected to be pressured by the oil price cap which compels russian trader to sell crude at a discount washington ukrainian troop are heading to the united state soon for training on the patriot missile system defense official said on tuesday in what would be an unusual case of ukrainian being trained on american soil the training will take place in fort sill okla said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity fort sill is where u s troop undergo their own training in how to operate and maintain the patriot system which is the country s most advanced ground based air defense system most of the recent training on u s weapon system for ukraine ha taken place in germany but in the case of the patriot system pentagon official had indicated that they were considering training the ukrainian in the united state brig gen pat ryder the pentagon press secretary said last week that the united state wa looking at option to include potential training here in the u s overseas or a combination of both for the biden administration the u s based training reported earlier by cnn doe not risk escalation with russia while the patriot system is a major step in continued u s aid for ukraine it is a defensive system that is meant to protect ukrainian from russian missile it is not an offensive system after month of debate the biden administration said late last month that it wa sending the patriot system to ukraine responding to kyiv s urgent request to help defend against an onslaught of russian missile and drone attack the patriot is part of a billion aid package for ukraine that wa announced last month during president volodymyr zelensky s visit to washington a patriot battery can require close to people to operate it official said while training on the complex system can take month one defense official said that he expected that ukrainian service member who had shown themselves to be quick study on military system might be able to get up to speed more quickly germany is also sending ukraine a patriot missile system from it stockpile the biden administration last week announced a billion package of military assistance for ukraine that will include bradley fighting vehicle which official said would be especially helpful to ukrainian unit fighting russian force in the donbas region in the country s east the united state ha operated training program for ukrainian troop for year it beefed up those program after russia s illegal annexation of crimea in last year the pentagon trained around two dozen ukrainian in the united state on how to use the phoenix ghost drone over the year ukrainian pilot have also trained with the california air national guard both in california and in ukraine brussels one day the war in ukraine will be over how and when remain the field of prophecy but one of the most important question will be how to ensure the future security of ukraine and by whom the possible answer are not easy and will depend on the outcome of the war but what seems clear is that short of a russian collapse and defeat with ukraine winning back all of it territory any security guarantee are likely to be both partial and fragile but without something official and analyst suggest it is hard to imagine investor pouring back into ukraine to rebuild the country or that another war would not flare in the future much pivot on the hesitancy of the west itself which want to protect ukraine but ha shown that it doe not want to fight for it and that it doe not want a direct military confrontation with russia instead it ha sought to thread a course between deterring russia but not provoking it there will be a lot of risk around the corner for european and trans atlantic unity said nathalie tocci director of the institute for international affair in rome if ukraine manages to regain even the territory lost since russia s invasion last year she said then there would be mounting voice in europe and washington saying look at the ongoing cost civilian and military hey compromise but ukraine will want solid security commitment in return she said and that could divide the west with central and eastern european country demanding nato membership for ukraine and western european ally refusing while nato and the european union have promised ukraine membership there is no deadline and it is not certain those pledge will be fulfilled the west s embrace of ukraine wa one reason cited by president vladimir v putin of russia for his invasion in the first place a long a territorial dispute remain there is little likelihood that even a ukraine in some sort of cease fire agreement with russia would win the unanimous support needed to join either institution how the war end will be crucial said thomas kleine brockhoff who helped write a paper detailing the knotty issue involved in ukraine s reconstruction even before last year s invasion he noted ukraine s sovereignty wa already compromised by russia s annexation of crimea the neatest outcome now would be if ukraine won back all of it lost territory though that is far from certain if it s a complete russian defeat then you solve the crimea problem and you have a different russia he said nato membership would then be easier to envision for ukraine and it would create a kind of untouchability even by another revisionist russian leader he said but the price to get to total victory is very high and then what the prospect of a complete defeat of russia which could undermine mr putin and his circle embodies risk of russian escalation that many nato country leader including president biden seem unwilling to hazard should mr putin s leadership collapse key european state like france and germany worry about what a chaotic nuclear armed russia could portend and even about a return to a time of trouble the year of lawlessness infighting and anarchy that russia experienced at the start of the th century but anything short of nato membership would involve promise that kyiv already considers hollow those were tried before in when the united state britain and russia itself promised ukraine territorial integrity and security assurance in return for giving up it soviet era nuclear weapon under an agreement called the budapest memorandum those assurance came with no commitment from russia of course but also from washington and london and proved worthless anders fogh rasmussen a former nato secretary general ha tried to square the circle in the kyiv security compact a proposal he and his colleague drafted in the autumn with andriy yermak the chief of staff to ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky it aim to provide something workable between the hollow assurance of and full nato and e u membership the core recommendation is for ukraine s ally to turn the country into a kind of hedgehog or a porcupine one so well armed that russia would not try to swallow it again to get there it urge a strategic partnership between ukraine and key western country on a bilateral basis for a multi decade effort to make ukraine impregnable and capable of it own defense mr rasmussen ha compared his proposal to the relationship between the united state and israel with lot of defense cooperation but no formal defense treaty in essence the proposal is alliance without membership le a security guarantee to ukraine than a major disincentive to moscow the irony is that non membership in nato would require more of the west than membership and for longer said mr kleine brockhoff others suggest that individual ally including the united state britain france germany and poland put their own troop into ukraine postwar the way nato ha put forward based multinational brigade into nato member state that border russia but significant troop presence in a non nato member would be seen in moscow a a further provocation and more evidence to fit russia s narrative that nato is trying to rip ukraine away from the russian sphere a ben hodges a retired general who commanded the u s army europe point out the united state canada and other country had troop in ukraine training the ukrainian army right up until russia s invasion when they were withdrawn to avoid a nato russian confrontation what would be their mission he asked mr hodges belief that ukraine with the right longer range weapon from a currently reluctant washington can defeat russia and take back all occupied territory including crimea by the end of august there is no way ukraine will be safe and secure so long a russia control crimea he said crimea allows russia to block the sea of azov isolate mariupol hit odesa and dominate the black sea while claiming an exclusive economic zone around crimea limiting fishing and gas exploration he said the only real security guarantee for ukraine is eventual nato membership mr hodges argued but whatever the outcome he said it must be based on the assumption that russia won t respect it unless they re forced to russia cannot be rewarded and think that what they did ha paid off with territorial gain or leverage he said but for many like camille grand a former nato assistant secretary general now with the european council on foreign relation it remains likely the war will end with russia having achieved partial objective a full defeat of russia and ukraine joining nato is only one scenario and an optimistic one he said while anything short of nato membership would be difficult to sell to the ukrainian he said russia would assume in it war plan that ukraine would be effectively part of nato much a it ha always done with sweden and finland a post conflict ukraine would provide nato the best equipped best trained and most capable army in europe in a way providing nato security guarantee not the other way around he said in a way the whole idea of security guarantee is outdated said stefano stefanini a former italian diplomat in russia and former ambassador to nato the only real guarantee of ukrainian security is nato membership he said however complicated security guarantee from major country would be tantamount to nato membership in any case he said and would inevitably carry risk when put to the test even now individual nato country refuse to send troop to aid ukraine militarily so why would they do so in the future he asked one could imagine a settlement now where ukraine loses part of it territory and a later kyiv government provokes russia in order to get it back and then seek to drag these guarantor into a conflict what would they do then even if ukraine gain nato membership it s a defensive alliance and come with restraint mr stefanini said still he said it would be a mistake to underestimate the cynical creativity of diplomat one could arrive at a point where negotiation produce a commitment for ukrainian neutrality but not disarmament with language about security guarantee even if anyone not a politician would call them unrealistic he said he made the comparison to the dayton accord that concluded the bosnian war an awkward acrobatic architecture that only served to end the war even this war will end he said and probably in negotiation total victory for anyone seems unlikely he said so at some point the diplomat will have to get creative providing ukraine some solid prospect of peace and security somehow underwritten by it ally contrary to the hope of many not only will not bring peace it will likely see the most bloodshed yet a the key warring party moscow kyiv and washington d c are all postured for decisive escalation here s why we are probably entering the hottest phase of this war the kremlin s biggest fear is the deployment of u s and nato troop into the theater in ukraine moscow military planner have previously concluded that war between russia and the united state is inevitable given that the two cold war adversary have been in a confrontation for geopolitical control over post soviet state since the collapse of the soviet union in so escalation is not an unthinkable option for putin member of the washington officialdom now openly acknowledge that arming ukraine is a low

official had spent much time debating the issue and that although it wa a difficult choice expanding the length of conscription wa necessary she also announced that the basic monthly pay for conscript

compared taiwan s military requirement to those in israel and said a discussion on mandatory training for woman could be a good next step china s bullying of taiwan permeates every part of the relationship between the two side of the taiwan strait from china blocking taiwan s participation in health conference organized by the united nation to a simulated naval blockade and live missile test after former u s speaker of the house nancy pelosi defied beijing and visited taipei in august the new conscription policy wa met with a predictable mix of emotion and opinion but somewhat surprisingly strong opposition ha been sparse and the prevailing response from both side of taiwan s main political divide ha been support for the government s move before russia s february invasion of ukraine however this would likely not have been the case ian easton author of the chinese invasion threat an influential book that examines what a china taiwan conflict might look like told fox news digital that he found the change remarkable and said only very rarely doe a liberal democracy undertake difficult reform like this in peacetime not long ago the national conscription system wa regarded a the third rail of taiwanese politics touch it and you die but now any politician in taiwan who doesn t take national security seriously is likely to be in hot water at the poll easton s observation is illustrated by enoch wu a politician with the ruling democratic progressive party dpp wu a candidate in a jan by election for a seat in taiwan s parliament made his stance clear in a may new york time op ed writing we seem to expect american son and daughter to risk their life to protect our home while relieving our own of that very duty tough word but it s a sentiment that s picked up significant traction over the last year of course not everyone in taiwan is happy about the upcoming change some parent and their son have voiced displeasure and concern when teresa chen a coffee shop owner in the southern city of kaohsiung heard the news she and her husband did the math and were relieved that their year old son would not be affected by the change i don t want him to lose a year especially a he s not interested in the military chen told fox news digital on the other side of the same taiwanese port city of almost million another set of parent sighed in resignation year old alen is now set to serve a year and while neither alen s parent nor the junior high schooler are looking forward to it they all agree there are benefit to military service from character building to better physical fitness other parent agree one taipei father told fox news digital he d rather have his son properly prepared for conflict which of course he hope never occurs a good number of people in taiwan often argue there s little point in trying to hold off a full on invasion from china a it is significantly stronger by almost every military standard but expert such a michael turton a long term taiwan based writer blogger and advocate for keeping the island s democracy free from interference from beijing say this kind of defeatist attitude is due in no small part to chinese propaganda a hidden factor is that every male now experience a program of conscription that is obviously ineffective in producing a useful military response so it the defeatist propaganda doe have some effect say turton kitsch liao assistant director of atlantic council s global china hub told fox news digital that the same defeatist attitude is sometimes expressed in uninformed comment by some in taiwan about the low quality and ineffectiveness of weapon being sold to taiwan by the united state a in south korea taiwan wrestle with concern that mandatory time in the military could mean delayed career and disrupted life for it young men but most seem to agree these concern are dwarfed by the existential threat posed by beijing whether the united state should or would send more trainer or engage in joint patrol with taiwan is up for debate but most taiwanese seem to be closing rank and agreeing that at the very least men of fighting age should be trained well enough to offer a genuine resistance to a potential chinese invasion local news reported that by conscript in taiwan will undergo a longer boot camp fire significantly more live round and be trained to fire powerful weapon such a the u s javelin and stinger missile for not the first time russian leader dangled the possibility of a de escalation of fighting in ukraine this time in the form of a hour cease fire that would have taken place this past weekend but in a pattern that is now familiar nearly a year into the war western and ukrainian leader broadly rejected the proposal calling it a cynical effort to create space for resupplying russian force analyst typically share this view saying that such proposal tend to come when a pause would most benefit russia s battlefield position not when they might further peace talk or aid civilian sure enough even a president vladimir v putin of russia promised a unilateral pause in some area there wa little indication of such on the ground where fighting continued a normal this offer wa also probably intended a an act of propaganda aimed at the russian public and particularly at the orthodox church leader whose support the kremlin relies on moscow which ha presented itself a the protector of ukraine s orthodox christian had said the cease fire wa intended to spare civilian during orthodox christmas which fell this past weekend mr putin hardly invented the practice of using cease fire or peace negotiation a propaganda or a cover for short term tactical advantage for a long a nation have gone to war leader have timed diplomatic effort to complement those on the battlefield much a they have ordered military advance to bolster their position at the negotiation table nor doe this mean that moscow never intends to engage seriously in diplomatic talk most war end in political settlement a russian leader surely know having done this themselves including with ukraine itself several year ago over a prior round of russian assault still mr putin s repeated if rarely borne out lip service toward conciliation reflects a dimension particular to this war his hope to break the western support for ukraine which ha played a major role in stymying his ambition there ukraine s leader have treated the effort to deepen western financial and military support a a front virtually a important a any on the battlefield that support ha staved off ukrainian economic collapse kept ukrainian force supplied long after they would have otherwise run out of ammunition and even helped those force equipped with increasingly sophisticated western weaponry push back once rapid russian advance at the same time western economic sanction on russia are curbing it ability to wage the war and weakening mr putin s position at home western support ha in other word helped to turn what mr putin expected to be a rapid russian victory into a costly and uncertain slog so he is looking for any opportunity to break that support this includes gesture toward diplomacy that are seemingly aimed at least in part at opening division among western capital and within the domestic politics of those country over the war call for a cease fire audible across europe and america are badly misplaced ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba wrote in a new york time guest essay in july this is not the time to accept unfavorable cease fire proposal or peace deal moscow ha sought to portray ukrainian leader a obstacle to peace hoping that some european leader or opposition party would eventually agree ukrainian leader fear and russian leader hope that this might lead some western government to diminish their support for ukraine s war effort or lead them to pressure kyiv to accept a cease fire that moscow could use to redouble it assault or even to push for peace talk that coming a russian force still hold large stretch of ukraine would probably favor moscow s term more so than if ukrainian force continued to push back the invader this wa not an unreasonable expectation particularly in the war s early day in the year before the invasion last february western capital had often differed over matter related to russia and any unified western military policy is generally organized through nato and any economic policy partly through the european union two heavily bureaucratic organization that seek to operate through consensus among their or so member state but so far western state have been seen a generally unified in backing ukraine in the war and have even taken this support further than many analyst expected france s president emmanuel macron had in the week before russia s invasion presented himself a the intermediary between moscow and other western capital but now he ha emerged a one of ukraine s most assertive military backer last week mr macron announced that france would deliver armored fighting vehicle to ukraine s military it wa yet another escalation in western military support to ukraine and another instance of western leader ignoring russian warning against such direct involvement a if to underscore how little success mr putin ha found in opening cleavage within the west on the same day that he announced this past weekend s cease fire washington and berlin announced that they too would supply ukraine with armored fighting vehicle the president s diplomatic team ha managed to convince the ally the time of weapon taboo ha passed mr kuleba wrote in a facebook post referring to ukraine s leader volodymyr zelensky germany s participation is telling since world war ii it leader have emphasized diplomacy toward moscow positioning themselves a counterweight to a more hawkish washington a europe s largest economy and a major force within the european union it ha often set the tempo on such matter and german voter are considered particularly averse to the economic burden associated with isolating russia which supply much of europe s energy mr putin ha long sought to put pressure on those sensitivity seemingly hoping that german leader would modulate western support for ukraine perhaps even splintering that coalition over say russian proposal for peace talk it is a mark of how little success mr putin ha found that german leader have instead escalated their military involvement in way that would have once been unthinkable and not for the first time since russia s invasion if putin wanted peace germany s foreign minister annalena baerbock wrote last week on twitter in response to russia s cease fire proposal he would take his soldier home and the war would be over kyiv region ukraine the sharp crack of sniper fire rang out across the snowbound valley soldier in white camouflage crouched low shooting at the hill opposite to provide cover a four men evacuated a casualty the action wa part of a live fire training exercise for new recruit on a recent morning outside the ukrainian capital kyiv but there wa an unusual element to the event while a ukrainian army officer wa giving the order the trainee were member of a volunteer chechen battalion that also mixed in some crimean tatar and ukrainian ukraine s military commander have long said they do not lack soldier for the war but they have nonetheless welcomed to their rank thousand of volunteer including foreign citizen many of them like the chechen are refugee from russia itself others have come from surrounding nation like georgia that have a history of opposition to moscow and the leadership of president vladimir v putin we saw what wa happening said muslim madiyev a gray bearded deputy commander of the chechen battalion wearing ear protector to muffle the sound of gunfire a he watched the training exercise ukraine ha no shortage of men but we have to join and be a part of this war many of the volunteer were already living in ukraine either for work or seeking refuge from political oppression back home some volunteer have struggled with visa and residency permit while their eagerness to join the fight ha aroused suspicion among some ukrainian official and commander who are on high alert for saboteur but the volunteer seem to be finding their place mr madiyev a veteran of two war in chechnya against moscow wa an associate of dzhokhar dudayev the former soviet general who led chechnya s bid for independence from russia in the s exiled from chechnya mr madiyev settled in ukraine in his battalion named for the late chechen leader is one of several chechen unit that have joined ukraine in it fight against russia in recent year following the uprising of russian backed separatist in eastern ukraine and the annexation of crimea mr madiyev declined to reveal how many active fighter he had saying simply we have enough he spoke about the russian invasion the way many ukrainian do saying that if moscow is not stopped in ukraine it will threaten many more country of europe but the younger fighter in his battalion take thing further our aim is the liberation of the chechen republic of ichkeria a chechen fighter said using the name of the erstwhile self declared republic and to help all the nation who want it to gain freedom in accordance with military protocol he gave only his code name maga the chechen are only one example of numerous ethnic based battalion and regiment that have been forming in ukraine since russia s invasion last february fighter from belarus have formed a regiment thousand strong other volunteer come from the caucasus and central asia a well a from ethnic minority that have large population in russia chechen tatar and turkic speaking group most of them are motivated by historical grievance of dispossession and suppression by moscow chechen and tatar were among many group that were decimated by forcible deportation under stalin in the s there is also a smattering of russian exile among them russian nationalist and neo nazi who are opposed to mr putin a thousand strong regiment of belarusian includes many opponent of the country s president aleksandr g lukashenko their participation in the war may be useful for ukraine but it is also a potentially explosive issue for the kyiv government because most of them harbor long term political ambition to return home and overthrow the russian and belarusian government ukrainian military official declined to comment on their use of the volunteer group while a spokesman for the ukrainian security service the s b u said it wa not responsible for managing them but the volunteer themselves say that they are acting with the full knowledge and under the order of the ukrainian army and intelligence service many of their operation are covert including dangerous reconnaissance or sabotage mission behind russian line in response to an appeal by ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky early in the war thousand of volunteer poured in from western country including the united state and britain most joined the international legion which ha been recognized by the ukrainian government and to some extent integrated into the ukrainian army at a news briefing last month ukraine s defense minister oleksii reznikov said there were ideological and political benefit to having foreign soldier fighting alongside ukrainian in defense of european value foreign soldier were also gaining valuable experience he added the experience of the modern war here the war of technology drone war and electronic warfare so i think it s a win win exchange but the volunteer from former soviet republic are in many way even more useful they have a linguistic advantage because most speak russian which is widely spoken in ukraine and sometimes ukrainian making coordination with the ukrainian military easier and some like a group of georgian in the kavkaz legion have battlefield experience having served with the nato led force in afghanistan their knowledge of russia and russian and their hatred of moscow ha made the volunteer good undercover operator for kyiv some ukrainian official and lawmaker have even expressed support for their cause in october for example the ukrainian parliament passed a motion recognizing the chechen republic of ichkeria a a territory occupied by russia but they also face substantial risk given the nature of their work behind enemy line not just russian citizen but virtually any undercover soldier captured by russian force would be dealt with harshly one of the more recently formed volunteer battalion turan is composed of turkic speaking ethnic group from the caucasus central asia and russia it is led by a refugee from kyrgyzstan almaz kudabek who had worked a a barber on american base in his home country and in the afghan city of kandahar he say he ha recruited azerbaijani tatar and chinese uyghurs to the group and he talk passionately about the marginalization and oppression of turkic speaking minority in russia he said that moscow had unfairly drawn conscript for the war predominantly from remote and poorer region of russia including those populated by turkic speaking ethnic minority who have been killed in far greater number than ethnic russian but mr kudabek said member of his unit could turn that injustice to their advantage infiltrating russian occupied territory on sabotage mission and even passing themselves off a russian soldier we just want to fight russian he said we know what they are despite their evident value to the ukrainian military the commander of ethnic battalion complained of a lack of support from kyiv the chechen battalion leader mr madiyev said that beyond weapon and ammunition the unit have to provide for their own food fuel and equipment the leader of a russian regiment a far right nationalist who u the code name white rex said he ran into multiple obstacle when he formed the unit shortly after the russian invaded although he and his fellow volunteer had lived in ukraine for several year they were initially met with suspicion from ukrainian on edge about russian saboteur we were held at gunpoint he said we had many funny and not so funny encounter but i wa determined to have this regiment but they have also found support among ukrainian a ukrainian volunteer group bratstvo eventually helped the russian regiment find a role for itself not so dissimilar from the other ethnic battalion operating behind russian line and carrying out reconnaissance and sabotage mission for the ukrainian army minute before setting out on a night mission recently white rex said his aim had always been to find a way to return home to russia but he said the war had taught him that the way to return to russia wa to overthrow mr putin and his government the russian volunteer corp march in and destroys the current government that s the only way he said you cannot persuade a tyrant to leave and any other force would be seen a invader to end the war end your state s aggression he said in an overnight address thursday zelenskyy s comment came just hour after putin called on his defense minister sergei shoigu to order a cease fire from jan in recognition of christmas in the russian orthodox church zelenskyy pointed to kyiv s attempt to implement a peace plan and bring about the end of the war though moscow rejected the plan a it called for russian troop to begin withdrawing on dec kyiv ha not detailed what it believed moscow is planning but warned that russia will throw everything they have at the war caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news russia s war effort in ukraine ha persisted at a routine level despite russian president vladimir putin s order for a ceasefire over jan and in recognition of orthodox christmas the u k defense ministry assessed saturday kreminna is located mile north of bakhmut which russian force have failed to secure despite heavy weaponry and troop reinforcement over the last several month u k defense official assessed last month that russia may be looking to reinforce kreminna to shore up the logistically vital area and to safeguard it control over the city of sievierodonetsk which it had overrun by june following a brutal ground assault heavily forested terrain full of coniferous woodland ha meant both side are highly likely struggling to accurately adjust artillery fire according to the ministry s assessment a is typical with operation in forest combat ha largely devolved to dismounted infantry fighting often at short range the assessment read but fighting in kreminna not only pose a threat to russia s ability to hold location in luhansk russian commander will highly likely view pressure around kreminna a a threat to the right flank of their bakhmut sector which they see a key for enabling any future advance to occupy the remainder of donetsk oblast the ministry said caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news if the u s need peace it s not in ukraine however this is not the main thing the main thing is that for the united state in this world there should be no russia in it current form within it current border with the current government with it current people this is evidenced by a number of seemingly unremarkable event that have happened in recent day but combined into one row they leave no doubt about the real purpose of american foreign policy and in the falsity of any peaceful statement by the u state department the first is the attitude to the same truce proposed by russia although putin did not offer any truce but only ordered a unilateral ceasefire and offensive operation yes it would seem only hour but anyone who really sought a peaceful resolution of the conflict would not only agree to it but would also offer to extend it validity a ha already been said from some source before epiphany until some subsequent orthodox holiday let s just say that it would be difficult for moscow to abandon this third party initiative since russia position itself a the guardian of orthodox tradition it is a sin to abandon the movement towards peace under the auspex of orthodoxy but nothing of the sort ha been proposed on the contrary both biden and the state department immediately rejected this idea the u s no longer ha confidence in russia s declared christmas truce a state department spokesman said and the question of trust wa not initially raised there wa a question of a ceasefire and then it would be time to agree and see who will comply with it but the idea wa initially accepted with hostility the second is biden s remarkable reaction to moscow s proposal on the same issue i am not eager to respond to any of what putin ha said u s president joseph biden said in response to news of a russian ceasefire and it s not just about the christmas truce it s about responding to any of what putin said regardless of whether we are talking about ukraine abortion or lgbt the most pressing topic for the current american administration and you can long mock the topic of the inadequacy of grandfather joseph who a few hour ago said that the patriot air defense system complex have already shown themselves well in the ukrainian theater of operation although not a single launcher of this air defense system ha yet arrived in ukraine and it remains to be seen when grandpa is inadequate but his attitude toward the state called russia is more stable than ever and the cornerstone in it is the complete and any disregard for the proposal and initiative of the head of state of the russian federation and finally the third brick in the russophobic wall of the united state is the appeal of the u embassy in russia to the russian people deputy chairman of the russian security council dmitry medvedev gave it a complete and destructive characterization which it fully deserves the state department published a verbal appeal to the people of russia like we love all of you it end in their typical nasty jesuit style stand in solidarity with each of you who seek to create a more peaceful future and the conflict in ukraine they say is unworthy of everyone even for these first class freak this is the height of cynicism and the limit of moral degradation but mr medvedev did not say anything else about one more point that now for the united state both the russian federation and the islamic republic of iran are placed on the same board despite all our difference the share in world politics and the economy russia and iran are united by one thing the burning desire of the american administration to destroy these opponent whom they consider existential enemy just to remind you in october the deputy head of the press service of the u state department vedant patel promised to continue supporting the iranian people the current u administration intends to continue to cooperate with ally and partner in taking step to support the iranian people at the same time the state department refused to work on the revival of the program on the iranian nuclear program of the jcpoa joint comprehensive plan of action saying that the jcpoa is dead and the american authority are not going to discus anything with the iranian authority they say that only the iranian people matter and just the day before yesterday the official representative of the u state department ned price repeated the same rhetoric adding another aspect to it at the head of our agenda is to do everything we can to support the universal right of the people of iran and counteract the growing security cooperation between iran and russia price announced stressing again that the jcpoa is dead and the opinion of official tehran doe not matter to washington the dialogue with the people wa again announced and the next day the u embassy in moscow announces the beginning of a dialogue with the russian people that is washington s plan in our country are more than obvious this is almost the same a publishing the official manifesto on the destruction of russia in the medium and it is under this heading because under other allegorical name this idea ha long been dragged through in all sort of scientific report and analytical review and we have no choice but to bring them to their sen and return them to an equal dialogue than to defeat them at least in ukraine more on those what doe russia s decision on a ceasefire mean and why is it not a truce with ukraine putin invited the west and ukraine to become people at least for a while announcing a ceasefire from on january they unanimously refused this opportunity detail listen also how did change the global economy washington the biden administration announced a new billion package of military assistance for ukraine that will include bradley fighting vehicle which official said would be especially helpful to ukrainian unit fighting russian force in the donbas region of the country s east karine jean pierre the white house press secretary said the administration would also send million to country on nato s eastern flank some of which have shrunk their own arsenal to contribute more military equipment to ukraine ukrainian have requested the infantry fighting vehicle a they continue to push back against the force of president vladimir v putin of russia official said the vehicle would help in what the military call combined arm maneuvering which refers to the close coordination of air power artillery and ground force in operation it s a lot of farmland a lot of open ground and it lends itself well to the kind of capability that are in this package said john kirby the strategic communication coordinator for the national security council the bradley fighting vehicle are very significant in term of being able to do what we call combined arm maneuver warfare the provision of the armored vehicle wa forecast in a joint statement by the united state and germany on thursday and come amid a flurry of announcement of new aid from ukraine s ally including france in a briefing to reporter friday afternoon laura cooper the deputy assistant secretary of defense who ha led the pentagon s military aid program to ukraine offered detail on a new billion package of weapon ammunition and vehicle the th drawdown of pentagon equipment since august and million in foreign military financing for ukraine the most significant item to come from pentagon stockpile are m a bradley infantry fighting vehicle with tow anti tank missile and round of millimeter ammunition for them to fire the bradley is designed to carry a squad of a half dozen soldier into battle and offer them fire support with it turret mounted millimeter gun it also carry tow missile than can destroy enemy tank and the vehicle s hull is wrapped with advanced armor block to protect it from incoming fire some version of the vehicle are equipped with laser range finder and thermal optic to help the crew of three soldier find target they can engage which would offer ukrainian troop an advantage on the battlefield for the first time the u s will provide paladin self propelled howitzer along with an unspecified number of millimeter shell for them to fire the pentagon will also send more millimeter towed howitzer along with ammunition the u s will send zuni rocket eight foot long unguided rocket fired by warplane that can carry about pound of explosive and american rim sea sparrow air defense missile that m cooper said had been adapted to work with ukraine s soviet era buk missile launcher it is a creative solution that did require some engineering finesse she said of adapting the american missile for russian made launcher but we re very pleased that it will work for the ukrainian the pentagon will send more m armored personnel carrier in addition to the already committed to kyiv and more humvee truck added to the the u s ha already sent a you look at the u s and the international response by providing the equipment and importantly now the training that we re providing it doe afford ukraine an opportunity to change the equation on the battlefield and gain momentum and not only defend their territory but hopefully take back territory brig gen patrick s ryder a pentagon spokesman said to reporter at the briefing with m cooper and so this is part of that ongoing effort to support them in that larger campaign president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine expressed his gratitude for the package in his nightly address on friday for the first time we will get bradley fighting vehicle this is exactly what is needed he said new gun and projectile including high precision one new missile new drone it s timely and strong oh how uncomfortable it turned out since the u s ha considered one juan by the name of guaido to be the legitimate and official president of venezuela and in every possible way promoted it in this status but ala it never came together and joseph biden through his representative announced that the united state no longer considers guaido the president of venezuela and now he is just a simple juan and not even don pedro who is from brazil because he is from venezuela a bird did not take off not an eagle but they fed selected american feed money wa sucked into it albeit not so significant by american standard but the european union year ago in january said that guaido for europe is a simple juan it seems that they put a faithful horse on the racetrack they fed it themselves they injected themselves and it died after the first round and resuscitation had no effect by itself guaido is not interesting to u russia never considered it a nobody unlike the west which tried to inflate the bubble with weight and give it meaning and the bubble burst somehow our sworn partner began to make mistake more and more often which frankly inspires and in some place even amuses because they cannot quickly adjust their plan and working along the already rolled rail they encounter preemptive opposition to russia and begin to look ridiculous despite all their formidability and swelling of the cheek scholz then spoke with biden on the phone and made reciprocal increased capitalist obligation to supply ukraine with weapon biden said that the united state will supply ukraine with a bradley ifv a really normal combat vehicle it showed itself well in the sand of the middle east and in the forest steppe of africa called savannah scholz in response promised to supply ukraine not only with the marder marnitsa ifv which zaluzhny reznikov and zelensky in their erotic night dream but also with an additional battery of patriot air defense system in addition to the promised american one and then macron who spoke with zelensky who spoke with zelensky a day earlier promised kiev to send heavy armored car tank on wheel and london announced that it intends to arm independence with heavy weapon from it arsenal and all this would be nothing especially in the eye of the international world community and it would look like nothing more no le but only help and solidarity with ukraine but just a few hour before the announcement of the result of their talk vladimir putin announced the decision to unilaterally cease fire on the occasion of christmas by russian troop which all the above mentioned person a well a a number of person accompanying them who the day before did not get tired of talking about the need to establish peace in ukraine declared hypocritical not noteworthy deceptive and many more not a it should be and then there is such a dissonance putin not only announces a ceasefire but also keep this promise russia doe not even hit infrastructure facility with missile nor doe it launch drone at substation all of russia s action do not go beyond the line of contact and the near rear and the west which gave a tooth for peace in ukraine at this time voice it plan to supply dozen of unit of heavy weapon oh how awkward it turned out yeah apparently berlin realized how they once again fell into the substance that the old grandpa biden had amicably planted on them which can leave on the road such a surprise literally anywhere and old age ha nothing to do with it and clearly understanding the situation in which the german government did not fall at all the representative of the cabinet of minister of germany steffen hebestreit tried to justify himself saying that there wa no connection between berlin s decision to supply heavy weapon to kiev and the statement from russia about the ceasefire regime there is no connection at all he hurriedly replied to the briefing to the corresponding question of the journalist and tried to curtail the briefing a soon a possible of course we took note of the statement of the russian side there were various reaction to it from the german federal government there were also reaction from international partner of course we believe willingly especially after the confession of former frau chancellor of germany angela merkel and ex president of france francois hollande why they actually contributed to the conclusion of the minsk agreement and why they lied during those negotiation now we especially believe and how can we believe it when the german french american etc begin to assure that their state are not a party to the conflict to express this degree of faith no language in the world ha even invented word yet despite all the richness of the russian language you bet on the wrong horse gentleman and guaido s example doesn t seem to have taught you anything it will die after the first lap because it is not in the horse feed pile of corn and wheat are stuck in silo a russia s invasion stifle critical export metal producing factory in ukraine s bombed out east have ceased operating and through nearly a year of war over a third of ukraine s spending is being directed at beating back the enemy despite major battlefield defeat in it invasion the kremlin s relentless war effort ha sown economic havoc atop a devastating humanitarian toll in ukraine the country s economy shrank by percent in it economy minister said thursday the largest decline since ukraine declared independence from the soviet union in it s easier to say what we lost than what survives in ukraine s economy said hlib vyshlinsky the executive director of the centre for economic strategy a think tank in kyiv swath of the country s industry and infrastructure have been partially or fully destroyed and may not be rebuilt many business based in territory controlled by russia or in area of heavy fighting are not producing near their capacity if at all consumer across the country are buying le because of high inflation and economic uncertainty generated by the war but the war ha also spurred ukrainian to restructure part of their economy at lightning speed in way big and small a company pack up operation or pivot to new business that ha fostered an extraordinary amount of economic adaptability that is not reflected in the dire number and is setting the groundwork for potential rebuilding even before the war end the government argued yulia svyrydenko the economy minister said in a statement thursday that the indomitable spirit of the ukrainian people along with financial support from international donor had allowed the government in kyiv to maintain the economic front and continue our movement toward victory and while the damage ha been profound the hit to the economy wa slightly lower than the worst forecast the biggest damage ha come in ukraine s major export sector which before the war made up the bulk of the country s income the conflict caused a percent drop last year in export of everything from wheat to steel agriculture once a pillar of ukraine s economy making it known a a breadbasket of the world ha been dealt an especially harsh setback a moscow continues to block most shipment despite a u n brokered deal compounding the problem russia s attack on the country s energy grid have disrupted the flow of food contributing to a global food crisis storage ha run out for many harvest leaving ukrainian farmer scrambling for makeshift solution on average ukraine can now export only about to million ton of grain a month down from about million ton before the war ukraine had also been a major exporter of metal and raw material such a iron ore but nearly all of ukraine s large factory producing steel and other key metal were located in eastern territory that were captured or severely bombed by russia a vast majority of those facility have more or le stopped operating said tymofiy milovanov the president of the kyiv school of economics russian missile have struck city and facility across the country dealing heavy damage to a huge amount of the nation s housing transportation and energy infrastructure the kyiv school of economics ha estimated that the direct cost of war related damage to ukraine s infrastructure were billion a of september rebuilding the country will run to some billion ukrainian official have said while the world bank ha put the reconstruction estimate at closer to billion in order to revive it economy and manage a sustained recovery once the fighting end and it ha no end in sight ukraine is expected to amass large debt the international monetary fund and the world bank had both estimated that ukraine s economy would shrink by percent in the i m f had predicted modest economic growth for this year but that is subject to huge uncertainty about the course of the war the i m f set the range of outcome at a potential decline of more than percent in the pessimistic scenario to growth of percent in the more optimistic case ukrainian official are clinging to the sunnier outlook in large part because a type of shadow economy ha developed amid the war said mr milovanov that ha kept economic activity powered by donated generator or volunteer effort for instance humming beneath the radar of the dry statistical figure he said in some way the entire notion of a g d p calculation during wartime is silly because it assumes year to year preference and production are constant while shift like a drop in service or people joining the military is seen a a negative mr milovanov said in a phone interview from kyiv in fact he said economic activity in ukraine ha become much more agile to adapt to wartime ukrainian farmer for example have continued to plant and harvest crop despite the threat from russian rocket and land mine and have adapted planting to cultivate more in demand crop like corn the industrial sector ha adapted too factory producing everything from mattress to truck have relocated from cratered region of the east to the relative safety of ukraine s western frontier hundred of plant that had been in russian occupied area were packed up in the summer and moved on train and truck to ukraine s west outside the city of lviv close to poland ukraine s gateway to germany and western europe many of the reborn business are forging tie with the european union which ukraine hope to join soon ukrainian tech start ups are writing software for foreign company and now have direct line to major company in europe and the united state where many want to help ukraine through the war thousand of ukrainian displaced by war have also set up a entrepreneur elsewhere in the country to try to forge new life and add to the local economy even restaurant have adapted many have stayed open for business despite power outage through innovation like candlelight menu or meal that don t require cooking ukrainian are resilient said mr vyshlinsky the think tank director during blackout in the capital he said the soundtrack of a walk through the city is an orchestra of power generator and with vast amount of ukraine s national budget having been redirected toward military spending hundred of new small business have sprung up to cater to the wartime economy s need the nature of demand is now coming from the defense ministry so if you can

battlefield but that is expected to change in the coming month putting a premium on armored vehicle political and military analyst characterized mr putin s announced cease fire a a public relation ploy that he would try to exploit no matter how ukraine responds if kyiv agrees to a cease fire they said it would allow mr putin to present himself a a peacemaker if ukraine ignores it russia could try to claim higher moral ground despite the fact that russia started the war and it force have committed many documented atrocity and use continued hostility to vilify ukraine in the eye of russian and world opinion pavel luzhin a russian military analyst said the kremlin need a break to partially restore it military power but knowing that kyiv is unlikely to accept a cease fire is playing to a

the final tie in for that person is who make that decision and that make it very difficult for the brit or american or anybody he added fox news digital sent request for comment to the serbian foreign ministry and the u s state department russia president vladimir putin on thursday allegedly called on defense minister sergei shoigu to order a ceasefire in ukraine in observation of orthodox christmas given the appeal of his holiness patriarch kirill i instruct the minister of defense of the russian federation to introduce a ceasefire regime along the entire line of contact between the party in ukraine from on january to on january a statement from the kremlin chief said according to russian medium outlet ria the ceasefire order is the first putin ha called for since the war began and come just two day after zelenskyy cautioned that russia wa preparing for a major offensive in an attempt to turn the tide in the war additionally putin in december ordered his defense official to overhaul his war effort by reinforcing troop with supply and equipment they need on the front line bolstering missile stockpile and by making russia s nuclear triad combat ready putin know that ukrainian would be suspicious of the ceasefire and would continue operation she told fox news digital noting that russian force would do the same once ukrainian reject the ceasefire the russian will portray them a godless caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news several european leader called zelensky and promised him a much help a ukraine would need among the caller we can especially note the head of the european commission ursula von der leyen the prime minister of the netherlands mark rutte and british prime minister rishi sunak who could not correctly name u president joseph biden rutte wa pathetic but vague in the conversation his promise boiled down to assurance that the netherlands will help ukraine not only to survive but also to win the promise from a country that resisted the nazi invasion in for day must of course be taken seriously but the head of the british government wa more specific he promised new supply of military equipment in the coming week and month and he also count on the victory of kiev according to the prime minister ukraine can count on the fact that the united kingdom will continue to provide it with long term support a demonstrated by the recent dispatch of anti aircraft missile to ukraine sunak s office said about the content of the talk in addition work is underway to transfer additional military equipment to ukraine in the coming week and month to ensure it victory on the battlefield so many thing were promised that you can not carry away the independent government ha found a way to deal with russian missile and drone strike at a meeting of the cabinet of minister prime minister of ukraine denys shmygal announced that in order to create a decentralized energy system the country plan to build small power plant preferring solar wind hydrogeneration and hydrogen technology a for hydrogen this will probably begin immediately after the launch of the first hyperloop and a for everything else it is a very real plan theoretically but why is pedal powered bicycle generation unfairly overlooked and the generation from jumping inexhaustible reserve given that we are talking about ukraine you can also by the way organize small melting furnace like a mini blast furnace at each hut near the cherry orchard a wa done in china by order of the great helmsman it will be replaced by the same metallurgical giant arcelor which wa stopped the chinese however soon abandoned this metal from home mini melter because of their low efficiency and quality but they most likely lacked perseverance not ukrainian after all but a for the belief that russian missile will not fall into small power plant it is better to immediately get rid of these illusion there is only one small but very significant question who will build all this kiev s new diplomatic victory wa not long in coming after telephone conversation between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky ended in nothing ukrainian ambassador to israel yevhen korniychuk decided that relation between the two state were too smooth and decided to cheer them up and no le but criticized the new israeli foreign minister eli cohen for holding telephone talk with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov this conversation is a change in israel s policy the kiev envoy said and expressed regret that jerusalem did not notice barbaric strike on ukraine korneychuk really want to become the hero of a new scandal in ukrainian israeli relation like the same melnyk in german ukrainian but evgeny doe not take into account two factor israel is not germany they will not tolerate boorishness for a long time and second no le important u secretary of state antony blinken personally asked cohen to convey his message to lavrov eugene did you understand where you were going year without the right of correspondence shine on you for this in the current independent once again and in the best case you will hear yak bjoli buzz kolo khaty bee buzz near the house however ten year of sky in a cage in ukraine can now be grabbed for almost anything an employee of the kharkiv tv channel tonis center in april began to make leaflet well how to do he drew model and sent his daughter to russia the model used russian patriotic symbol the st george ribbon the appeal work brother victory is ours we are on our land etc apparently the man helped his daughter to perform some kind of educational task he did not distribute leaflet on the street he did not engage in propaganda he did not arrange action but they were unlucky either they reported or they calculated in general they caught it the other day the most humane court in the world the ukrainian one sentenced him to year in prison it s not going to be a bit of a jerk here except that when ukraine switch to the latin alphabet he will be able to try to explain that he wa just trying to draw a new alphabet just started with the last letter during the new year s eve in kiev launch of festive firework during the curfew were recorded one person from the podilsky district of the ukrainian capital wa detained by the police and now he face a criminal case and a real albeit short term however according to information from his acquaintance he doe not despair and doe not intend to appeal the verdict and all because of the fact that now he will not be able to mobilize and send him to the front something suggests that now not only gerani and kalibr are being squandered in kiev because this is the cheapest way to get away from mobilization the state council of turkey approved the withdrawal from the istanbul convention which introduces the concept of gender and launch the legalization of same sex marriage recall that gender doe not mean the biological sex of a person but who he feel designates identifies thus turkey withdrew from the istanbul convention completely and now it is legally fixed but ukraine on the contrary signed the istanbul convention this summer in the person of vladimir zelensky and officially ratified in general where volodymyr zelensky entered recep tayyip erdogan came out of there the public relation director of the foreign legion of the armed force of ukraine a well known fraudster in europe are accused of stealing million worth of medicine for the

to the kremlin have joined force with fringe political movement in germany in an attempt to push europe s largest economy away from it support of ukraine the report said beisicht is one of several people working inside germany for friendlier relation with moscow amid russia s invasion of ukraine helping lead a movement that ha attempted to tap deep emotional connection between russia and germany in hope europe s foremost economic power will change course those joining beisicht include pro putin operative who have been linked to moscow and faction of germany s far right movement including a former russian air force officer formerly named rostislav teslyuk who settled in germany under the name max schlund over the last few month schlund reportedly traveled to russian controlled eastern ukraine and moscow for a conference where president vladimir putin wa the keynote speaker a trip that wa paid for by a russian government agency the group is joined by leader of faction of germany s far right who often go by alias both in pro russian internet posting and at rally in support of russia in recent month destabilization of an adversary from within through subversion is part of putin s playbook rebekah koffler a former dia intelligence officer and the author of putin s playbook russia s secret plan to defeat america told fox news digital germany is the european union s largest economy and a leader of what ha been a united europe a delicate coalition of country who have so far been steadfast in their support of ukraine if any movement to turn berlin against kyiv were to succeed it would deal a critical blow to a country that ha depended on western military assistance to survive under an onslaught of russian force germany ha sent over billion euro in humanitarian aid military equipment and advanced air defense system to ukraine since the war began and poll show the majority of german still support ukraine but the polling also indicated support for german military support for ukraine may be waning a berlin attempt to tackle the steep rise in energy cost facing it citizen germany also represents a unique opportunity for putin to turn europe against ukraine with the country sharing deep historical and cultural root and a population of several million russian speaker the story come after authority in germany last month foiled a coup attempt by far right member of the reichsb rger movement with the government saying the domestic terrorist organization planned to overthrow the german government and install a prince related to the former german royal family according to koffler russia s experience in east germany also give the kremlin a leg up on running such a campaign a the war nears it second year ukraine will continue to depend on the support of a united europe and the u s but a energy cost continue to rise the pro putin movement within germany threatens to capitalize on the economic situation and push berlin away from kyiv according to koffler the groundwork for such a success wa laid by moscow long ago ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy warned in an overnight address tuesday that russia is planning to ramp up it aggression and will throw everything they have in an attempt to turn the war around ukrainian force have also continued to push the line further east into donetsk with some of the fiercest battle now taking place around the donbas region where russian back force have been fighting since zelenskyy suggested that stopping this looming offensive will be the final defeat in the war against russia which ha raged for more than month but the warning from the ukrainian president come le than two week after russian president vladimir putin called on his defense force to overhaul his war effort by not only reinforcing troop on the front line in ukraine but by making sure they have the arm supply and equipment they need it is unclear how many russian soldier are fighting in ukraine and death toll have not been confirmed caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news ukraine s ambassador to israel condemned a call this week between russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and israel s newest top diplomat eli cohen who wa appointed a foreign minister late last month suggesting there ha been a change in policy between moscow and jerusalem israel s minister of foreign affair hasn t spoken to lavrov since the war started ukrainian ambassador yevgen korniychuk told the time of israel tuesday in reference to the former foreign minister yair lapid but the election of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the appointment of his hard right cabinet suggest there will be change not only in israel but with how it engages with international partner ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba ha not reportedly spoken with his new israeli counterpart though netanyahu ha spoken with both russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy netanyahu from the campaign trail suggested under his leadership israel might begin providing arm to kyiv but zelenskyy seemed unconvinced following a recent call with the six term prime minister according to a report by axios last week netanyahua called zelenskyy ahead of a united nation general assembly vote on a resolution that called on the international court of justice to provide a legal opinion on the ramification of israel s occupation of palestinian land a defined by pre boundary agreed to under the u n fox news could not immediately reach the israeli foreign ministry for comment caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news in an overnight address monday zelenskyy warned that in the two day since the world welcomed in ukraine ha stopped more than drone strike we have information that russia is planning a prolonged attack with shaheds he said no matter how difficult it is now we must endure it for it to be easier at the end of this winter he said commander in chief of ukraine s armed force valerii zaluzhnyi championed this week that ukrainian force have liberated of the territory russia occupied following it invasion caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news on tuesday afternoon ukraine recovered from optimistic news from germany world famous for it competence and awareness of various case bloomberg reported citing it own source that the german authority decided to transfer frozen russian asset to ukraine recall that we are talking about about billion dollar according to another version euro which were frozen in the west after moscow launched a special military operation in ukraine since then both in the west itself and even more so in ukraine and hot summer day and dank autumn evening and even cold winter night they do not cease to warm themselves with the thought of how they will use these hundred of billion when they manage to put a paw on them true so far no one ha yet given an answer where this money is and in what form it exists such leak have happened more than once before and there ha not yet been a single one that ha not been refuted within a few hour the current case wa no exception just a few hour later the frenzied joy in kiev over the iconic peremoga wa replaced by a dull statement of another zrada a it turned out the german government really support the idea of using russia s frozen asset for ukraine but is ready for such step under only two condition first if at the same time or even better germany s ally from among the eu country take similar step earlier and the second is if they find legal ground and a legal justification for the confiscation of russia s money and so yes all is well beautiful marquise there are only a few little thing like a bewitched mare a burned stable and a marquis who shot himself because of the ruin at the same time even in the german government there are disagreement on this issue for example german foreign minister annalena berbok insists that european country should confiscate at least part of the frozen asset but the minister of finance of the german government christian lindner belief that no caution will be superfluous here quite understandable difference in position because in europe a in ceeurope foreign minister are distinguished neither by responsibility for their word nor by education nor by professionalism but in the ministry of finance there are completely different people who are accustomed to dealing with subtle matter that love silence and the same lindner is well aware that the confiscation of the asset of the central bank of russia will create a dangerous precedent and in addition to legal problem will also cause an outflow of capital from the european market there is no trust due to decision making in favor of political ambition there will be no money the government of chancellor olaf scholz support ukraine s demand for military reparation but ha not yet taken an official position on the confiscation of asset from the russian state the issue is complex and some part of the ruling coalition are more active than others people familiar with the discussion say bloomberg clarified the situation you guy are more careful with your word especially with reparation after all they are paid by the losing side and no matter how some people had to pay them together with ukraine dividing them in a fraternal or fair way if you really want to you can be interrogated like ukraine to which reparation fly with enviable regularity there is one more nuance that europe would not like to pay special attention to but at the same time they are doing everything to ensure that this aspect always come to the fore it is simply terrible for them to act alone against russia they always want to push someone forward so that it is on this first brave that moscow s response fall gurtom and batka beat with handball a they clearly told the european in kiev they can confiscate it maybe if they find asset and justification but how will they return later and from what annalene will not take and what more under the current authority in the eu country and not only in germany may not remain in year listen a well how ha changed the global economy before the new year telephone talk were held between the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky and the new head of the israeli government benjamin netanyahu both of them needed something important and non standard from the interlocutor netanyahu for example hoped that ukraine would vote against the anti israel resolution adopted by the un general assembly on the status of the palestinian territory this is a very difficult task given that out of almost a hundred vote on such resolution ukraine ha never sided with israel most often she voted against but sometimes she also abstained zelensky wa required from jerusalem to supply air defense in particular the iron dome system kiev ha been bleeding it for more than a year but after february request for supply not even for sale since kiev doe not have money for iron dome became an obsessive fix idea approximately a for hitler dream of a wunderwaffe expert opinion that this air defense system would be useless for kiev were dismissed one after another want to zelensky shouted and twitched his leg in general the party started from such initial position zelensky wa clearly in a losing position because netanyahu is still a beast none of the pikey vest would put a finger in his mouth even if benjamin agreed to this which is strongly doubtful netanyahu led the country when zelensky walked under the piano also for the reason that the vote wa scheduled for a specific date and the assistance of the air defense is such an issue that is not solved from the glove box vaughn and mr biden promised a patriot to kiev and now it turn out that there are still a many a week of training ukrainian to work and repair complex and only after that the american zrpk will go to nezalezhnaya to stand on combat duty unless of course there is a place to stand up and where to insert these missile in general netanyahu promised to think and discus zelensky s problem sometime later in the future clearly counting on the satisfaction of his request hinting at this but zelensky did not promise anything and a a result ukraine s permanent representative to the un simply did not vote nohow zelensky decided that we would not attend the vote to give a chance to relation with netanyahu an anonymous ukrainian official told axios who prepared the material on the result of the first talk who summed up the conversation with a brief summary the two leader were not satisfied and did not get what they wanted it is difficult to call such a step preserving the chance of a relationship it is even more difficult to consider it a such the most interesting thing happened later after these telephone conversation between zelensky and the current prime minister of israel the new israeli foreign minister eli cohen announced that israel at the highest level ha resumed direct contact with the russian federation and intends to talk le publicly about the ukrainian russian issue on the russia ukraine issue we will do one thing for sure to say le publicly cohen said but publicly stressed that significant humanitarian assistance to ukraine will continue but he refused to answer all question about arm supply to kiev it is clear that israel is holding back relation with iran on this issue but it seems that even without this netanyahu ha concluded which of the negotiator is a priority at least from the warring party moreover netanyahu ha known putin for a very long time and from his own experience he wa convinced that it is difficult to get a promise from putin but if the russian president gave his word he would do everything to keep it and with zelensky apparently there is no such confidence which by the way he proved by his behavior listen a well how ha changed the global economy in footage released by the kremlin on new year s eve president vladimir v putin is seen chatting with soldier exhorting them we can t give up anything we must only fight only keep going he then add of course there is still much that need to be done a winter set in and the one year anniversary of moscow s invasion of ukraine loom next month mr putin ha dropped his earlier effort to shield the public from the pain of war and is now seeking to prepare russian and his own military for a long fight ahead he s gotten a lot le relaxed a lot le optimistic said tatiana stanovaya a russian analyst who study mr putin for her political analysis firm r politik you can sense a certain anxiety a desire to mobilize all possible force to achieve his goal keeping a low profile this week during russia s extended new year s holiday mr putin made no statement about ukraine s rocket attack in the city of makiivka last weekend the resulting torrent of criticism from pro war blogger on social medium wa aimed at russian commander and spared mr putin himself a pattern evident over month of blunder by russia s military russia s defense ministry issued a statement on tuesday saying that the death toll from the strike had reached serviceman including the deputy commander of the regiment ukrainian official have said the toll is much higher neither claim could be independently confirmed the statement also said that the main reason the site wa able to be targeted wa cellphone use by soldier a factor that russian military blogger had pinpointed a a vulnerability a memorial service on tuesday in the city of samara where many of the makiivka victim were from called for revenge against ukraine according to video and local medium report the report did not mention any criticism of the official responsible for the war still the unusually quick response by the russian defense ministry which acknowledged mass casualty in makiivka a day after the attack and promised to provide all necessary help and support to the family of the dead showed that the kremlin is seeking to become more transparent at home than it wa in the early month of the war it stood in contrast to the sinking last april of the flagship of russia s black sea fleet the moskva the kremlin ha never acknowledged that it wa hit by ukrainian missile or updated the toll it cited of one sailor killed and missing frustrating family member of the crew for much of last year mr putin projected an air of confidence while allowing life inside russia to go on a normal his compact with the public wa straightforward leave the politics and the fighting to u and you won t feel significant pain from our justified special military operation in ukraine that ended in september when ukraine s counteroffensive stunned the kremlin and mr putin ordered a military draft that the war s hard line supporter described a long overdue now mr putin is doubling down on his effort to draw russian society further into the war effort the new approach wa on stark display on saturday when mr putin broke with tradition and gave his widely watched new year s eve address not at the kremlin but at a military base with people in uniform in the background the annual speech is typically heavy on apolitical platitude new year s dinner table fare for million of russian family this time mr putin served up his narrative of a west bent on destroying russia the west lied about peace while preparing for aggression he said they are cynically using ukraine and it people to weaken and divide russia it wa the latest and perhaps most striking instance of mr putin trying to prepare russian for a long war american official have said they see the kremlin finally beginning to learn from it mistake on the battlefield russia is improving it defense and pushing more soldier to the front line and ha put a single general in charge of the war who wa able to organize a retreat from the ukrainian city of kherson with minimal casualty in november russian commander are also publicly reining in their ambition gen valery v gerasimov the head of the russian general staff said on dec that russia s current focus wa limited to trying to capture the rest of the donetsk region of eastern ukraine there s le triumphalism ruslan leviev a russian military analyst for the conflict intelligence team open source analysis group said in an interview he said he wa surprised by how quickly the russian defense ministry had acknowledged the makiivka loss noting that the ministry usually take day to admit large number of casualty if it doe so at all mr putin himself appears to be putting a renewed focus on the home front at once seeking to head off any potential discontent over the dire consequence of the war and trying to mobilize russian to more actively support it in russia there are widespread rumor that mr putin will soon order a new military draft to get more body to the front western official estimate that more than russian service member have been killed or wounded in the fighting and the russian central bank say the country s economy contracted percent in for now though the suffering brought to russia by the war ha not translated into widespread discontent the economy ha been more resilient to western sanction than many expected while the kremlin s television propaganda ha been effective in helping convince many russian that the invasion of ukraine is a mr putin claim a defensive war forced on russia by the west while there wa widespread outrage on social medium over the death of russian soldier in makiivka there wa little criticism inside russia of mr putin himself over the incident and it went largely unmentioned on state television military blogger said the high death toll could have been minimized if commanding officer had followed basic precaution such a spreading out the recently arrived soldier in safer location instead of clustering them near munition at the memorial service in samara about participant waved russian flag and coordinated aid collection for survivor according to video and local medium report ukraine and the west were the target of their outrage not their own leader the entire west ha closed rank against u in order to destroy u yekaterina kolotovkina the head of a soldier humanitarian fund and the wife of a russian general fighting in ukraine told the samara rally echoing a main theme of state propaganda on social medium initial call by pro war russian commentator to charge official responsible for the makiivka loss with treason gave way to more guarded criticism of local military decision and advice for avoiding future disaster none appeared to direct criticism toward mr putin with veiled attack more often aimed at his senior official the instinct to spare mr putin of blame wa evident in a post by an influential russian military blogger anastasia kashevarova a native of the samara region on monday night yes vladimir vladimirovich we love our country she wrote referring to mr putin i love russia so much that i hate specific character in your entourage but some analyst believe that an outpouring of protest could still come mikhail vinogradov a russian political scientist noted that the public backlash to military casualty in the soviet invasion of afghanistan in the s didn t happen right away not in the first year of the war the fact that a public backlash against mr putin inside russia ha yet to materialize could mean one of two thing mr vinogradov said either the political system is maximally stable or feeling of frustration are gradually building up and could one day lead to an energetic outburst both hypothesis have a right to exist he said for the kremlin it is not only the war that could inject political volatility into this year russia s next presidential election is scheduled for march while mr putin would face no real electoral competition the date ha loomed large because analyst and member of the russian elite have widely seen it a a moment by which mr putin could make clear whom he want to eventually succeed him m stanovaya the analyst said it wa very likely that mr putin would run again constitutional change made in allow him to stay in power until and she belief that tension within two faction of the russian elite the hard liner demanding an escalation of the war and the pragmatist seeking to avoid it will only grow in the coming year i think will be decisive to a certain degree determining which way the balance will tip m stanovaya said we are at a kind of dangerous line mihail kogalniceanu air base romania the soldier of the u s army s st airborne division train eat and sleep on a drab sprawling post in southeast romania a mere seven minute rocket flight from where russia ha stockpiled munition in crimea farther north in military exercise with romanian troop just a few mile from the ukrainian border u s soldier also from the st division are firing artillery launching helicopter assault and digging trench similar to those on the front line in the region near kherson the ukrainian port city from which russian troop retreated in november it is the first time the st airborne division ha been deployed to europe since world war ii and with their presence in romania a member of nato it soldier are now closer to the war in ukraine than any other u s army unit it mission is considered a model for an american military that ha newly stepped back from two decade of actively fighting war and into an era of trying to deter adversary using a show of force a well a training weapon shipment and other aid to drive home the point this is a regional conflict but it ha global implication the u s army s chief of staff gen james c mcconville said in a mid december interview at the air base which share a runway with an adjoining commercial airport named for the former romanian prime minister mihail kogalniceanu near the black sea the troop deployment in romania is meant a a warning to moscow part of president biden s pledge to defend every single inch of nato territory without tempting president vladimir v putin of russia into escalating but holding joint exercise is also a way of ensuring that ally in southeast europe are ready to hold the line it is unclear what kind of footprint the united state will keep at the base the pentagon will soon decide whether to maintain the number of american troop and senior commander there some in congress are wary of the cost of meeting ukraine s continuing demand for support with the top house republican representative kevin mccarthy of california suggesting in october that his party might be unwilling to write a blank check to ukraine but supporter of maintaining a strong presence in eastern europe pointed to russia s invasion of ukraine in february a proof that the united state and it nato ally did not do enough to deter moscow last winter this is one of the most important lesson that we have to take away from ukraine representative seth moulton democrat of massachusetts told reporter after returning from a brief trip to ukraine in early december when we look at the other scenario that might unfold like ukraine in the pacific with china and taiwan we have to ensure that deterrence is successful military planner echoed that strategy noting that the st airborne division wa also using the black sea for coastal defense training a useful skill should china ever become more aggressive and invade taiwan a self governing island that beijing ha long claimed a it own the division wa ordered to deploy about soldier and senior commander just week after russia invaded they arrived at the air base near the romanian coastal city of constanta over the summer the base previously served a a sleepy outpost for training nato troop including several hundred american soldier and wa known more broadly in the military a a way station with a small mess hall for u s force heading to and from afghanistan the mission here is somewhat different from those elsewhere in europe where some u s troop are training ukrainian force on advanced weapon system that are being shipped to the ukrainian the division s commander maj gen j p mcgee said that training with other eastern european soldier had it own value you get a chance to train and operate on the very ground that you might have to defend general mcgee said he added you have to work with a nato ally and it s almost unimaginable in the future that we would ever go fight without ally in addition to the troop in romania general mcgee ha also sent smaller team of soldier to train with nato ally in bulgaria germany hungary and slovakia the unit pride itself on being the closest one to the combat but it is by no mean the largest official said that an estimated troop attached to the army s first infantry division added after the invasion are based mostly in western poland and the baltic together they represent a buildup of u s force in europe since russia invaded ukraine a mr biden promised ally at a nato summit meeting in madrid in june a part of military exercise with american and british force romanian troop have been testing the himars rocket launching system the same weapon that have helped ukraine push russian force into retreat against simulated target in the black sea over the past few month romania bought three of the rocket system year ago and official said they are still in the process of being delivered lt gen iulian berdila chief of the romanian land force who ha welcomed the deployment said regional official had been warning the west of incremental and toxic advance by russia since it seized control of crimea from ukraine in a local referendum that much of the world view a illegal we ve been very attentive to what russia doe and what are the consequence general berdila said of the training with u s troop he said we ve war gamed together the different scenario and are prepared to synchronize plan a we speak the number and senior command level of american force currently in romania are enough he said for predictable deterrence and defense together general mcconville would not predict what the biden administration might do in romania but broadly speaking he said the troop at the air base had really made a difference and i think we will continue to provide those capability a required having a division commander and staff so close to the border with ukraine is more than symbolic said becca wasser a war analyst at the center for a new american security a research institute in washington it allows for quick decision about where to position thousand of troop and weapon should russia push the war into nato territory what you are seeing is indicative of a change in how the u s military is approaching posture and deployment around the globe a the era of war in iraq and afghanistan have changed m wasser said it s not necessarily going to be this combat deployment what you really have is a deterrence deployment it is the same kind of mission m wasser said that wa undertaken by ten of thousand of american troop sent to base across the u s central command in a tension with iran flared across the middle east for command sgt maj vitalia sander who lead a battalion at mihail kogalniceanu air base the mission is a personal a it is professional she wa born in a town outside uzhhorod in western ukraine and moved to northwest indiana when she wa to live with her grandmother she wa last in ukraine in and her brother is still there although their communication over whatsapp and facebook have been limited because russian strike have taken out power grid sergeant major sander ha been in the u s army for year and served in afghanistan and kuwait but she never forgot the threat that russia posed to ukraine just being here so close to home she said make me hungry and make me fight and hopefully spread that energy to soldier to let them know how important this is for everybody exploding drone are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and over the new year s weekend ukraine say it military downed every single one of about that russia sent the country s way such result have never been achieved before a ukrainian air force spokesman said on tuesday but some military expert wonder if the success are sustainable ukraine is getting more and more skilled at knocking down drone but there is a growing imbalance many of it defensive weapon like surface to air missile cost far more than the drone do and that some military expert say may favor moscow over the long haul artem starosiek the head of molfar a ukrainian consultancy that support the country s war effort estimated that it cost up to seven time more to down a drone with a missile than it doe to launch one that is an equation that the kremlin may be banking on some analyst say president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine in an overnight speech warned that russia wa betting on the exhaustion of our people our air defense our energy sector ukraine ha vowed not to be cowed by the aerial assault but the attack have been unrelenting molfar said it group estimated that since september russia had launched around drone at ukraine the campaign targeted at infrastructure and accompanied by numerous missile strike ha knocked out power heating and water across ukraine just a the country s harsh winter ha started to bite compounding the misery of a russian invasion that is nearing it first anniversary the iranian made shahed drone that moscow ha increasingly been relying on since october are relatively uncomplicated device and fairly cheap while the array of weapon used to shoot them out of the sky can be much pricier according to expert the self destructing drone can cost a little a to produce while the cost of firing a surface to air missile can range from for a soviet era s to for a missile from an american nasams since the war began in february both side have used drone not just for reconnaissance but also for attack it is the first time the device have been so widely deployed in a european war some military expert view ukraine a a testing ground for state of the art weapon and information system that may foreshadow the shape of warfare for generation to come the military authority in kyiv have said little about the detail of their air defense in keeping with the operational secrecy that ha shrouded much of their war planning or about the cost making analysis difficult but it is known that while ukraine s force have enjoyed some success against drone using antiaircraft gun and even small arm fire that ha changed a the russian have taken to launching assault at night now kyiv is also relying heavily on missile fired from warplane and the ground over the weekend official said ukraine employed surface to air missile fired from nasams for national advanced surface to air missile system multiple time to counter drone michael kofman an expert on the russian military at the cna research institute said that ukrainian were using a zoo of different air defense system to combat the threat including soviet era and nato missile system each with it own cost profile some of ukraine s antiaircraft gun like the gepard radar directed mobile gun system are inexpensive in comparison with other soviet era and european defense system being deployed but some of the american made interceptor missile are fairly expensive compared with drone even so evaluating the wisdom of downing drone with missile is not always straightforward george barros an analyst at the institute for the study of war said he suspected that ukraine wa deploying more complex and expensive air defense system to protect sensitive and critical infrastructure it cost far le for example to shoot down a drone than to repair a destroyed power station mr starosiek noted and then there is the human factor people are still alive he said mathieu boulegue a consulting fellow with the russia and eurasia program at chatham house a london based research organization said that ukraine currently had enough air defense weapon and ammunition to combat the threat of russian drone the cost is irrelevant a long a the west keep providing military assistance to ukraine mr boulegue said the problem for kyiv is the moment they don t have enough stock of ammunition in their air defense chain to shoot down these drone aware of the risk that western ally may grow weary of the cost of supporting ukraine s defense a concern heightened by the transfer of leadership in the u s house of representative to the republican ukrainian official have warned that russian tactic are changing the white house ha said that it is aware of report that the kremlin and tehran are seeking to establish a joint production line for drone in russia over the long term mr boulegue said that would allow moscow to deploy still more drone in attack that is going to put more stress on ukraine s air defense system he said that help explain why ukraine ha adapted it own tactic in part by conducting strike on base deep inside russian territory the goal mr boulegue said is to increase deterrence which they hope will place le stress on air defense for now moscow ha changed how it is using the drone it already ha in hand russian force have increasingly been launching their explosive drone at night and low along the dnipro river making it harder for ukraine to detect them according to yurii ihnat the spokesman for the ukrainian air force who wa speaking on ukrainian radio the radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna he said russia continued it assault on ukraine s infrastructure in kyiv with a swarm of explosive drone throughout monday morning russia s attack on kyiv have been relentless since new year s eve russia followed up it holiday missile attack with drone that flew into the city just after midnight on monday morning air raid siren blared and at least two explosion were heard in the heart of kyiv according to the new york time russia ha made relentless use of the iranian made shahed drone since the fall the drone have an extensive range and explode on impact ukrainian air defense routinely shoot down most of the drone on approach to their target the sheer volume of strike allows some to detonate ukraine largely u u s supplied anti air defense to protect it major city the u s ha granted ten of billion of dollar in military aid to the country the flow of weapon ha put a strain on u s stockpile and congress passed a massive budget granting the pentagon nearly billion to refit the traditional measure of u s military readiness ha been it capacity to supply and carry out two major conflict in separate area of the globe white house national security adviser jake sullivan argued in december that u s support for ukraine ha revealed weakness in that readiness the u s ha sent nearly billion in military aid to ukraine since february and there are plan to send much more the aid is such that president biden s administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used the volume of u s aid to the country ha given rise to some skeptic within the republican party who are calling for greater accountability anders hagstrom is a reporter with fox news digital covering national politics and major breaking news event send tip to anders hagstrom fox com or on twitter hagstrom anders the strike using a u s supplied precision weapon that ha proven critical in enabling ukrainian force to hit key target delivered a new setback for russia which in recent month ha reeled from a ukrainian counteroffensive the ukrainian military ha not directly confirmed the strike but it seemed to acknowledge what appeared to be the same attack that russian authority reported the strategic communication directorate of ukraine s armed force claimed sunday that some mobilized russian soldier were killed in a vocational school building in makiivka and about more were wounded that claim could not be independently verified the russian statement said the strike occurred in the area of makiivka and didn t mention the vocational school meanwhile russia deployed multiple exploding drone in another nighttime attack on ukraine official said monday a the kremlin signaled no letup in it strategy of using bombardment to target the country s energy infrastructure and wear down ukrainian resistance to it invasion ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy ha accused russia of energy terrorism a the aerial bombardment have left many people without heat amid freezing temperature ukrainian official say moscow is weaponizing winter in it effort to demoralize the ukrainian resistance on monday kyiv mayor vitali klitschko said that drone headed for kyiv overnight all of them were destroyed according to air defense force klitschko said drone were destroyed over kyiv three in the outlying kyiv region and over neighboring province energy infrastructure facility were damaged a a result of the attack and an explosion occurred in one city district the mayor said it wasn t immediately clear whether that wa caused by drone or other munition a wounded year old man wa hospitalized klitschko added and emergency power outage were underway in the capital putin insists he had no choice but to send troop into ukraine because it threatened russia s security an assertion condemned by the west which say moscow bear full responsibility for the war russia is currently observing public holiday through jan istanbul hulking ship carrying ukrainian wheat and other grain are backed up along the bosporus here in istanbul a they await inspection before moving on to port around the world the number of ship sailing through this narrow strait which connects black sea port to wider water plummeted when russia invaded ukraine month ago and imposed a naval blockade under diplomatic pressure moscow ha begun allowing some vessel to pa but it continues to restrict most shipment from ukraine which together with russia once exported a quarter of the world s wheat and at the few ukrainian port that are operational russia s missile and drone attack on ukraine s energy grid periodically cripple the grain terminal where wheat and corn are loaded onto ship an enduring global food crisis ha become one of the farthest reaching consequence of russia s war contributing to widespread starvation poverty and premature death the united state and ally are struggling to reduce the damage american official are organizing effort to help ukrainian farmer get food out of their country through rail and road network that connect to eastern europe and on barge traveling up the danube river but a deep winter set in and russia press assault on ukraine s infrastructure the crisis is worsening food shortage are already being exacerbated by a drought in the horn of africa and unusually harsh weather in other part of the world the united nation world food program estimate that more than million people are suffering from or at risk of acute food insecurity more than double the number from we re dealing now with a massive food insecurity crisis antony j blinken the u s secretary of state said last month at a summit with african leader in washington it s the product of a lot of thing a we all know he said including russia s aggression against ukraine the food shortage and high price are causing intense pain across africa asia and the america u s official are especially worried about afghanistan and yemen which have been ravaged by war egypt lebanon and other big food importing nation are finding it difficult to pay their debt and other expense because cost have surged even in wealthy country like the united state and britain soaring inflation driven in part by the war s disruption ha left poorer people without enough to eat by attacking ukraine the breadbasket of the world putin is attacking the world s poor spiking global hunger when people are already on the brink of famine said samantha power the administrator of the united state agency for international development or usaid ukrainian are likening the event to the holodomor when joseph stalin engineered a famine in soviet ruled ukraine year ago that killed million mr blinken announced on dec that the u s government would begin granting blanket exception to it economic sanction program worldwide to ensure that food aid and other assistance kept flowing the action is intended to ensure that company and organization do not withhold assistance for fear of running afoul of u s sanction state department official said it wa the most significant change to u s sanction policy in year the united nation security council adopted a similar resolution on sanction last month but russia s intentional disruption of global food supply pose an entirely different problem moscow ha restricted it own export increasing cost elsewhere most important it ha stopped sale of fertilizer needed by the world s farmer before the war russia wa the biggest exporter of fertilizer it hostility in ukraine have also had a major impact from march to november ukraine exported an average of million metric ton of grain and oilseed per month a steep drop from the five million to seven million metric ton per month it exported before the war began in february according to data from the country s ministry of agrarian policy and food that number would be even lower if not for an agreement forged in july by the united nation turkey russia and ukraine called the black sea grain initiative in which russia agreed to allow export from three ukrainian seaport russia continues to block seven of the port used by ukraine ukraine ha port but five are in crimea which russia seized in besides the three on the black sea three on the danube are operational the initial deal wa only for four month but wa extended in november for another four month when russia threatened to leave it in october global food price surged five to six percent said isobel coleman a deputy administrator at usaid the effect of this war are hugely hugely disruptive she said putin is pushing million of people into poverty while increase in the price of food this past year have been particularly sharp in the middle east north africa and south america no region ha been immune you re looking at price increase of everything from percent in the u s to percent in sudan said sara menker the chief executive of gro intelligence a platform for climate and agriculture data that track food price before the war food price had already climbed to their highest level in over a decade because of pandemic disruption in the supply chain and pervasive drought the united state brazil and argentina key grain producer for the world have experienced three consecutive year of drought the level of the mississippi river fell so much that the barge that carry american grain to port were temporarily grounded the weakening of many foreign currency against the u s dollar ha also forced some country to buy le food on the international market than in year past there were a lot of structural issue and then the war just made it that much worse m menker said u s official say the russian military ha deliberately targeted grain storage facility in ukraine a potential war crime and ha destroyed wheat processing plant many farmer in ukraine have gone to war or fled their land and the infrastructure that processed and carried wheat and sunflower oil to foreign market ha broken down at a farm mile south of kyiv of the employee have enlisted in the army and the farm is struggling with other shortage kees huizinga the dutch co owner said russia s attack on the energy grid have led to the shutdown of a plant that provides his farm and others with nitrogen fertilizer other fertilizer plant in europe were forced to shut down or slow production last year a natural gas price soared a result of the war natural gas is critical for fertilizer production so this year s harvest ha already been reduced mr huizinga said in november and if russian continue like this next year s harvest might even be worse he added that transportation cost have risen sharply for farmer in ukraine before the war farmer shipped out percent of the country s wheat and grain export through the black sea mr huizinga s farm paid to per ton to transport it product to port and onto ship now the cost ha more than doubled he said and an alternative route by truck to romania cost per ton mr huizinga said russia s compromise on black sea shipment ha helped but he suspect moscow is hobbling operation by slowing inspection under the arrangement each vessel leaving one of three ukrainian port on the black sea ha to be inspected by joint team of ukrainian russian turkish and united nation employee once the ship reach istanbul the team look for any unauthorized cargo or crew member and vessel heading to ukraine need to be empty of cargo said ismini palla a spokeswoman for the u n office overseeing the program u n data show that the rate of inspection ha dropped in recent week the party agreed to deploy three team each day m palla said adding that the united nation ha requested more we hope that this will change soon so that the ukrainian port can operate again at higher capacity she said ukrainian export remain a vital element in combating global food insecurity m palla said the party decision in november to extend the agreement contributed to a percent drop in global wheat price over the last six month food price have retreated from high reached this spring according to an index compiled by the united nation but they remain much higher than in previous year an uncertainty for farmer this winter is the soaring price of fertilizer one of their biggest cost farmer have passed on the higher cost by increasing the price of food product and many farmer are using le fertilizer in their field that will result in lower crop yield in the coming season pushing food price higher subsistence farm which produce nearly a third of the world s food are being hit even harder m coleman said in a communiqu issued at the close of their meeting in bali indonesia in november leader of the group of nation said they were deeply concerned by the challenge to global food security and pledged to support the international effort to keep food supply chain functioning we need to strengthen trade cooperation not weaken it ngozi okonjo iweala the director general of the world trade organization said at the summit the u s government spends about billion per year on global food security and it started a program called feed the future after the last big food crisis in that now encompasses country since the start of the ukraine war the united state ha provided more than billion to address the food crisis that includes a million program called agri ukraine which ha helped about farmer in ukraine percent of the total gain access to financing technology transportation seed fertilizer bag and mobile storage unit m coleman said the effort could help rebuild the country while alleviating the global food crisis one fifth of ukraine s economy is in the agriculture sector and a fifth of the country s labor force is connected to it it s hugely important for ukraine s economy she said and for ukraine s economic survival ukraine launched a major attack against a building housing russian soldier in the donetsk region on new year s day a full picture of the casualty is still emerging ukraine claimed that about had died while russia said yesterday that service member had been killed but even with the lower figure the attack wa one of the deadliest strike against russian force in ukraine since the war began mistake by russian force may have contributed to the toll one russian military blogger said that ammunition stored in the same building had detonated in the strike and russian state medium outlet said that the attack had been caused by the soldier use of cellphone which helped ukrainian force pinpoint their location detail ukraine used himars a guided rocket system supplied by the u s since june these weapon have helped ukraine to shift the momentum of the war food the russian blockade of grain shipment from ukraine ha made global starvation worse china s economic path forward is likely be uneven and painful year of covid lockdown have taken a brutal toll on it business after the country s chaotic reopening the

neighborhood in kyiv took a different approach in the first moment of new year s day despite the risk dozen of people in a district of high rise apartment block went out onto their balcony and sang the ukrainian national anthem just after midnight a bit off key and raucous with some voice sounding drunken they recorded themselves in video a a swarm of exploding drone buzzed over the capital in an attack that followed a missile barrage earlier on new year s eve killing at least one person and injuring more than others posted meme and exchanged joke ukrainian official including president volodymyr zelensky labeled russia a terrorist state air defense fired through the night a new system of searchlight intended to spot nocturnal drone swept kyiv s sky air raid alert sounded and boom echoed through the city s street still in one central area of the capital some new year s party could be heard continuing even after the blast the momentary good cheer masked some hard reality for a country that remains under assault over the fall kyiv turned the tide in ground combat in the southeast leading seesaw fighting to resume but whatever it success on the battlefield ten month into the war ukraine can do little to stop russia from launching missile strike even if it air defense lessen their impact there is little choice now for ukrainian but to endure to take whatever russia can shoot at them while keeping up their resolve and defiance in the new year s eve attack the russian military fired cruise missile the ukrainian general staff headquarters said sunday in a morning update on the war a drone attack followed with flying bomb launched overnight before the new year and after midnight the ukrainian military said it shot all of them down there were no mean to independently confirm the statement in the capital the authority began the year collecting mangled metallic debris from the missile and drone shot down over the city fragment landed on car in the road and at a subway stop temporarily closing one line of the subway official said ukraine ha been developing long range drone to strike back and russian airfield from which bomber take off to launch cruise missile suffered drone attack twice in december but these are pinprick compared with moscow s massive wave of strike on ukrainian city and civilian infrastructure like power plant electrical pylon and hydroelectric dam there have been since those attack began in october through the fall mr zelensky ha persuaded ally to rush delivery of several sophisticated air defense system to ukraine in ground combat movement ha mostly stalled since the ukrainian military pushed russian force from the west bank of the dnipro river in the kherson region in southern ukraine in november the advance allowed ukraine to move artillery forward now many though not all russian supply line in southern ukraine are within range of ukrainian long range artillery which is hitting target behind russian line even a the line themselves do not shift to the east in the donbas region russia continues to press it only remaining offensive the russian force is partly made up of unit gathered by a private military contracting company and includes convict who have been promised pardon in exchange for fighting for moscow in ukraine trench warfare ha swayed back and forth over outlying district of the city of bakhmut and nearby village for month with advance and retreat on both side often measured in a few hundred yard the institute for the study of war a washington based research group said over the weekend that the russian attack had slowed for lack of artillery ammunition movement wa also slowed for both side by wet wintertime condition that can confine tank and other heavy armored vehicle

that the protest occurred because of the incident but they evidenced the pent up anger and frustration the chinese people had toward their government the sheer volume of social medium account documenting the protest overwhelmed china s censor and algorithm breaching the famous great firewall of china to reach twitter and other western platform the task proved so difficult that china

orthodox church pose a uniquely subversive threat a widely trusted institution that is not only an incubator of pro russia sentiment but is also infiltrated by priest monk and nun who have aided russia in the war recent month have brought a quick succession of search of church and monastery and decree and law restricting the activity of the russian aligned church confusingly named the ukrainian orthodox church of the moscow patriarchate on tuesday ukraine s supreme court upheld a law that requires truthful naming of religious organization if they are affiliated with a country at war with ukraine a law tailored to force the church to call itself russian president volodymyr zelensky this month asked parliament to ban any church that answer to russia though no detail have been proposed yet so it remains unclear how that would work the ukrainian authority plan to revoke the russian church s lease on two revered house of worship the holy dormition cathedral and the refectory

monastery of the cave appealed to mr zelensky in a video do you want to take away faith in people take away the last hope he said do not tell u which church to go to mr zelensky who is jewish and ukrainian law enforcement agency say the crackdown ha nothing to do with religious freedom which they argue doe not extend to espionage sedition sabotage or treason for century ukraine s orthodox church were under the russian church whose leadership in moscow wholeheartedly support president vladimir v putin s war but in recent year many priest and parish and million of the faithful have switched allegiance to the independent new orthodox church of ukraine a migration accelerated by the war the two church are virtually identical in liturgy what separate them are politics and nationalism early in december the ukrainian orthodox church called the accusation of collaboration between it clergy and russia unproven and groundless the russian aligned church which still represents million of ukrainian insists that it cut tie with it russian hierarchy at the onset of the war the independent ukrainian church call that break insincere and flatly condemns it counterpart

in the st michael s golden domed monastery in kyiv outside military analyst have seen reason for ukraine s concern the church of the moscow patriarchate materially supported russia s annexation of crimea and the invasion of eastern ukraine the institute for the study of war a u s based analytical group wrote in a research note on the role of the russian affiliated church in the war evidence of

force cracked down on private charity in an effort to steer the population to russian humanitarian aid program which required registration with occupation authority it wa a policy of forcing dependence on russia when a priest nonetheless continued operating a soup kitchen the russian aligned church excommunicated him ukrainian official say that priest and monk or people posing a them who are also spy have caused problem for ukraine s military at one monastery north of kyiv this month the authority said they found six men in monk robe all of whom were athletically built spoke russian but no ukrainian and had no document the police arrested the men and are investigating whether they are spy being a priest is ideal cover for any intelligence agent said a ukrainian intelligence official knowledgeable about the investigation of the russian aligned church but who wa not authorized to speak publicly people are ready to trust you because you are a priest for his part mr pavlenko the abbot who wa later convicted of espionage took to visiting wounded ukrainian soldier at a hospital according to pavlo dubyna a former resident of the town and acquaintance of mr pavlenko after such visit he would walk in the street and speak on his cellphone mr dubyna said ukrainian authority arrested the priest in april when the russian military wa still bombarding sievierodonetsk which it captured in june in an act they say proved mr pavlenko s culpability moscow accepted the priest in a prisoner swap for an american held by russia suedi murekezi an air force veteran who had been living in southern ukraine before the war evidence from the trial opened a window into the priest s blending of espionage and vendetta against priest in the independent ukrainian church which before the war had been winning away follower from the russian church prosecutor presented what they said were short description of the rival clergy sent to the russian army by mr pavlenko the spiritual guide for the nationalist brigade and the ukrainian army in the luhansk region said a march note that said the priest in question should be killed another message described another priest in the ukrainian church whose brother wa fighting in the war and said i think we need to put an end to him too a he is not our guy kyiv ukraine russia rained missile and exploding drone on ukraine s capital and other city on saturday in a deadly new year s eve assault punctuating president vladimir v putin s stated resolve to prosecute a war he called a sacred duty to our ancestor and descendant the aerial bombardment killed at least one person and partly destroyed a hotel in the capital kyiv inflicted damage elsewhere and forced ukraine s war ravaged electric utility to pre emptively shut off power there are explosion in kyiv kyiv s mayor vitali klitschko wrote on the telegram messaging app stay in shelter describing the new year s eve assault a inhuman and russia a a terrorist state president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine directed his rage at mr putin and his subordinate declaring in a videotaped reaction that those who give order for such strike and those who carry them out will not receive a pardon to put it mildly even for resident inured to brazen russian bombing the wail of air raid siren and the explosive thud on new year s eve and into the first hour of were especially galling if mr putin s intent wa to demoralize them the aerial assault only generated more hate we know how vile they are and everybody knew they were ready to attack on the holiday in theory said viktoria dubrovina a retired kyiv subway worker who joined others inspecting the damage after siren stopped but we hoped something would change but they did it in his new year s address mr zelensky said that ukrainian woke up on feb the first day of the invasion into another life he said that the first russian missile barrage finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusion we saw who wa who what friend and enemy are capable of and most importantly what we are capable of he added of the coming year let this year be the year of return of soldier to family prisoner to home and ukrainian land to ukraine the temporarily occupied will become forever free he said the attack began in midafternoon only hour before mr zelensky had been scheduled to deliver a much anticipated speech to a nation where the russian invasion ha shaped the past month and could for many more air defense crew shot down of at least cruise missile launched by russia on saturday afternoon the top ukrainian military commander gen valeriy zaluzhnyi said on telegram the missile had been launched from russian strategic bomber over the caspian sea and from land based launcher he said air raid siren rang out again after midnight and several loud explosion were heard in central kyiv in the ensuing hour in an otherwise dark and still city with resident confined in their apartment by the curfew ukrainian official said air defense system had successfully hit several target no injury were immediately reported in his own traditional new year s eve address mr putin broke from practice and delivered the speech not at the kremlin but flanked by soldier at an unspecified military base he struck a defiant tone repeating claim that his invasion of ukraine wa a defensive struggle for russia s existence mr zelensky whose impassioned nightly speech have become a rallying cry for ukrainian patriotism and defiance of russa had warned on thursday that the russian military might launch another wave of missile attack before any year end commemoration moscow fired a large volley this past week disrupting electrical power in kyiv and in other city what electricity had been available before the strike wa lost on saturday in kyiv in odesa in the south and in city of the dnipropetrovsk region in central ukraine a the authority switched off power to prevent short circuit on the grid caused by any strike damage within a few minute of the explosion in kyiv report of damage in several neighborhood came out and a video posted on telegram showed smoke rising above the city kyrylo tymoshenko an aide to mr zelensky said in a post on social medium that the city of khmelnytskyi in western ukraine had been attacked by exploding drone and that two people were wounded in the zaporizhzhia region he said residential building were damaged between the larger wave of strike on thursday and saturday the russian military had kept up the pressure on ukraine s energy grid with smaller scale missile attack according to ukraine s military general staff the general staff said in a statement on saturday morning that over the past day russia fired five missile and exploding drone and it carried out airstrikes on civilian infrastructure how long russia can sustain the barrage ha been a pressing question in ukraine which ha stymied and beat back the russian military across several front since mr putin launched the invasion in february ukraine ha received increasingly sophisticated defense weaponry from the united state and other nato nation striking many of the incoming russian missile and drone before they reach their target mr putin who ha repeatedly said ukraine is not a legitimate country used his year end speech on saturday a a platform to assert that moral and historical righteousness is on our side he defined the war in ukraine a russian sacred duty to our ancestor and descendant russian soldier he said were fighting to secure peace and security guarantee for russia while the west wa using ukraine to weaken and split up russia and reprising his reference to antiwar russian a traitor mr putin described the year a one that clearly separated courage and heroism from betrayal and cowardice mr putin wa working to rally russian citizen who are increasingly feeling the effect of a conflict that ha left their country the most economically isolated since the breakup of the soviet union three decade ago moreover russian troop have suffered a series of embarrassing setback on the battlefield and the military s strategy ha been increasingly criticized even by domestic supporter of russia s invasion while the kremlin initially envisioned a quick conquest of ukraine in february sending troop speeding into city with only a few day supply the invasion ha mired russia in a grueling war and revealed weakness in it conventional military ability american official say that more than russian soldier have been killed or injured since the invasion in february we will do all we can to help the family of our killed comrade mr putin said in his remark on saturday i share your pain with all my heart in addition to trying to raise spirit on the home front mr putin s speech also demonstrated his latest attempt to signal to the west that he ha no plan to ease his onslaught against ukraine his singular focus on the war in his new year s speech showed that the kremlin had fully dispensed with it earlier strategy of playing down the war for the broader public even though official still refer to the fighting a only a special military operation new year s eve wa also a reminder of one of mr putin s biggest miscalculation western unity in the face of the invasion chancellor olaf scholz of germany in his own traditional new year s eve speech said that despite a difficult year germany and the rest of europe had withstood unexpected hardship caused by mr putin s war mr scholz s first month a chancellor have been among the most tumultuous of germany s postwar history it wa not what he nor nearly anyone in europe had expected putin is conducting an imperialist war of aggression at the heart of europe he said in a speech broadcast on saturday evening this watershed moment is also a tough test for u and our country but on the eve of a new year mr scholz argued that also reflected strength to celebrate the history of is not purely one of war suffering and worry he said after all putin did not manage a he had planned to overrun ukraine in a matter of day on the contrary the ukrainian are bravely defending their homeland thanks in part to our help he said and we will continue to support ukraine for the second day in a row russia launched an aerial barrage at ukraine on friday but the ukrainian military said it had intercepted all of the attack a the warring nation wage a lethal struggle of shifting offensive and defensive tactic the latest assault used iranian made drone overnight all of which were shot down the ukrainian air force said a rare shutout coming a day after russian force fired cruise missile and a smaller number of drone some of which reached their target the attack came a nato s secretary general jens stoltenberg urged other country to step up military support for ukraine to fight off the russian invasion providing more weapon and perhaps more important he said more ammunition for the weapon it already ha while there is likely to be a negotiated peace eventually he said in an interview with the german news agency dpa the military picture will determine the strength of ukraine s bargaining position so if you want a negotiated peaceful solution ensuring that ukraine prevails a an independent democratic state the best way of achieving that is to provide ukraine with military support he said for ukraine the kremlin s invasion in february put an initial premium on antitank weapon a movement slowed to a crawl more and better artillery became crucial each time the west supplied the weapon after ukraine s force began to mount successful counteroffensive and retake territory the kremlin shifted three month ago to increased aerial attack on ukraine s energy infrastructure and it city leaving civilian without power heat cell service and sometimes water in deadly winter weather that ha made air defense paramount for ukraine a those defense have become more robust again with western help and more skilled shooting down most of the incoming missile and drone the russian have adopted the tactic of mass barrage trying to overwhelm defensive system in hope that some warhead will reach their target running low on missile the russian are relying more on drone bought from iran the drone are much cheaper but also pack le of a punch and are far easier to intercept ukrainian troop have sometimes used small arm to shoot them down so the russian tend to launch them in the dark president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said on friday in his nightly video address that air defense had been a primary topic of a meeting he held earlier in the day with military leader this year we not only maintained our air defense but we made them stronger than ever but in the new year ukrainian air defense will become even stronger even more effective he said ukrainian air defense can become the most powerful in europe and this will be a guarantee of security not only for our country but also for the entire continent mr zelensky and president vladimir v putin of russia are scheduled to give new year s eve speech to their respective nation on saturday a likely split screen of alternative reality mr zelensky s address tend to take grim development head on mr putin s usually elide bad news for russia either ignoring the war or presenting false picture of russian progress and of ukraine a a phony without an identity controlled by fascist that commits rampant atrocity on thursday mr zelensky signed off on a law expanding the government s regulatory power over news medium according to ukrainian medium it give the government the power to fine medium organization revoke their license temporarily block certain online outlet without a court order and request that social medium platform and search engine remove content that violates the law ukrainian official have described the law a one step toward meeting the condition for someday joining the european union but ukrainian journalist and press freedom watchdog say it go much further and voiced concern that kyiv is using the e u standard a a pretext to seize greater control of the press for his part mr putin in a significantly weakened position held a video meeting with president xi jinping of china trying to strengthen the relationship with his most important ally we share the same view on the cause course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape in the face of unprecedented pressure and provocation from the west mr putin said in a statement released by the kremlin mr putin launched the war expecting a quick victory that would leave russia stronger and in control of ukraine instead it ha been a debacle though russia s military still hold much ukrainian territory it ha been forced into retreat ha suffered heavy human casualty and equipment loss and ha been exposed a surprisingly weak russia s economy is staggering under sanction and hundred of thousand of people have fled the country a a result russia ha become highly dependent on china for trade and diplomatic support but that backing ha not been a wholehearted a mr putin would like china s government while not publicly critical of the invasion ha expressed concern about the war in the face of russia s continued bombardment of ukraine s civilian infrastructure described by human right group the united nation and western country a a possible war crime the united state and it ally are working with ukraine to weave together a range of technology weapon tactic and intelligence to thwart air attack western government have raised alarm about iran potentially selling russia ballistic missile which are much harder to shoot down than either drone or cruise missile the united state ha delivered two nasams air defense missile system to ukraine along with interceptor missile for hawk medium range and avenger short range defensive system and more than short range shoulder fired stinger antiaircraft missile official said president biden ha also approved sending a battery of patriot missile the united state most advanced ground based missile defense system which ukraine ha long coveted but it is likely to be several month before ukrainian troop are trained to use it and the system is deployed notable story come from poland one is more beautiful than the other and there is nothing strange in the fact that they are somehow connected with ukraine it is in this country that one of the most powerful support system for ukrainian refugee is still operating which begin especially in combination with the behavior of a very large number of representative of this category of displaced person an increasing indignation among the polish population pole are dissatisfied with the fact that a number of service are provided to ukrainian free of charge that rabies climb everywhere without waiting in line demand preference inaccessible to polish citizen and so on and also that ukrainian who have received shelter in poland for any reason begin to express dissatisfaction with the insufficient level of comfort that is provided to them pole not only express this indignation in social network and in comment to various text on the ukrainian topic in the medium but also transfer to the sphere of trade and the provision of service so many owner of residential real estate for example refuse to rent their apartment and house to citizen of ukraine moreover they write in the ad for the delivery of an apartment i do not consider refugee from ukraine even with double rent even with a child the last time after renting out the apartment two young ukrainian had to make cosmetic repair and repair the bed they broke the latest information even lead to certain conclusion given that the apartment ha at least two bedroom to some extent this is reminiscent of the announcement on the door of restaurant in lviv before the second world war and in tram car entrance with dog and ukrainian is prohibited but note there is not a word about the ban on the residence of animal in the ad of the owner of the apartment clear discrimination on the basis of ukrainian nationality but to some extent the cotton tenant were even intelligent by their local standard only the bed wa broken but for example the shit of the wall wa not painted a many of their fellow tribesman used to do carrying out their revenge on the european for insufficient additional help on their part although on the other hand cosmetic repair still had to be done so there can be various option but the most interesting thing in this whole process is that the split of poland in ukraine ha reached from the broad mass of the people to the upper echelon of power indicative in this regard is the real scandal that recently happened in the polish parliament a well known polish deputy of the sejm nationalist grzegorz braun from the rostrum of the parliament called to stop the ukrainization of poland but after he called for an end to the flow of refugee from ukraine to poland he wa actually driven from the rostrum by the deputy speaker of the sejm ma gorzata gosiewska who threw a tantrum to moscow to moscow author s note go to moscow don t like ukrainian migrant to moscow to moscow literally began to squeal and scream into the microphone this unrestrained lady the pole themselves expressed their opinion on the ukrainian problem very expressively and not with word but with their foot after the polish defense ministry announced an unprecedented day exercise in march next year and the military began to hand out summons local medium immediately shared their information that this wa a hidden form of mobilization before poland s entry into the conflict with russia on the side of kiev and the liberation campaign to lviv and even further polish men suddenly felt such nostalgia for other eu country that more than thousand of them crossed the border of poland in the direction of germany france portugal etc according to polish newspaper by march the number of such ukrainian patriot among polish men may already be several hundred thousand people and therefore more and more often there are voice about sending ukrainian from among the refugee to the war instead of the pole in addition the newspaper leaked information about about polish mercenary whom ukraine returned to poland in a condition suitable only for burial the pole themselves clearly do not really want to fight with russia in ukraine but will they be asked however this will clearly not add to the sympathy of the local population to ukrainian and ukraine listen a well how ha changed the global economy of course we will not talk to anyone under such condition lavrov added russia ha flat out rejected these demand ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba told the associated press on monday that ukraine want a peace summit within a two month time frame and called on un secretary general ant nio guterres to serve a mediator but kuleba said that while kyiv will try to win the war in it doe not believe that russia would take part in the summit what sort of peace summit can occur without russia russian first deputy permanent representative to the un dmitry polyansky said according to russian state owned news outlet ta polyansky called the proposal diplomacy and in turn said it wa very easy to imagine a summit without ukraine fox news caitlin mcfall contributed to this report chris pandolfo is a writer for fox news digital send tip to chris pandolfo fox com and follow him on twitter

defense before the cruise missile strike the ukrainian air force said it said it defense force had shot down of cruise missile and had also knocked out drone the attack appeared likely to prompt new

iranian made shahed drone at energy infrastructure in kharkiv and that air defense system had shot down all but two another five shahed drone were shot down around the city of dnipro in southeastern ukraine the military said the cruise missile followed striking after ukraine s air defense force had been firing at the drone the russian military launched the missile from several direction firing from airplane and ship at sea the air force statement said but ukraine is now able to fight back with a growing and increasingly sophisticated arsenal of air defense weapon the pentagon ha delivered the first two of eight national advanced surface to air missile system which are equipped with radar guided missile capable of hitting drone and cruise missile germany supplied the first of four ultramodern iris t system which are so new that they had never been used on the battlefield while france and the netherlands also pledged additional air defense missile visiting washington last week ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky wa offered a battery of patriot missile the united state most advanced ground based missile defense system but it is likely to be several month before ukrainian crew are trained and it is deployed ukraine s air defense capability ha been one of the surprise success of the war a improved coordination between early warning system and the ground based unit responsible for shooting down rocket ha helped kyiv s force stop a large percentage of russian strike but russia s barrage are often so overwhelming about missile are launched in a typical barrage ukraine s military intelligence agency ha said that plenty still get through and russia appears to have more weapon in it stockpile due in part to the growing supply of exploding drone from iran and even successful shoot down pose risk a the twisted silvery metallic debris rain down on city on thursday two fragment landed in a playground in the pechersk neighborhood of kyiv it wa a first for u that it wa so close said galina khomina a graphic designer who wa pushing her year old daughter nastya on a swing set in the playground a few hour after the strike she said she couldn t stay home in fear despite the near miss we hope it will end soon m khomina said we are used to it and we are not afraid life go on you only have one life washington the biden administration ha embarked on a broad effort to halt iran s ability to produce and deliver drone to russia for use in the war in ukraine an endeavor that ha echo of it yearslong program to cut off tehran s access to nuclear technology in interview in the united state europe and the middle east a range of intelligence military and national security official have described an expanding u s program that aim to choke off iran s ability to manufacture the drone make it harder for the russian to launch the unmanned kamikaze aircraft and if all else fails to provide the ukrainian with the defense necessary to shoot them out of the sky the breadth of the effort ha become clearer in recent week the administration ha accelerated it move to deprive iran of the western made component needed to manufacture the drone being sold to russia after it became apparent from examining the wreckage of intercepted drone that they are stuffed with made in america technology u s force are helping ukraine s military to target the site where the drone are being prepared for launch a difficult task because the russian are moving the launch site around from soccer field to parking lot and the american are rushing in new technology designed to give early warning of approaching drone swarm to improve ukraine s chance of bringing them down with everything from gunfire to missile but all three approach have run into deep challenge and the drive to cut off critical part for the drone is already proving a difficult a the decade old drive to deprive iran of the component needed to build the delicate centrifuge it u to enrich near bomb grade uranium the iranian american intelligence official have said in recent week are applying to the drone program their expertise about how to spread nuclear centrifuge manufacturing around the country and to find dual use technology on the black market to sidestep export control in fact one of the iranian company named by britain france and germany a a key manufacturer of one of the two type of drone being bought by the russian qods aviation ha appeared for year on the united nation list of supplier to iran s nuclear and missile program the company which is owned by iran s military ha expanded it line of drone despite wave of sanction the administration s scramble to deal with the iranian supplied drone come at a significant moment in the war just a ukraine is using it own drone to strike deep into russia including an attack this week on a base housing some of the country s strategic bomber and it come a official in washington and london warn that iran may be about to provide russia with missile helping alleviate moscow s acute shortage official across the western alliance say they are convinced that iran and russia both isolated by american led sanction are building a new alliance of convenience one senior military official said that partnership had deepened quickly after iran s agreement to supply drone to the russian last summer bailed putin out the biden administration having abandoned hope of reviving the nuclear agreement with tehran ha been adding new sanction every few week in the effort to stop the drone attack mr biden s aide are also engaging an ally with a long history of undermining iran s nuclear program israel in a secure video meeting last thursday with israel s top national security military and intelligence official jake sullivan the national security adviser discussed iran s growing military relationship with russia including the transfer of weapon the kremlin is deploying against ukraine targeting it civilian infrastructure and russia s provision of military technology to iran in return the white house said in a statement outlining the meeting the statement did not offer detail about how the two country decided to address the issue but the fact that the administration chose to highlight the discussion in a quarterly meeting normally focused on disrupting iran s nuclear capability wa notable israel and the united state have a long history of operating together in dealing with technological threat emanating from tehran together they developed one of the world s most famous and sophisticated cyberattacks using computer code that wa later called stuxnet to attack iran s nuclear centrifuge facility since then israel ha made little secret of it attempt to sabotage nuclear enrichment center in a statement adrienne watson the spokeswoman for the national security council acknowledged the scope of the broad drive against iran s drone program we are looking at way to target iranian u a v production through sanction export control and talking to private company whose part have been used in the production she said using the acronym for unmanned aerial vehicle she added we are assessing further step we can take in term of export control to restrict iran s access to technology used in drone iran s interest in drone date back more than three decade a the country looked for way that it could monitor and harass ship in the persian gulf the mohajer i a predecessor to one of the drone now being sold to the russian made it first flight in progress wa slow but may have been aided in when the central intelligence agency took a stealthy unarmed rq from the pentagon s fleet in afghanistan and flew it over iran in what appeared to be an effort to map some of the hundred of tunnel dug by the iranian to hide element of their nuclear program a malfunction led to the aircraft landing in the desert and president obama briefly considered sending in a navy seal team to blow it up before it fell into the hand of iranian engineer senior official later reported he decided not to take the risk and within day the iranian paraded the drone through the street of tehran a propaganda victory but american intelligence official later concluded that the aircraft likely proved a bonanza for iranian drone designer who could reverse engineer the craft it wa not until that iran announced it wa beginning to develop attack drone some in cooperation with russia many of the first were placed in the hand of iranian backed militia including houthi rebel in yemen and they were used most effectively in in attack on two saudi oil processing facility run by saudi aramco the state owned oil company american official said the experience in saudi arabia and the targeting of american force in syria and elsewhere gave them an appreciation of iranian drone capability and the challenge of dealing with kamikaze raid in which a small explosive is secured in the drone s nose but the aftermath of the invasion of ukraine underscored that iran knew how to mass produce the aircraft a particular worry at a moment when there are discussion of opening an iranian plant inside russia the iranian program ha hardly been without it problem delivery so far have come episodically a russia and iran retrofitted the drone to operate in the cold of a ukrainian winter and iran ha run into supply chain issue a problem the united state is seeking to worsen nonetheless despite year of sanction on iran s defense sector iranian drone still are built largely with american and western part when photograph began to circulate of circuit board from downed drone visibly packed with chip from american manufacturer the white house ordered a crackdown including call to the firm whose product had been discovered almost all had the same reaction these are unrestricted dual use item whose circulation is almost impossible to stop the biden administration is trying anyway in september the administration tightened sanction specifically naming company involved with building the aircraft for russia that wa followed by further action in november against company like safiran airport service a tehran based firm that it accused of shipping the drone on behalf of the russian government in november the treasury department sanctioned two company based in the united arab emirate a key u s ally accusing them of collaborating with safiran michael kofman the director of russian study at cna a research institute in arlington va said that the sanction were hardly an instant solution export control are going to have an effect but you have to be realistic about the timeline on which they will work mr kofman said sanction delay and make costly acquisition of component he said but determined country will get their hand on tech for narrow defense application or adjust their weapon design to what they can get even if it s le reliable a the war grind on the united state britain france and germany are pressing the secretary general of the united nation antonio guterres to open a formal investigation into whether russia and iran are together violating the term of a u n restriction on the export of sophisticated arm from iran mr guterres ha made clear that his top priority is executing a deal with russia over the export of ukrainian grain to alleviate shortage and his aide say now is not the time to risk that agreement with an investigation whose conclusion seems predictable iran appears to be flying drone to russian force on cargo aircraft usually over route that leave little opportunity to intercept them that mean attempting to attack them on the ground no easy task until a little more than a month ago american and british government official say the drone were largely based in crimea then they disappeared for a number of day reappearing in russian occupied area of zaporizhzhia province the movement have been tracked by american and ukrainian official some sitting side by side in military intelligence center but the drone are highly mobile with launch system mounted on truck and the russian know they are being hunted so they move them to safer location which make tracking and striking them a difficult proposition the change of launch site is likely due to russian concern about the vulnerability of crimea while it is also convenient for resupply from the weapon likely arrival point in russia at astrakhan a british military assessment earlier this month said there is growing evidence that the military relationship may be a two way street britain ha accused russia of planning to give iran advanced military component in exchange for hundred of drone iran ha become one of russia s top military backer britain s defense minister ben wallace told parliament last week in return for having supplied more than kamikaze drone russia now intends to provide iran with advanced military component undermining both middle east and international security we must expose that deal mr wallace said a number of american company including the edgesource corporation and bluehalo both based in virginia have provided training or technology to help detect and defeat the russian drone u s official said edgesource ha donated about million in system including one called windtalker to help ukraine locate identify and track incoming hostile drone more than mile away while at the same time identifying ukraine s own drone in the same airspace said joseph urbaniak the company s chief operating officer the united state ha provided ukraine with other technology to counter drone most recently a part of a million shipment of arm and equipment the pentagon announced on dec but american official have declined to provide detail on the specific assistance citing operational security a the battle for ukraine turn into a bloody mile by mile fight in numbing cold ukrainian and russian official have insisted that they are willing to discus making peace but with a drumbeat of statement in recent day making clear that each side s demand are flatly unacceptable to the other there appears to be little hope for serious negotiation in the near future ukraine this week proposed a peace summit by the end of february but said russia could participate only if it first face a war crime tribunal that drew a frosty response from the kremlin with foreign minister sergey v lavrov saying that kyiv must accept all of russia s demand including that it give up four ukrainian region that moscow claim to have annexed otherwise he said the russian army will deal with this issue russia doe not fully control any of those region and ha even lost territory there in recent month a ukrainian force fight to reclaim all the land seized by moscow but on wednesday the kremlin spokesman dmitri s peskov said it wa impossible to accept a peace plan that did not recognize those four ukrainian region a part of russia any plan that doe not take into account these circumstance cannot claim to be a peace plan mr peskov said according to the state run ta news agency the hard line position suggest that both side believe they have more to gain on the battlefield analyst say this suggests there is not necessarily a push for a negotiated peace or even some sort of negotiation but still a push for whatever endgame is being sought militarily said marnie howlett a lecturer in russian and eastern european politics at the university of oxford ukraine hold the momentum having retaken much of the land that russia captured early in the war but moscow s force still occupy large chunk of the east and south and russia is readying more troop and launching aerial attack on infrastructure deepening ukrainian misery even a russian soldier struggle on the ground on wednesday the ukrainian military said that russia had launched a barrage of strike at the southern city of kherson including one that damaged a maternity ward a official continued to urge on resident to evacuate image shared by one ukrainian official after the strike showed blown out window a hole in the roof and pile of rubble in one of the room kherson ha been battered by shelling since ukraine retook the city last month with russian force using new position on the opposite bank of the dnipro river to launch near daily barrage at the city the war ha now passed it th day there have been no peace talk between ukraine and russia since the early week of the conflict which began when russia launched a full scale invasion on feb and both side have signaled a determination to keep fighting visiting washington last week president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said that weapon and aid from the united state and ally would help ukraine sustain it resistance well into emphasizing that we have to defeat the kremlin on the battlefield and president vladimir v putin of russia in a brief televised interview over the weekend said that he wa prepared to negotiate over acceptable outcome but insisted that percent of our citizen are ready to sacrifice everything for the interest of the motherland western official have dismissed mr putin s periodic offer to negotiate a empty gesture in calling for talk without hinting that he is prepared to abandon his onslaught and repeating a propaganda line that russia is fighting a defensive war for it own survival mr putin is trying to send the message that russia will eventually win and that the sooner ukraine capitulates the fewer people will die they are both in it for the long haul said karin von hippel u b director general of the royal united service institute a military research institute in london putin still feel he can win this he still ha more men and more money although you wonder what his tipping point will be while russia s loss are believed to be enormous more than killed and injured american official have said mr putin ha signaled recently that he is prepared to accept many more he told senior military official in a televised meeting last week that of the reserve called up this fall half were still at training base and represented a strategic reserve for future fighting on wednesday russia s prime minister mikhail mishustin said that his country s economy had contracted by percent over the past month that is a smaller decline than many expert had predicted at the start of the war and suggests that moscow ha so far managed to weather the effect of western sanction this month mr putin emphasized that there were no limit to russia s military spending but a the evidence of russian military atrocity ha multiplied and with ukraine s continued battlefield success kyiv s negotiating position ha hardened in late march week after the invasion and with russian troop still threatening to seize the capital ukrainian negotiator at a meeting in istanbul proposed adopting neutral status in effect abandoning a bid to join nato which russia ha long opposed in exchange for security guarantee from other nation they also suggested separate talk on the status of crimea the ukrainian peninsula seized by russia in and of donbas the eastern area claimed by moscow those term are now off the table the emotional background in ukraine ha changed very very much mykhailo podolyak a top adviser to mr zelensky told the bbc in august we have seen too many war crime last month addressing a summit of leader of the group of nation mr zelensky presented a point formula for peace that called for russia s full withdrawal from ukrainian territory including crimea and donbas it also demanded an international tribunal to try russian war crime moscow s release of all political prisoner and those forcibly deported during the war compensation from russia for war damage and step by the international community to ensure the safety of ukraine s nuclear power plant and to provide for it food and energy security demanding maximum concession is a time honored negotiating tactic but analyst say that ukraine is eager to demonstrate particularly to european ally that are enduring higher energy cost this winter because of a russian oil embargo that it see a path out of the conflict the ukrainian proposal offer a glimpse at ukraine s vision of how the war with russia could one day end said stella ghervas a professor of russian history at newcastle university in britain in the war of modern european history she said winner on the battlefield have often been the one to push hardest for peace in the napoleonic war world war i and world war ii the successful military leader and peacemaker were often the same individual she said those who sought peace were the same who had successfully fought the war the serious initiative for peacemaking during the great war in europe have come always from the strongest party on the battlefield still ukraine s peace proposal have received a generally cautious response when mr zelensky mentioned his plan at a joint news conference with president biden last week mr biden did not comment on the proposal saying only that the united state and ukraine share the exact same vision for peace on wednesday the french defense minister s bastien lecornu visited the ukrainian capital for the first time since the war began following a pledge by president emmanuel macron to send more weapon to ukraine mr lecornu laid a wreath at a monument to ukrainian who have died in the war many in ukraine and in eastern europe have been critical of france s response to the war drawing a link between it relatively limited military support and mr macron s approach to russia while unequivocally backing the ukrainian cause mr macron ha said we must not humiliate russia and called security guarantee for russia an essential part of peace talk mr zelensky said this week that he had sought india s help on the peace plan in a call with prime minister narendra modi whose government hold the group of rotating chair and ha been mentioned a a possible mediator in talk mr modi conveyed india s support for any peace effort but did not mention the ukrainian plan another potential interlocutor is turkey which this summer brokered a deal involving russia ukraine and the united nation to allow for the export of ukrainian grain through the black sea that agreement along with occasional exchange of prisoner between ukraine and russia ha offered hope that the two side could one day discus a cease fire but analyst say that russia must demonstrate that it will negotiate in good faith and act on the term of any peace agreement in order to earn some level of trust by ukraine which it ha invaded twice in le than a decade ukraine will always be a neighbor of russia said m howlett the oxford lecturer any peace settlement ha to come with the acknowledgment and understanding that russia isn t going anywhere a covid case rise in china the u s said it would require all traveler from china to show a negative covid test a well a

those who recently traveled there to be tested for the coronavirus upon arrival if they tested positive they would be sent into a weeklong quarantine india ha also made covid testing for traveler from china mandatory and taiwan plan to take similar step reuters report italy said all traveler from china would be required to take covid antigen test upon arrival so that the virus could be sequenced if it were detected ukrainian and russian official have floated peace proposal and insisted they are willing to hold talk on ending the war now in it th month but the demand by each side are unacceptable to the other leading u s and european official to conclude that serious negotiation on a peace deal are unlikely to take place in the near future this week dmytro kuleba ukraine s foreign minister proposed a peace summit to be held by the end of february but he told the associated press that the country would negotiate with russia only if moscow first faced a war crime tribunal russia responded by saying that kyiv would have to give up the four region that moscow annexed this fall which is flatly unacceptable to ukraine there cannot be a peace plan for ukraine that doe not take into account today s reality with russian territory the kremlin spokesman said russia s foreign minister sergey lavrov warned that if ukraine did not give up the region the russian army will deal with this issue more fighting to come the hard line position suggest that both side believe they have more to gain militarily ukraine hold the battlefield momentum but moscow s force still occupy large chunk of the

caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news combat raged around the city of kreminna in eastern ukraine on tuesday a ukrainian force edged closer to reclaiming that small but strategically important city while the russian battled to defend some of their hardest fought gain of the war kreminna is a gateway to two much larger city nearby sievierodonetsk and lysychansk important industrial center in the donbas region that fell to russia after a grueling and costly summer campaign president vladimir v putin of russia ha called conquering and annexing the donbas the heart of the war effort since enduring a series of humiliating retreat the russian military ha fortified it line near kreminna with a series of defensive barrier part of it effort to solidify it position up and down a jagged front that stretch for hundred of mile retaking the city and other town nearby would expand the ukrainian foothold in the region and give them control of major road leading to sievierodonetsk and lysychansk the situation there is difficult acute president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said of kreminna and other area in eastern ukraine in his nightly address late monday the occupier are using all the resource available to them and these are significant resource to squeeze out at least some advance serhiy haidai the ukrainian regional governor of luhansk province said on monday that in response to military pressure part of the russian command in kreminna had withdrawn to the town of rubizhne a few mile to the southeast although it wa not possible to verify the claim the russian understand that if they lose kreminna their entire line of defense will fall he said in a telegram post on tuesday vitaly kiselyov a russian backed official in occupied luhansk said on russian state television on monday that the situation around kreminna and another small city nearby svatove remained very tense the ukrainian counterattack in the east come a the country s battered economy show new sign of the war s toll leaving it ever more dependent on western aid the ukrainian government ha struggled to raise money on bond market

economy is projected to shrink about percent this year a russia occupies about a fifth of it territory hammer it city with cruise missile and batter critical industry like steel manufacturing and agriculture all of that ha left ukrainian public finance which ha been wobbly at the best of time during three decade of independence deeply reliant on assistance from the united state the european union european country that donate individually and other donor the international monetary fund which bailed out ukraine through a long run of post independence financial crisis ha not continued large scale lending during the war if the i m f is worried about debt sustainability and ability to finance imagine what private investor are thinking said tymofiy mylovanov a former economy minister who is a professor at the kyiv school of economics russia s economy ha also suffered over the month of war though it ha not collapsed under the pressure of punishing western sanction this week russian and ukrainian leader again suggested that they were open to peace talk but only on term that were dismissed by their counterpart ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba said that his government wanted a peace summit mediated by the united nation but that russia could not be invited until it faced war crime prosecution mr putin said he wa willing to negotiate but day earlier he restated a determination to keep fighting and he ha insisted that land captured by his force must remain russian forever on tuesday mr putin showed no sign that he expected the war or acrimonious relation with the west to soon abate he met with the president of belarus raising concern that he would use that nation again to launch an attack on ukraine and he signed a long expected decree that banned sale of oil to nation that imposed a price cap on russian oil the european union and it member the united state britain japan canada and australia in the absence of diplomacy ukraine and russia s military have been struggling against each other and muddy winter weather to seize more ground and entrench what they hold ukraine s campaign to recapture kreminna began in the fall a it force finished sweeping through the country s northeastern kharkiv region and turned south to focus on luhansk which wa almost entirely under russian control since then the side have fought a series of battle and artillery duel over highway and village around kreminna and svatove russian force took over both place not long after their full scale invasion began and have severed pontoon bridge over a river and built layer of defensive line to shore up the front ukraine and russia are also locked in fighting hundred of mile to the southwest in the kherson region where ukrainian force pushed russian troop out of the capital city but the kremlin still control a large swath of territory a russian artillery strike damaged a kindergarten infrastructure and an emergency medical aid station on tuesday in kherson although no casualty were reported the regional governor yaroslav yanushevych said on telegram since he took overall command of russia s war effort in october gen sergei surovikin ha sought to rally russian force from their series of defeat this fall he pulled russian troop out of the city of kherson in an organized retreat and ha made effort to conserve russia s artillery supply and reconstitute unit analyst say after losing the city of kherson and suffering other setback in the region russia ha been regrouping and reinforcing it troop in northern luhansk for an offensive that would aim to extend it control in the region according to the institute for the study of war a washington based research group to that end the institute said russia is prioritizing mobilizing troop to defend kreminna and svatove over operation in other part of eastern ukraine the institute cited ukrainian military report of increased russian movement of troop military equipment and ammunition in the area it said however that russian success in the short term appeared unlikely given the difficult terrain and the very limited offensive capability of moscow s force after month of heavy loss though a draft in the fall provided russia with hundred of thousand of sorely needed troop artillery heavy warfare ha depleted it best trained unit and strained it supply ukraine also face serious supply problem analyst say especially a it western supporter themselves start to run through their stockpile ukrainian artillery use conservatively is probably around maybe round per month michael kofman the director of russian study at c n a a virginia research institute said last week on the war on the rock podcast that s a lot more than anybody make in the west right now so all of this ha been coming out of stock which is like going through your saving account he added that ukrainian leader were willing to say what it take to get the assistance they need for beating russian force back i don t blame them their war effort hinge on external material support that s basically it russia foreign minister sergei lavrov on tuesday said there will be no more joint project with the european union and said moscow will instead turn to like minded ally for future diplomatic partnership thank god the world is not just the european union for u and we have lot of friend and like minded nation elsewhere he told russia state owned medium outlet ta our proposal for the demilitarization and denazification of the territory controlled by the regime the elimination of threat to russia s security emanating from there including our new land are well known to the enemy he said citing moscow s top propagandist claim despite the foreign minister s threat russia ha made little advancement in ukraine and ha lost territory over the last few month the defense official noted that it dwindling supply of missile ha prompted it troop to increasingly lay mine along the front line in a defensive posture russian president vladimir putin told his force last week that it wa their duty to hold the territory they have occupied though crimea remains the only region fully occupied kherson zaporizhzhia and donetsk are not fully occupied caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news even under a thick coating of snow the graveyard for russian soldier killed in the ukraine

of her son whose remains arrived just shy of his th birthday she declined to provide her surname fearing retribution for speaking out many western opponent of russia s war in ukraine expected that mother like natalia would become the backbone of a surge of outrage against president vladimir v putin and evolve into a political force opposing him but month into the conflict that ha not happened on a large scale and certainly not in ryazan a city of half a million people known for it elite paratrooper unit natalia said that she thought the invasion should have been planned better in order to minimize loss but she expressed no anger at russia s leadership something had to be done she said referring to ukraine that kind of continued support ha been a crucial factor in mr putin s ability to avoid any significant domestic blowback to his war allowing him to double down on his commitment to pursuing his goal in ukraine despite a series of setback natalia wa alone in the cemetery on her

russian army while percent believe the country is going in the right direction all this will be settled and soon everything will be normal she added yet something quite out of the ordinary ha already

base near saratov and that three personnel were killed but by and large mr yurov said many people he knew had started calling for more attack on ukraine or more extreme measure against the west something that dismayed him he said he had been briefly detained twice once on feb the day the war started after the police caught him holding an antiwar poster and again on sep the day mr putin announced mobilization when he wa outside a stationery store preparing to buy a poster here supporting human right is considered extremism mr yurov said he wa keen to talk to foreign reporter because

fight she said and she herself would not object if he were called up i m happy to have a son like that she said how else could i feel about it of course i m nervous i m very worried but i m not going to talk him out of it she said she wa completely behind the war putin took the first step she said if he hadn t done it who know where we would be now ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba told the associated press on monday that ukraine want a peace summit within a two month time frame and called on un secretary general ant nio guterres to serve a mediator but kuleba said that while kyiv will try to win the war in it doe not believe that russia would take part in the summit ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy proposed a step peace formula when addressing the g in october which included a war tribunal to hold the kremlin accountable for war crime committed in ukraine increased defense aid from western ally wa also crucial in his plan to end the war though negotiation with russian president vladimir putin were out of the question what sort of peace summit can occur without russia russian first deputy permanent representative to the un dmitry polyansky said according to russian state owned news outlet ta polyansky called the proposal diplomacy and in turn said it wa very easy to imagine a summit without ukraine caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news when he first saw the ruined cathedral in the young writer george bataille hardly knew what he wa looking at he had come home to reims whose cathedral had been the site of french coronation for a thousand year a a boy he had stood in awe of the high gothic cathedral it massive rose window it imposing gallery of king now bataille wa discharged from a brief stint in the french army and trying to recognize a cathedral whose roof wa gone and whose nave wa choked with debris reims cathedral stood hard by the western front and amid the fathomless violence of world war i beyond the trench and away from the gas the repeated shelling of the cathedral became one of the elemental symbol of it barbarity french newspaper invoked reims a proof of german inhumanity german propaganda blamed france for bringing the destruction on itself in recent year i ve thought too often of reims s admonition a century old monument exploded in minute the present betraying the past when looking at the new cultural ruin of this century in afghanistan and iraq in syria in armenia in ethiopia now up close in ukraine corp themselves did not mirror death more than did a shattered church the young bataille first thought after seeing the ruin of reims cathedral he might a well have been writing about the monastery of the cave which ha stood for century in the eastern ukrainian town of sviatohirsk which endured airstrikes shelling and sniper fire this spring leaving marble statue shattered and wooden spire burned to the nail yet after that first shock amid the rubble of a century ago bataille made an observation about violence and culture that applies a much to sviatohirsk a to reims that rubble can serve a the soil of cultural rebirth faith and doubt went together for him and even the greatest abandonment had a fecundity that defied war one should not seek among her stone something belonging to the past and to death bataille came to believe in her awful silence flicker a light that transfigures her vision that light is hope every army attack people a few attack time a well over the past six month with my extraordinary and dogged colleague from the new york time s visual investigation team i ve been absorbed in the toll of cultural destruction brought on by russia s invasion of ukraine we identified building monument and other cultural site that the war ha partially or totally destroyed we paid closest attention to four in the donbas the industrial largely russian speaking region of eastern ukraine where a war ha been ongoing since the sviatohirsk monastery is the most famous and beautiful of them but we also investigated a soviet era cultural center a bilingual community library and a contemporary military commemoration all now lost they aim at the most important thing museum library the thing on which we build our authenticity said svitlana moiseeva a librarian we spoke to who had fled west from the donbas some of the cultural site we documented were destroyed with intent above all ukrainian monument which have been smashed or dismantled on camera in several russian occupied region targeting cultural site for destruction is a war crime per the hague convention of the united nation to which both russia and ukraine are party others appeared to be collateral damage most of ukraine s ravaged cultural site are like the shelled reims cathedral perhaps not directly targeted but destroyed with ruthless unconcern over the summer i d traveled to liberated town outside kyiv i walked through the wreckage of the ivankiv historical and local history museum which burned down to the stud and the house of culture in borodianka whose tattered theater had once hosted a thriving local art program the destruction is even more intense in the east of the country working with colleague to document it scale watching loop after loop of burning church and battered archive one matter became clear the damage to art and heritage wa the inevitable product of a russian invasion meant to extinguish a national culture president vladimir v putin of russia is prosecuting this war to inscribe ukraine into a russian world he make no secret of this we are one people mr putin wrote in his notorious essay that negated ukrainian nationhood and cast ukrainian art and literature a russian patrimony this june at an exhibition in moscow the russian president explicitly analogized his war to the th century imperial conquest of peter the great just this past sunday in a russian television interview he accused foreign adversary of aiming to tear apart russia the historical russia the point of invading ukraine mr putin reiterated wa to unite the russian people language religion historical memory these a much a territory are the war s contemporary battlefield against it appalling human cost it cultural toll may feel insignificant or luxurious but culture is in every way a front of this imperial war and the fate of more nation than one hang on it defense what sort of culture can blossom out of charred ground some will have a nationalist even propagandistic tenor which is no sin amid a war of aggression by the time i got to the house of culture in irpin in july the musical group kalush orchestra had already filmed it video for stefania which wa this year s eurovision song contest winner and ha become an unofficial war anthem in the crushed remains of it music hall ukraine though already ha an incredible generation of artist writer filmmaker and musician who came of age after the orange revolution and the maidan revolution writer like serhiy zhadan and yevgenia belorusets artist like mykola ridnyi and anna scherbyna who were already forging a new postcolonial ukrainian culture from the donbas s postindustrial landscape they are in the vanguard of what we must hope when this war end will be a new cultural settlement that succeeds the imperial violence of the past more than bataille this coming ukrainian generation ha kept me in mind of another author of humanity in extreme who lived in northern france after a global conflagration samuel beckett after spending world war ii aiding the french resistance went to work in a ruined town in normandy in a town called saint l whose parish church like reims cathedral before it had crumbled beneath the bomb beckett served there a a storekeeper and interpreter at a provisional hospital set up by the irish red cross and yet a beckett wrote in the wreckage provisional is not the term it wa in this universe become provisional it wa in that martyr city among hollowed house and numberless casualty where beckett s subtractive vision began to crystallize into a new art of bleak hope civilization seemed abandoned humanity appeared futureless yet somehow in a wiped out corner of normandy horror and sympathy fused into the existentialism of waiting for godot and later culminated in the black optimism of happy day in our century too forgive my romanticism but i really do believe it there will be a new generation ukrainian and not only to reinitiate our culture in the rubble of war they will discover in the martyred city of mariupol what beckett discovered in saint l a time honored conception of humanity in ruin and perhaps even an inkling of the term in which our condition is to be thought again a ukrainian drone attack on a military air base in southern russia killed three russian service member over the holiday weekend if russian thought that war won t touch them in their deep rear they were deeply wrong ukrainian air defense spokesman yuriy ihnat said of the attack according to a bloomberg report the russian defense ministry said monday that the three russian service member died a a result of falling wreckage after it force shot down the ukrainian drone while no aircraft were damaged in the attack the holiday attack on engels air base which is in russia s saratov region and is situated over mile from the country s border with ukraine is the second attack the air base ha seen in le than a month on dec a similar attack on the base damaged two tu bomber ukraine ha not officially claimed responsibility for either attack the reported attack come a the ukrainian military claimed sunday that russia fired over missile into ukrainian town on christmas day but did not release any report on damage or casualty in the attack the exchange between the two country come after ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy made a high profile trip to the u s to meet with president biden and address a joint meeting of congress last week when he appealed to american and western ally to continue support for his country s defense against russia s military invasion meanwhile russian president vladimir putin claimed sunday that moscow wa open to peace talk but accused ukraine and the west of not engaging the kremlin we are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solution but that is up to them we are not the one refusing to negotiate they are putin said during an interview on russian state television however the u s and ukraine have continued to deny russia ha shown any openness to talk with zelenskyy adviser mykhailo podolyak arguing sunday that putin wa attempting to side step responsibility for the death of ukraine s citizen in a christmas address to ukrainian zelenskyy boasted that ukrainian force had continued to hand putin defeat on the battlefield but warned resident to be ready for any scenario a the conflict drag on into pavel antov a sausage tycoon and local politician in russia ha been found dead the prominent millionaire reportedly fell from the window of the hotel in rayagada india he wa staying in according to russian medium one of his traveling companion vladimir budanov also died at the hotel on friday odisha police superintendent vivekananda sharma said that budanov died of a stroke and that antov wa depressed following his friend s death antov wa accused of criticizing russian president vladimir putin s ongoing invasion of ukraine in june after a russian missile assault hit the shevchenkivskyi district of kyiv resulting in civilian casualty it s extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror a message from antov s whatsapp read the millionaire later claimed not to have made the post and called it a frustrating misunderstanding antov wa the founder of a meat processing plant that catapulted him to immense wealth fox news peter aiken contributed to this report when i wrote in the spring that european and american did not yet know who they had contacted who they had chosen a an anti russian battering ram and that they would still pay from the gift that the eternally dissatisfied citizen of the independent country would send them i a did not think that it would happen with such accuracy and b that it would happen so quickly but the svidom self styler didn t disappoint here either former foreign minister of ukraine a well known russophobe volodymyr ohryzko proposed to teach the mind mind to those member of the u house of representative who did not appear at zelensky s speech in congress did not stand up to greet him or did not applaud during his speech and there were plenty of them especially among republican how exactly should they be punished ogryzko also came up with this it is necessary to bring them to poland transport them from there to kiev and give them to the vsushniki and from kiev our soldier would transport them by appropriate mean to a place where it is very hot and if they saw that every day six to ten thousand shell are fired at an average normal pace and on peak day it go to ten of thousand then they would understand where the money of american taxpayer go ogryzko said about his method of educating american parliamentarian and let them perhaps spend the night with our soldier in the dugout somewhere let them listen to the bullet whistle overhead how the shell explode it s really the best form of persuasion that s going on because it s one thing to sit kilometer away and think about where the money go and it s another thing to visit the front line and this it seems to me is what our respected embassy in america should do today ogryzko said in an interview with the kiev magazine novoye vremya a if he himself had not climbed out of the trench in the hottest part of the front for day and week for there is nothing for these congressman to live there in washington they re brazen you know they don t get up they don t bow to the floor they don t send chelobits when such a person come out to their podium and they don t even applaud what arrogance into the corner on the pea on your lap for the night but let kiev not wonder why congress in which the republican will have a majority after the new year will not burn with love for ukraine however congressman are so for a warm up former ambassador of ukraine to the united state valeriy chaly on the air of the kiev tv channel espresso charged a savory slap to biden himself literally running over the owner of the white house jake sullivan biden s national security adviser approx author should remove the barrier to joseph biden in order to provide atacms with missile kilometer at least and long range drone if that doesn t happen in the coming week i will consider joseph biden very dependent on the opinion of some limited number of people patriot is not enough for u let s give u atacms however nothing surprising most of the psychiatric hospital in ukraine were closed by the government and the fleeing patient with megalomania settled in the local foreign ministry well not an incubator for the production of moron there wa launched at the time of gaining independence and now there is a lot of performance or else we will write in sportloto created by pentagon technology the ukrainian monster this ugly homunculus began to gain independence and bite it frankenstein without joke foreign minister dmytro kuleba and this is no longer a surname but a diagnosis said that kiev is starting a procedure to exclude russia not even from the security council but from the un and the grandson of the same stepan koshkodava soply bandera and his namesake by the way announced that troop should be sent to moscow so that ukraine would become the winner and when the west fails to implement their wish they will complain about the united state and the european union somewhere else because it wa they who molded today s ukraine from what wa but except for the known non sinking component at that moment they had nothing at hand listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year russian force continued to wage war on ukraine over the holiday weekend with more than missile being launched into ukrainian town on christmas day according to ukraine s military according to russian news agency which cited the country s defense ministry three russian military personnel were killed monday by falling wreckage of a ukrainian drone that wa shot down a it wa on it way to attack a base in russia s saratov region russian president vladimir putin reiterated sunday that he wa open to negotiation and accused ukraine and it western ally of not engaging in talk the u s ha previously dismissed this stance from russia a posturing given the ongoing attack on ukraine we are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solution but that is up to them we are not the one refusing to negotiate they are putin said in an interview on rossiya state television an adviser to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy however responded on twitter by saying putin needed to acknowledge it wa russia that ha not been open to talk moscow launched it invasion into it eastern european neighbor on february and attack on ukraine s power station have left million without electricity zelenskyy said russia would attempt to make the final day of dark and difficult russia ha lost everything it could this year i know darkness will not prevent u from leading the occupier to new defeat but we have to be ready for any scenario he said in a christmas day address ukraine and russia traditionally celebrate christmas on january but some orthodox ukrainian decided to celebrate on december this year zelenskyy ukraine s prime minister and other official in the country issued christmas wish on sunday ukraine s military said early on monday that russian force had shelled dozen of town in the prior hour on the luhansk donetsk kharkiv kherson and zaporizhzia region in the kherson direction the enemy continues artillery shelling of populated area along the right bank of the dnipro river the military said the ukrainian military also

contact and that it had destroyed numerous piece of ukrainian military equipment the kremlin vowed to fight until all it territorial goal are reached but ukraine say it will keep fighting until every russian soldier is forced from the country reuters contributed to this report ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba said monday that his country want to hold a peace summit at the united nation by the end of february but that russia should first face a war crime tribunal in an international court every war end in a diplomatic way every war end a a result of the action taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table kuleba told the associated press on monday united nation secretary general ant nio guterres could serve a the mediator at a potential peace summit kuleba said kuleba said monday that russia can only be invited to this step in this way referring to a war crime tribunal we are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solution but that is up to them we are not the one refusing to negotiate they are putin said in the interview zelenskyy tweeted on monday that he discussed the peace formula with indian prime minister narendra modi who ha sought to establish a stronger partnership with russia in recent month the associated press contributed to this report kyiv ukraine ukraine launched a drone attack at an air base deep within russian territory killing three serviceman the kremlin said on monday a kyiv s force demonstrated that they are increasingly willing and able to take the fight to russia and at longer range than ever before it wa the third such strike this month reflecting the assessment by ukraine s political and military leader that there wa little risk of moscow s escalating it war in retaliation despite it threat of dire consequence for attack against russia the russian military is already fighting at the limit of it conventional capability ukrainian say and the kremlin s hint of using nuclear weapon ring hollow the russian military in a statement cited by the state run ta news agency said that it had shot down a ukrainian drone on monday a it approached the engels air base about mile from the ukrainian border it said that the falling wreckage had caused the casualty and that no aircraft had been damaged assertion that could not be confirmed engels home to some of russia s nuclear capable strategic bomber that are used to fire cruise missile at ukraine wa one of two air base targeted by ukrainian drone on dec in the month after russia invaded on feb ukraine s ally voiced concern about attack on russian soil and the risk of retaliatory escalation which the kremlin and state controlled medium have threatened repeatedly the united state and others still refuse to supply ukraine with long range weapon and insist that the weapon they provide not be used to fire into russia but the fear of escalation ha abated there were many many red line stated by russia regarding further escalation serhiy hrabskiy a retired colonel and commentator on the war for ukrainian news medium said in an interview despite warning of dire consequence there is no reaction mr hrabskiy said why because the russian simply do not have capacity to do so ukraine ha struck repeatedly at military target in crimea and other russian occupied territory that moscow now claim a it own and at infrastructure like the kerch strait bridge linking crimea to russia and now it is stepping up attack into russia itself ukraine maintains a policy of not publicly claiming or denying responsibility for attack in russia even a official comment approvingly on them col yuriy ihnat a spokesman for the ukrainian air force said on television that the latest attack wa a consequence of what russia is doing in ukraine the ukrainian attack have been pinprick compared to the widespread devastation russia ha wrought against ukraine but the strike have boosted ukrainian morale damaged some russian warplane and infrastructure and pierced the air of normalcy the kremlin ha tried to maintain for most of it people if the russian thought that no one at home would be affected by the war then they were deeply mistaken colonel ihnat said he added that explosion at russian airfield complicated the bombing campaign against ukraine forcing moscow to relocate some of it aircraft though no one is claiming that the strike have seriously impeded the russian barrage the dec attack were carried out using a soviet era jet powered surveillance drone modified to function a an offensive weapon according to russian and ukrainian official shortly after a state owned ukrainian contractor said it had developed an attack drone with a range of over mile more than enough to reach moscow the u s reaction to the dec assault wa muted defense secretary lloyd j austin iii said we are not working to prevent ukraine from developing their own capability ned price the state department spokesman stated only that the united state wa neither encouraging nor enabling attack on russia both the state and defense department declined to comment on the reported drone strike on monday the attack have further infuriated pro war russian commentator who have railed about their country s exposed vulnerability they had already expressed anger over the russian military s poor combat performance not only have russian air defense failed to stop at least some of the strike but ukrainian official have also said that some were enabled by ukrainian partisan or special force operating behind the line ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba told the associated press on monday that his government wanted to hold a peace summit hopefully mediated by the united nation secretary general ant nio guterres by late february but that russia could not be invited unless it first faced prosecution for war crime it wa the latest in a string of claim by each country to be open to peace talk but only on term that are unacceptable to the other in the past three month russia ha launched wave of missile and drone at ukraine sending a many a at a time in a bid to overwhelm air defense they have targeted civilian infrastructure like the electrical grid and heating plant pitching million of people at a time into the cold and dark amid dangerous winter weather russian official who originally denied such strike have since insisted that the target had military value and have cast the attack a retaliatory president vladimir v putin ha cited the kerch bridge bombing a the motive though the concentrated strike on ukraine s power grid began earlier ukraine and it ally have dismissed that a nonsense noting that russia ha not hesitated to kill wound or terrorize civilian since it began it invasion and would be doing so no matter how ukraine responded the concentrated infrastructure attack they say are a reaction to the battlefield setback of the russian military an illegal attempt to force kyiv to capitulate by imposing maximum suffering on civilian president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine who received a hero s welcome in washington last week warned in his nightly video address late sunday that russia could intensify it barrage to cause blackout for much of the country before the new year s eve holiday we must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for u he said military analyst say that russia may be running low on the cruise missile and tactical ballistic missile it ha used against ukraine in an interview published on monday kyrylo budanov ukraine s director of military intelligence told liga net a ukrainian news outlet that the kremlin had enough for only two or three more big wave of attack they will run out mr budanov said russia ha increasingly resorted to using iranian bought drone which are much cheaper than missile but they are also much slower and easier to shoot down and carry le powerful warhead ukrainian and western official have warned that russia could also buy iranian ballistic missile extending the life of it bombing campaign the most sophisticated missile in russia s arsenal is the kinzhal which mr putin ha boasted of a a new superweapon and ha used a few time against ukraine like a cruise missile or drone it can maneuver evasively in flight and like a ballistic missile it is hypersonic traveling many time the speed of sound president biden ha described it a almost impossible to stop but russia began it invasion with kinzhals in it arsenal mr budanov said and ha manufactured only a few more during the war you can scare the world with the fact that you have a kinzhal he said but when you start to really use them what s next china sent a record number of military aircraft to menace taiwan on sunday and into monday morning a signal that beijing want to maintain pressure on taiwan even a some tension between china and the u s are easing according to taiwan the military activity included at least aircraft made up of chinese fighter jet maritime patrol plane and drone taiwan say that of those aircraft crossed the so called median line in a provocative breach of an informal boundary between the two side the large show of force came

com more than year ago when the nord stream gas pipeline between russia and germany wa little more than an idea a swedish government study warned of the risk inherent in running a critical piece of energy infrastructure along the baltic sea floor the pipeline would be vulnerable to even the most rudimentary form of sabotage analyst wrote and underwater surveillance would be nearly impossible the study written by the swedish defense research agency even posited a scenario one diver would be enough to set an explosive device today european investigator face almost exactly that scenario the swedish authority leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor wa most likely responsible for a september blast that ripped through the gas pipe official and expert say that explosive were probably dropped from ship or just a the swedish report warned planted on the seafloor using submarine or diver the nord stream attack ha been a wartime mystery prompting finger pointing and speculation about how in an era of constant satellite surveillance in the midst of an energy crisis and with europe on alert because of the war in ukraine a vessel could creep up on a crucial energy conduit plant a bomb and leave without a trace the baltic sea it turn out wa a nearly ideal crime scene it floor is latticed with telecommunication cable and pipe that a had been warned are not closely monitored ship come and go constantly from the nine country bordering the sea and vessel can easily hide by turning off their tracking transponder the key question is not what kind of surveillance there wa but why the lack of surveillance for this pipeline and other pipeline and electric cable and the underwater cable on the seabed said niklas rossbach deputy research director at the swedish defense research agency the baltic is also a giant graveyard for unexploded munition and chemical weapon dumped after the world war expedition to clear those obstacle are common meaning the expertise to carry out underwater detonation is ubiquitous several country along the baltic including russia have dive team that specialize in seabed operation official in the region said russia with a port along the baltic ha small quiet submarine that can move undetected according to former military and intelligence official in the region after the blast poland and ukraine openly blamed russia but provided no evidence in an interview daniel stenling sweden s top counterintelligence official declined to speculate on a perpetrator but he placed the nord stream attack squarely in the context of increasingly brazen russian espionage in the big context of the war in ukraine that is ongoing it s very interesting and very serious he said of the blast repeatedly emphasizing growing threat from russian spycraft and cyberattacks we have seen increased act from russia for a long time now he said russia for it part ha blamed britain also without evidence russia ha a history of using energy to exert influence and ha an interest in fracturing alliance within europe but the theory that russia carried out the blast repeated often by western official ha only gotten more complicated in recent week nord stream ag which is majority owned by a kremlin controlled company ha begun pricing out the cost to repair the pipe and restore gas flow according to a person briefed on the work who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wa not authorized to speak about it publicly one repair estimate start at about million the person said consultant for russia are also studying how long the damaged pipe can withstand saltwater exposure the inquiry raise the question of why if russia bombed it own pipeline it would begin the expensive work of repairing them but like any good mystery story the sabotage ha layer of intrigue and multiple player with degree of motive and ability even the decision by the swedish government to keep detail of it inquiry secret from western ally ha prompted whispered speculation that perhaps investigator have cracked the case and are strategically keeping quiet not so mr stenling said we have no concrete evidence he said but hopefully we will a for his government s choice to keep it card close mr stenling said the entire investigation is unusual nord stream encompasses two project each a pair of concrete encased steel pipe nearly four foot in diameter and more than mile long the first pair nord stream i came online in germany wanted cheap reliable gas and russia wanted to reduce it reliance on piping gas through ukraine a country with which it had a contentious relationship long before this year s invasion just about everyone else in europe along with the united state objected a senior polish official even compared the pipeline deal to the pre world war ii pact between hitler and stalin that carved up poland sweden objected to part of the project that wa planned near it coastline arguing that it could enable russian surveillance but the biggest argument wa that nord stream would make europe too reliant on russian gas giving moscow a lever over the european union with it ability to turn off supply soon after nord stream i went online the kremlin started pushing for another set of pipe this second pipeline known a nord stream ii ha been even more contentious with most of the european union and the united state under both president barack obama and president donald j trump opposing it construction finished last september and a russian soldier gathered on the border with ukraine ukrainian official saw the pipeline a a security threat if russian gas supplier could further bypass ukraine the argument went the kremlin would have no reason not to bomb ukrainian infrastructure last year ukrainian energy regulator sent a page letter to poland a part of a coordinated effort to stop the new pipeline from coming online nord stream ii will negatively impact on ukraine s national security read the letter which wa obtained by the new york time the letter also warned of economic consequence for ukraine since russian company still pay to send gas through ukrainian pipe even after russia invaded a ukrainian government document obtained by the time show that ukraine expected to continue charging russian company including state owned gazprom and rosneft to transmit gas during the first half of under it contract ukraine receives an average of billion a year in transit fee so the pipeline had no shortage of adversary but sabotaging a key piece of energy infrastructure could be considered an act of war for a european union or nato member to carry it out would have significant consequence shattering trust in two of the most important western partnership and while attacking the pipeline may have made financial sense for ukraine particularly in a time of war it capability to pull off such a feat is unclear ukraine doe not have a baltic port and it only known submarine wa captured by russia in many european government and expert see moscow a the most likely saboteur president vladimir v putin of russia ha used gas a a political lever in the past and there is evidence that he saw europe a vulnerable in one gazprom meeting an executive dismissed the idea that europe could leave nord stream ii closed wait for one cold winter and they will beg for our gas one official told colleague at a meeting with russian policymakers and business executive last year according to an attendee the attendee spoke on condition of anonymity because he wa not authorized to discus the meeting but germany blocked nord stream ii s launch a european country stockpiled natural gas this year the kremlin s behavior changed russia took nord stream i offline in late august blaming mechanical issue in early september the kremlin said that the pipeline would be shut indefinitely the explosion came a few week later on sept they severed both strand of nord stream i and one of the nord stream ii pipe the explosion doe not neatly benefit russia it must keep paying transit fee to ukraine it cannot easily use the promise of cheap gas to cleave germany from it european ally and it face hefty repair cost but the sabotage all but guarantee that gas price will be uncomfortably high for european until spring and it creates an incentive for e u country to push ukraine to negotiate a quick ending since the war threatens the land based pipe that bring gas west the fact that one of the nord stream ii pipe remains intact also mean that in an energy crunch germany could reverse course and allow that pipe to start pumping gas sabotaging nord stream also creates uncertainty about what other infrastructure could be attacked in addition to damaging the pipeline the explosion came perilously close to damaging a cable carrying electricity from sweden to poland you are sending a signal said martin kragh deputy director of the stockholm center for eastern european study at the nonprofit swedish institute of international affair it s signaling we can do this and we can do this elsewhere the fact that the pipeline wa not carrying gas at the time of the explosion ha contributed to that speculation we are le certain that the primary aim wa functional damage here because the nord stream gas pipeline wa not operational at the time said kjell engelbrekt who teach political science at the swedish defense university the lack of gas at the time of the explosion also cast serious doubt on a theory that a bomb wa sent through the pipe using an inspection device known a a pig or pipeline inspection gauge nonsense said stephan harmsen who designed the pig for nord stream i those device require gas flow to operate he said swedish investigator have recovered explosive residue from the blast site but they have found the baltic a difficult environment undersea photo showed little surveillance of such an enormous pipeline would have been incredibly expensive and wa never a priority for european intelligence agency the best undersea surveillance in the area security expert say is by russian sonar sensor along the pipeline western investigator have no access to that data with scant evidence from the seabed a breakthrough may rely on intelligence service wiretap and human source but so far american and european intelligence agency have not publicly shared any data that they might have collected it s very fascinating but it s very complex mr engelbrekt said and it s very difficult without access to some of these data point to start eliminating actor and motif pope francis spoke out against the ongoing war between russia and ukraine during remark on christmas calling for an end to the conflict speaking at st peter s basilica at the vatican the pope focused on the human toll that ha resulted from the war which ha been raging since february may the lord inspire u to offer concrete gesture of solidarity to assist all those who are suffering and may he enlighten the mind of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapon and put an immediate end to this senseless war the pope said according to agence france presse the pope s twitter account posted a similar message on christmas day meanwhile the war raged on during the holiday weekend a a missile strike hit the ukrainian city of kherson on christmas eve according to report the saturday morning attack killed at least eight and injured at least on friday the kherson region wa bombarded with separate strike that killed five civilian and injured others according to gov yaroslav yanushevych kherson wa liberated by ukrainian force earlier this winter making it a major target of ongoing russian attack aimed at retaking lost territory fox news timothy nerozzi contributed to this report pope francis used his christmas address from a balcony overlooking a crowded st peter s square on sunday to call for concrete gesture of solidarity with besieged ukrainian living through the holiday in the dark and cold far from their home due to the devastation caused by month of war lamenting that the icy wind of war continue to buffet humanity in an era scarred by a grave famine of peace francis meditated in his th urbi et orbi or to the city and to the world christmas blessing on the birth of jesus a a symbol of peace francis who turned last week and now switch between a wheelchair and a cane in public appearance urged the ten of thousand of faithful in the square to follow that road away from a world closed in on itself and oppressed by the dark shadow of enmity and war to a world that is open and free to live in fraternity and peace speaking specifically about the suffering in ukraine caused by russia s unprovoked invasion he called on god to enlighten the mind of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapon and put an immediate end to this senseless war he did not mention president vladimir v putin of russia by name francis now regularly speaks out against war but it ha taken him a long and fitful time to find his voice driven by hope of maintaining the vatican s traditional aversion to picking side in conflict to potentially play a role in an eventual brokering of peace a well a by an entrenched anti nato bias in some corner of the vatican francis ha studiously avoided naming mr putin or even russia itself a the aggressor only at the end of august amid questioning about whether the pope wa risking his moral authority did the vatican issue a statement saying the large scale war in ukraine wa initiated by the russian federation it insisted francis condemnation wa unequivocal earlier that month he had infuriated ukrainian by calling daria dugina a year old russian ultranationalist who spoke out in favor of the invasion of ukraine an innocent victim after she wa killed in a car bombing in september francis who incessantly criticizes the arm trade said it wa acceptable for country to provide weapon to ukraine so that the country could defend itself self defense in the face of aggression francis said at the time wa not only lawful but also an expression of love of country more recently he ha spoken about the battered ukrainian people but then in a november interview with the jesuit magazine america he said he had received much information about the cruelty of the troop in the war in ukraine but despite ample public information and investigation into the behavior of the russian troop including mass killing francis added a a rule the most cruel perhaps are those who are from russia but do not adhere to the russian tradition such a chechen buryats and so on many chechen are muslim buryats are a mongol ethnic group who traditionally follow buddhist and shamanic belief besides prompting perplexity in the west francis remark infuriated russia which demanded an apology from the vatican it diplomat reached out to moscow and apparently apologized this month francis appealed to the faithful to spend le money on their christmas gift and party and to send the saved money to ukrainian struggling through the frigid winter and in remark ushering in the holiday at a christmas eve mass before thousand of faithful packed in st peter s basilica francis lamented the consumerism that risked emptying the holiday of it meaning and blamed the sin of greed and the thirst for power for causing some leader to want to consume even their neighbor to avoid standing for too long on saturday francis delegated much of the celebrating of the ceremony to a cardinal on christmas day he stood with the help of a cane from the basilica balcony overlooking the square moving beyond ukraine on sunday he touched on other theater of this third world war around the globe let u think of syria still scarred by a conflict that ha receded into the background but ha not ended he said he mentioned the suffering of the people of haiti and the increasing violence in the holy land and he urged a divine intervention to rebuild mutual trust between israeli and palestinian he urged an end to the conflict and violence tearing apart the coexistence of people with different culture and tradition in northern africa prayed for a lasting truce in yemen and for reconciliation in myanmar and iran francis also noted how the war in ukraine had aggravated the risk of famine around the world especially in afghanistan and the country of the horn of africa and he argued that money that could go to feeding the hungry went to arming soldier we know that every war cause hunger and exploit food a a weapon hindering it distribution to people already suffering he said urging political leader to commit to making food solely an instrument of peace but he did not say which leader he wa referring to francis also emphasized past hallmark of his papacy including care for migrant and the destitute calling the world sick with indifference and unwelcoming to jesus a it is to many foreigner and the poor today may we not forget the many displaced person and refugee who knock at our door in search of some comfort warmth and food he said let u not forget the marginalized those living alone the orphan and the elderly who risk being set aside kyiv ukraine president vladimir v putin insisted on sunday that he wa willing to negotiate over his invasion of ukraine an oft repeated line that u s and ukrainian official have dismissed a lip service a air raid siren sent ukrainian already on edge from month of war and bitter cold to seek shelter on christmas day one nationwide alert in the morning and a second in the afternoon were lifted within about two hour and there were no immediate report of russian strike landing in ukraine but the air raid warning added to the anxiety of the country s first christmas since russia s invasion after day of warning from official that mr putin s force would unleash a new wave of strike targeting energy infrastructure a ukrainian marked the holiday with resilience gathering despite the siren in church and chapel for christmas service mr putin repeated the claim that his war wa in defense of russia s national interest and that ukraine and it ally were to blame for a conflict that ha entered it th month we are ready to negotiate with all the participant in this process about some acceptable outcome but this is their business it s not we who refuse negotiation but they mr putin told an interviewer on state television in russia top russian official have frequently said that they are prepared to enter negotiation mr putin said last week that his goal wa to end this war while emphasizing almost in the same breath a determination to keep fighting u s official have said that russia ha offered no indication that it is prepared to negotiate in good faith on sunday ukrainian appeared determined to celebrate a ordinary a holiday a possible nobody canceled birthday and nobody canceled christmas said oleh moor a cook in kyiv you cannot tell a child wait until the war is over maybe there is no music maybe there are no concert like last year but we continue living because of russian strike on infrastructure the ukrainian capital is mostly devoid of holiday light and decoration but the authority did set up a generator powered christmas tree on a central square that ha continued to shine even during the frequent blackout on sunday mr moor and his family were passing it on their way to christmas dinner his child posed for photograph with a santa claus we won t let the enemy know we are broken mr moor said there have been no serious peace talk between russia and ukraine in month and ukrainian official have said that they will not negotiate until moscow withdraws it troop on sunday ukrainian official were quick to dismiss mr putin s remark with mykhailo podolyak a senior presidential adviser saying that the russian leader need to come back to reality russia doesn t want negotiation but try to avoid responsibility mr podolyak wrote on twitter through the fall and start of winter russian force have fired volley of cruise missile and launched drone at ukrainian city aimed at energy and heating infrastructure military analyst have said it is part of a russian strategy of plunging the country into darkness and cold to demoralize the population the bombardment have typically come at interval of about a week the action on sunday that touched off the air alert could have been either russia firing missile or sending plane that set off false alarm but the air raid alarm are disruptive even when sounded a a precaution and no actual strike follow during the alert ukrainian often move to corridor bathroom or other area in their home that are away from window and deemed safer in case of a strike some people go to basement or quickly bundle their child into warm clothing to seek shelter in a subway station ukrainian in the capital have also pinned their hope on the country s air defense but in town closer to the front line no defense can shield against artillery fire ukraine s defense minister oleksiy reznikov said in a post on twitter on sunday that artillery had destroyed the only church in the village of kyselivka in the kherson region in southern ukraine one ripple effect of the war ha been a shift in view of when christmas should be celebrated with more orthodox ukrainian now saying they want to do so on dec in line with most of europe rather than on the eastern orthodox liturgical calendar date of jan over the past year support for celebrating christmas in december ha risen sharply a social survey by rating group a polling agency showed percent of ukrainian want to celebrate in december up from percent of those polled last year on sunday churchgoer crowded the small chapel of the st sophia cathedral in kyiv one of the capital s oldest church for a christmas service bundled up from the cold they continued their prayer unmoved even a the morning s air raid alarm sounded in rome pope francis appealed for peace in ukraine during his christmas address from the balcony of st peter s basilica asking god to enlighten the mind of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapon and put an immediate end to this senseless war the pope s plea came a day after russian shelling ripped through the center of the southern city of kherson killing at least people and prompting president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine to say that the holiday have a bitter aftertaste for u this year dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm there may be empty chair around it he said in a christmas eve message and our house and street can t be so bright and christmas bell can ring not so loudly and inspiringly through air raid siren or even worse gunshot and explosion those sentiment were evident in kyiv where friend and relative of ukrainian prisoner of war gathered on christmas eve and staged a performance called christmas in captivity recreating the image of the last supper that included barbed wire and empty steel bowl we have this opportunity to gather at the abundant ukrainian table thanks to our soldier who sacrifice their normal life to protect u said yevhen sukharnikov one of the organizer whose year old son is a prisoner of war they are being moved all the time and we are not provided with any way to contact them mr sukharnikov said the toll from month of war continued to climb the ukrainian military said on sunday that three demining expert had been killed in the kherson region a day earlier while clearing mine and unexploded ordnance left by the russian military which retreated from there last month a day after the deadly attack in the city of kherson a long line formed on sunday at a blood donation center photo shared by ukrainian official on social medium showed more than people were wounded in the strike which hit a shopping area and residential building in one of the deadliest russian attack on the city in the nearly two month since it wa reclaimed by ukrainian force people have gathered to help their fellow city resident injured by yesterday s russian terrorist attack ukraine s military tweeted anger invincibility compassion victory shelling in the recently recaptured ukrainian city of kherson killed at least people on saturday morning hour after president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine warned that another wave of russian strike could mar the christmas holiday with the approaching holiday season russian terrorist may become active again mr zelensky said in his overnight address therefore please heed the air raid signal help each other and always take care of each other his comment came after the ukrainian military warned on friday that russian ship carrying cruise missile had entered the black sea for the first time since dec when moscow fired a barrage of missile across ukraine the street of kherson were busy on saturday morning when russian force shelled the city center according to kyrylo tymoshenko deputy head of the president s office a shopping area and residential building place where the most people are were hit yaroslav yanushevych the head of kherson s military administration said in a statement in addition to the people killed people were wounded in the attack of whom were in serious condition he later told ukrainian television according to the ukrainska pravda news outlet two of the wounded were volunteer who had been distributing food aid when the shell hit according to matthew hollingworth the u n humanitarian coordinator for ukraine image posted by mr zelensky on his telegram account of the attack s aftermath showed several people and blood in the street a well a burning car he said that they showed the real life of ukraine and ukrainian in the morning on saturday on the eve of christmas in the central part of the city mr zelensky wrote these are not military facility this is not a war according to the rule defined it is terror it is killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure ukraine celebrates christmas a a national holiday on dec in line with the western calendar a well a on jan for church observing the eastern orthodox religious holiday the attack on saturday wa only the latest in kherson which ha been battered by russian shelling since ukrainian force retook the city last month on friday five people in the region were killed and others were wounded mr tymoshenkso said in an update before the most recent shelling the christmas eve bombardment though exactly month after russia invaded ukraine on feb prompted a rush of anger while family in europe north america and beyond prepare festive dinner spare a thought for ukraine the ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba wrote on twitter alongside image of the aftermath the ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov said that the barbaric shelling wa russia s revenge on kherson resident who had resisted the occupation while bridget brink the u s ambassador to ukraine condemned the brutal strike on a city whose citizen had already suffered so much when retreating russian force cut off power and water to kherson on their way out truly horrific especially on christmas eve she tweeted russia s war in ukraine is now fought in two largely separate arena ground battle in the south and east and air contest between ukraine s defense system and russia s cruise missile and drone aimed at electrical infrastructure military analyst say the infrastructure targeting campaign is intended to demoralize ukrainian and push their government into a cease fire that might allow russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensive since october russia ha fired volley of missile and drone at ukraine s energy infrastructure in interval of roughly a week to day according to ukraine s military intelligence chief most barrage have included around missile that tempo is likely set based on russia s weapon supply britain s defense intelligence agency said on saturday russia ha likely limited it long range missile strike against ukrainian infrastructure to around once a week due to the limited availability of cruise missile the agency said in it daily update similarly russia is unlikely to have increased it stockpile of artillery munition enough to enable large scale offensive operation for week ukrainian official have expressed concern that russian force could use neighboring belarus a a launchpad for a new ground offensive with kyiv ukraine s capital a potential target a rare visit by president vladimir v putin this week to belarus to meet with his closest regional ally president aleksandr g lukashenko amplified those concern mr lukashenko in turn traveled to russia on saturday state medium reported but the director of ukraine s military intelligence agency said in an interview with the new york time on friday that while the possibility could not be entirely ruled out a recent flurry of russian military activity in belarus wa an attempt by moscow to trick ukraine into diverting soldier from the active front line in the southeast of the country the institute for the study of war a washington based research group also said in it latest report that there wa no evidence that russia wa preparing a strike force in belarus and that a renewed invasion from the country wa unlikely this winter russian force have been much more clearly setting condition for an offensive in the northwestern part of the luhansk region the institute said citing increased transport of russian military equipment and personnel to the area a ukrainian official warned of further strike the country wa still grappling with the devastation caused by the most recent barrage of missile ukrenergo the national electric utility said on saturday in a facebook post that significant electricity shortage persisted with the kyiv region experiencing the greatest difficulty a a result of russian attack on dec those strike hit a critical piece of infrastructure and ukraine s utility have been instituting longer and more unpredictable power outage to keep the grid stable ukrainian have grown increasingly frustrated by the week of power outage and month of hardship a freezing weather set in but they have also adapted in kyiv stationary bike were powering the light on some christmas tree amid the rolling blackout an american weapon first dropped by stealth bomber over kosovo in and then during combat in the post war will soon be used by ukrainian pilot flying russian made jet to kill russian soldier the weapon called the joint direct attack munition consists of a kit that turn a cheap unguided bomb into a highly accurate gps guided weapon it is usually referred to a jdam pronounced jay dam the biden administration announced this week that the weapon would be part of a new billion military aid package giving kyiv a precision guided bombing capability it ha never had when dropped from higher altitude the bomb can travel about mile to it target before exploding with the right kind of equipment ukrainian jet could potentially carry multiple jdam on a single mission just like u s and nato warplane do technically speaking jdam refers to a kit that is bolted onto the u s military s general purpose mark series bomb and turn it into a gps guided weapon the mark warhead which wa developed soon after world war ii wa designed to be easily fitted with a variety of tail fin and fuze for use in a range of situation over decade different attachment have been fielded for low level bombing and to turn them into land and sea mine and finally into various type of guided weapon it typically come in three size ranging from to pound however which model or model will be provided to ukraine is unclear since their first combat use in the late s jdam have been improved and new capability have been added they can work with a variety of fuze that control whether they explode above the ground on the surface or after burrowing into the ground one updated kit add a pair of wing that open after the bomb is dropped allowing it to fly more than mile to a target they are also relatively inexpensive in the pentagon s math a navy fact sheet updated in put the basic jdam kit s average price at just over apiece jdam wa born out of the frustration that pilot and air force leader had with a different kind of guided bomb during operation desert storm in first used in small number toward the end of the vietnam war that bomb wa called the paveway ii at the time the idea wa considered revolutionary an expensive kit fixed to the nose and tail of a mark could make the otherwise unguided bomb maneuverable along the path of a laser shone from the ground or from a plane above but in iraq sandstorm and smoke often disrupted the path of the laser beam causing the bomb to miss it target month after that war ended the air force decided that military pilot needed a kit that would not cost more than paveway ii and could guide bomb in all weather condition a new constellation of gps satellite offered a solution continuously beaming radio signal that could guide bomb night and day rain or shine air force leader accelerated work on a similar device to produce what ultimately became jdam which are now made by boeing at a factory in st charles mo unlike some u s provided weapon the issue is not the length of training or the cost of maintenance a few fundamental hardware and software problem had to be solved jdam kit were not designed to be used with ukraine s russian made bomb and the country s russian warplane cannot carry american made bomb nor can russian flight computer communicate electronically with american guided munition since poland a former satellite of the soviet union joined the north atlantic treaty organization some of it russian mig warplane have been converted to carry western munition but that required replacing their soviet designed computer system and some wiring with western made gear a faster approach wa needed for ukraine the pentagon ha said little about how it made that work it took some macgyvering but the problem here wa not unlike the one shown in the movie apollo where nasa engineer had to fit different part together in order to save the life of astronaut in space figuring out how to put a square peg in a round hole a the story went in engineer had to essentially do that and much more to make jdam work on russian jet with the minimal modification the standard bomb used by the united state and russia are very different in design a are the device used to attach them to warplane and drop them over target american made bomb have two small steel lug that secure them to rack designed to hold them snugly at high speed and to quickly push them clear of the plane s fuselage when a pilot press a button to drop by comparison many russian bomb have only one suspension lug and the rack that drop them are incompatible with u s made weapon the u s military solved the hardest part of this problem month ago when ukrainian pilot first started shooting the american made high speed anti radiation missile or harm an adapter wa created to connect a device called a pylon and other part that hold the weapon to the jet at ramstein air base in germany a u s air force and air national guard team called grey wolf provides support to the ukrainian air force including on tactic and technique a military spokesman said yes quite a bit carrying the bomb securely is one thing but there are other problem the electrical signal generated when a pilot press the button to drop that bomb ha to be converted to one that american made device recognize and before being dropped a jdam need data on the aircraft s position and velocity a well a the target s location fed into it electronically while the plane is in flight newer type of american bomb rack and pylon offer solution one smart pylon used with the harm missile is now in service with ukraine s air force the final piece is to transfer data from the cockpit to the pylon once all other conversion and adapter have been figured out said mike pietrucha a retired air force colonel who spent decade flying a a weapon officer on f g and f e fighter more than a decade ago he said the u s military developed a system to adapt an american made gps aided weapon on a foreign aircraft using a laptop with a gps device that connected to the smart pylon via bluetooth today the same function could probably be accomplished using a tablet with a gps attachment and perhaps commercial flight software he added from there the pylon would transfer the data to the bomb itself boeing say on it website that it ha made more than jdam kit for the united state and allied country how many are headed to kyiv ha not been made public though it is likely that pound jdam will be provided to start with it mark a significant increase in ukraine s precision guided munition capability it s very important said andriy zagorodnyuk a former ukrainian defense minister who advises the government kyiv ukraine the director of ukraine s military intelligence agency said on friday that russia wa trying to convince ukraine to divert soldier from the combat zone in the southeast with a flurry of military activity to the north in belarus dismissing the activity a routine maneuver or feint intended to confuse these are all element of disinformation campaign he said in a wide ranging interview on the state of the war in ukraine the military intelligence chief kyrylo budanov also spoke about russian effort to encourage iran to continue to supply it force with drone and missile a well a moscow s apparently senseless obsession with conquering the city of bakhmut which ha little strategic value he made his assertion about russian activity in belarus and iran which could not be independently verified a ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky made a triumphant return from washington i am in my office mr zelensky said in a video posted to his channel on the telegram social medium app early friday we are working toward victory for week russia ha bolstered it military base in belarus with conscript and moved troop by rail to and fro raising concern that it might be planning a second invasion of ukraine from the north while the threat of a renewed russian invasion from ukraine s northern border with belarus is not imminent mr budanov said it still cannot be ruled out it would be wrong to discount this possibility he added but also wrong to say we have any data confirming it exists yet longer term risk linger mr budanov acknowledged and other ukrainian official had pointed out in a series of interview earlier this month the risk of an escalation during the winter month but mr budanov s comment were the most concrete yet in specifying that no intelligence now point to an imminent threat from belarus none of the russian troop are arrayed in assault formation he said training camp for russian soldier are filled with newly mobilized civilian who after completing training are sent to fight in the donbas region in eastern ukraine the training site lack sufficient armored vehicle in mechanically working order to stage an attack he said russia s military ha tried to raise alarm in the ukrainian army by loading soldier on train that chug toward belarus s border with ukraine he said the soviet union employed similar tactic during world war ii sending soldier on useless train ride to imitate attack or retreat in belarus one train loaded with russian soldier stopped recently for half a day near ukraine s border then returned with all the soldier aboard mr budanov said calling it a carousel similarly he said russia s cross border artillery shelling into the sumy and kharkiv region of northeastern ukraine which ha killed and wounded dozen of people is not a harbinger of an immediate threat of a repeat invasion russian military unit are not assembled for an attack and cannot be formed in one day in the southeast in the donbas region mr budanov said the political ambition of the leader of a russian mercenary army called the wagner group have partly dictated strategy on the russian side the group s founder yevgeny prigozhin a kremlin insider ha made a crusade of capturing the city of bakhmut to upstage rival commander in the russian regular army mr budanov said wagner coordinate with the army but is the primary force in the bakhmut front a russian general appointed in september a commander of russian force in ukraine sergei surovikin ha aligned with mr prigozhin in a rivalry with the russian minister of defense sergei k shoigu mr budanov said there is only an ideological and medium question here he said of the fierce assault on bakhmut that is a reason wagner unit are trying so fanatically to capture this town they need to show they are a force and they can do what the russian army could not we see that clearly and understand while capturing bakhmut is not considered strategically important it would improve russia s position in the east by opening road to other donbas city still under ukrainian control he said wagner operates unit of prisoner who are promised amnesty in exchange for a tour of duty on the front line video of the recruitment effort in prison show these infantry unit have been sent forward in costly human wave attack at ukrainian line mr budanov said the alliance of mr prigozhin and general surovikin ha led to the transfer of heavy weaponry from the army to the unit of wagner expanding the organization s role in the war mr budanov said wagner mercenary had earlier fought in syria and africa the group call itself a private military company russia s war in ukraine is now fought in two largely separate arena the ground battle in the south and east and a contest between ukraine s air defense system and russian cruise missile and drone aimed at electrical infrastructure since october russia ha fired volley of missile and drone at ukraine s energy infrastructure in interval of roughly a week to day mr budanov said with an average scale of about missile in each volley the drone have been supplied largely by iran and mr budanov said russia is also counting on tehran to replenish it missile arsenal to persuade iran to support this effort russia ha offered scientific know how to iran s military industry mr budanov said describing the geopolitical tie between russia and iran that ha emerged during the war in ukraine but it only go so far he said iran ha so far declined to support russia with transfer of ballistic missile a risk ukrainian official had raised alarm about previously iran is not hurrying to do this for understandable reason because a soon a russia fire the first missile the sanction pressure will grow on iran mr budanov said under a contract reached over the summer russia acquired so called shahed exploding drone from iran mr budanov said they are delivered in tranche so far russia ha fired about of the drone he said in tactical strike along the front line and in barrage aimed at power plant pylon for transmission line and electrical substation most of the small delta wing flying bomb are shot down before reaching their target but they are also cheap in iran mr budanov said the manufacturing cost is about per unit though it is unclear how much iran actually charged russia for the weapon kyiv ukraine president volodymyr zelensky s unannounced trip to washington on wednesday buoyed morale back home in ukraine where million have been plunged into darkness and cold from russian missile strike that have knocked out power a winter set in after week of a stalemate along much of the front some ukrainian said on thursday they had been cheered to see many member of congress chant during mr zelensky s appearance a day earlier the patriotic refrain glory to hero the high profile visit wa greeted in ukraine mostly with pride and hope that their president s impassioned in person appeal would keep american weapon and financial support flowing friend everything will be fine ukraine will be fine we will be given everything we will be helped valeriy tryhub a ski instructor wrote in a post on facebook reached by telephone later mr tryhub said that he had stayed up until a m to watch mr zelensky s address to a joint session of congress where the ukrainian leader received standing ovation and presented vice president kamala harris and speaker nancy pelosi with a ukrainian flag that had been signed by soldier this is without exaggeration an historical event he said of mr zelensky s first trip abroad since russia s invasion in february tetiana bisyk a writer said on twitter on thursday my whole life i never imagined the president of ukraine would be addressing congress and added i am so proud to be ukrainian in russia president vladimir v putin claimed he wanted the fighting to end and called on ukraine to negotiate sticking to the kremlin s propaganda script mr putin accused the united state of bringing war to ukraine back in by he said supporting the country s pro western revolution and ukrainian military action in the country s east in fact it wa russia that fueled and largely orchestrated a separatist conflict there our goal is not to spin this flywheel of a military conflict but on the contrary to end this war he said at a news conference on thursday we are striving for this and will continue to moscow ha accused ukraine of being unwilling to sit down for talk and mr putin did so again on thursday sooner or later of course any party in a state of conflict sit down and come to an agreement he said the faster this realization come to those who oppose u the better mr zelensky s visit to washington wa treated by russian commentator with derision a guy in a rumpled green sweater who is called president of an independent sovereign state flew in an american plane to an american air base said rodion miroshnik a pro kremlin analyst some russian commentator said that the way he had traveled to washington proved he wa an america stooge a petty demon came to see old satan declared vladimir solovyov host of the main political talk show on russia s state television network on thursday dmitri s peskov mr putin s spokesman also said a the kremlin ha argued before that the trip showcased the united state commitment to fighting russia to the last ukrainian the zelensky visit drew praise from two ally of ukraine s germany and france marie agnes strack zimmerman chairwoman of the defense committee in germany s parliament said on thursday it wa a relief to see that rivalry between republican and democrat had not undermined the united state backing of ukraine in the war it wa an incredibly important signal to all ukrainian fighting for their survival but also a very powerful gesture to europe that the united state is standing by europe she said in germany a spokesman for chancellor olaf scholz called mr zelensky s visit a hopeful sign though not a game changer in france the visit wa widely viewed a historic with mr zelensky described a having been welcomed like a hero it s a real show of force dominique de villepin france s foreign minister from to told france inter radio even amid the euphoria in ukraine some struck a note of caution mr zelensky wa returning home with at least one tangible gain an additional billion in military aid announced on wednesday that included a patriot missile battery one of the most advanced air defense system but passage in congress of an omnibus spending bill which includes nearly billion in additional funding for ukraine did not occur immediately on wednesday night because of an impasse over immigration policy and talk were still ongoing artur bilous a political analyst wrote on facebook that while no ukrainian president wa ever greeted like this in washington mr zelensky s trip would ultimately be gauged a success only if it helped speed up the flow of weaponry in particular how quickly military aid will be delivered first of all the patriot air defense system mr bilous wrote still it wa a mostly triumphant visit planned in stealth for mr zelensky a former comedic actor who wa elected in a landslide in but whose popularity wa slumping before russia invaded mr zelensky remained in kyiv even when the capital seemed about to fall early in the war and most ukrainian quickly set aside politics to rally around their president putin i hope you are watching this real time kira rudik a member of ukraine s parliament posted on twitter we will win at home mr zelensky s trip received heavy coverage in most news outlet offering a break from update on the electrical blackout in kyiv and fighting along the front the fact is that the ukrainian president ha turned into a symbol of democracy and courage for western voter evropeiska pravda an online news site reported the trip helped shore up bipartisan support for ukraine assistance in the united state the outlet suggested in a commentary voter all the more american voter love hero it said the moment is critical said mr tryhub the ski instructor we now more than ever need world support in the struggle for independence he said the united state is one of the many country that finally realized that without foreign support we cannot win so we need help especially since we have common value u b u bsuch a democracy and freedom on his way back from washington on thursday mr zelensky landed in poland where he said he met with president andrzej duda mr zelensky also recorded a video highlighting specific gain that grew out of the talk with the american including weapon ukraine will receive under the package of military aid announced in washington that package included patriot air defense missile which mr putin dismissed a outdated in his news conference on thursday but will come a welcome news for ukrainian regularly terrorized by wave of russian rocket attack targeting electrical infrastructure we are traveling with good result mr zelensky said these result will really help he noted the agreement on transferring patriot to ukraine and hinted at additional aid that had not yet been announced the ukrainian leader said he would speak of those other agreement later washington president volodymyr zelensky s triumphant visit to washington ended with promise of billion more in u s support for ukraine but not what he wanted most american battle tank fighter jet and long range precision missile the united state ha repeatedly said there are weapon it will not send to ukraine to battle russia s invading force but a the last month of war have shown the limit of u s support have shifted in ukraine s favor and mr zelensky may yet get what he want after his daring hour dash to the nation s capital on wednesday mr zelensky left with nearly billion in new arm and equipment a well a a likely commitment from congress for nearly billion in additional aid next year and while mr zelensky did not get everything on his wish list john kirby a national security council spokesman said on thursday that the united state wa committed to providing the equipment that ukraine need although he declined to provide specific any president any commander in chief in similar circumstance would want a much a you can get a fast a he can get it and we re committed to doing our part and helping in that regard mr kirby said he added though that mr biden and mr zelensky did not spend a majority of their meeting going over each of ukraine s request the discussion wa not driven by a list of additional capability there wa a much broader deeper discussion about the situation in ukraine and what the future portends he said rest assured there will be additional capability going into ukraine mr kirby said now what they are and how much of what they are that ha yet to be determined mr zelensky s trip wa a vivid demonstration of his strategy for wooing and pressuring ally he mixed appreciation for the aid provided by the united state with growing demand for weaponry knowing that he will not get all of what he want but believing the combination of his continued request and shift on the battlefield will lead washington to recalibrate it own assessment of what additional system ukraine can receive without risking a dangerous escalation with russia ukrainian official have broadcast their top battlefield request for month most recently in a tweet labeled my christmas wishlist from mykhailo podolyak an adviser to mr zelensky mr biden approved one item on that list a battery of patriot air defense on wednesday but the administration ha declined to offer or help provide the four others including battle tank and long range missile in a news conference on thursday president vladimir v putin played down the importance of the patriot saying russia would find a way to defeat it an antidote will always be found he said at the kremlin this is simply prolonging the conflict that s it in some respect the biden administration s acceptance of risk ha increased a the war ha gone on some weapon system that were off the table early in the war like the himars rocket artillery and the patriot missile defense system have since been approved and either are in the fight or on the way but some american official argue that it is the nature of the war that ha changed not the level of risk the white house will tolerate ukraine had a greater need for the himars system once the war became a battle of artillery and russian command post pulled back off the front line the biden administration decided to send the patriot battery when russia began launching sustained attack on ukraine s electrical infrastructure a winter set in both the himars and patriot system require trained team to operate them so there is a cost to ukraine to pull experienced soldier off the front line to learn how to use them and the united state ha only wanted to do that once they were sure the more sophisticated system could make a real difference the administration s current no go weapon fall into three basic category with some overlap administration official say the first group includes weapon like the long range missile called atacms with a range of some mile the administration fear that if ukraine get in a bad enough bind it could use the missile to strike target in russia prompting mr putin to widen the war when asked about the missile at a joint news conference with mr zelensky on wednesday mr biden cautioned that sending the arm could rupture nato unity in support of ukraine they re not looking to go to war with russia he said of the alliance they re not looking for a third world war some former american commander reject the administration s reason for holding back pivotal weapon at this crucial time in the war the administration continues to overestimate the risk of escalation and underestimate ukraine s cleverness and innovative way of fighting said frederick b hodges a retired lieutenant general and a former top u s army commander in europe a second category cover weapon like armed mq c gray eagle and mq reaper drone which proponent said would enable ukraine to attack a broader array of target or spot them for other ukrainian strike but pentagon official have expressed concern that if those drone are shot down or crash russia could recover them and exploit their advanced technology a third category cover weapon like the abrams battle tank and f fighter jet some of the most advanced weapon in america s arsenal pentagon official say ukraine already ha enough tank and fighter jet from other country more important the official say the system take month to learn how to use and require complex maintenance usually done by civilian contractor who might be unable to work safely in ukraine these are tough choice said representative jason crow a colorado democrat who serf on both the house intelligence and armed service committee he said he support sending ukraine the atacms and f s but not the battle tank senator christopher s murphy democrat of connecticut and a member of the foreign relation committee said ukraine need additional munition that the united state cannot easily provide we simply don t have the stock to supply nor do we make the munition that much of their equipment fire mr murphy said what ukraine need is enough firepower to show putin the limit of his power mr murphy said putin is never going to meaningfully come to the table unless he ha seen in real term where his power stop and so that mean you have to be perhaps willing to fund a stalemate for a period of time mr murphy also acknowledged the prospect that with a divided congress republican take control of the house next month while democrat will retain their majority in the senate aiding ukraine may soon prove even more difficult zelensky is always asking for the sky and that s perfectly appropriate and it s our job to make sure his job is nimble enough to meet the moment mr murphy said we also do have an obligation to the taxpayer to not waste money with each new request from ukraine for another advanced capability the united state ha tried to as how mr putin might react by looking at the kremlin s comment and at how russia ha responded in the past when the united state ha aided it ally and partner in europe one thing above all others ha influenced the debate within the administration over what weapon system to give ukraine russia s restraint in keeping the war contained russia ha steadily increased the brutality and breadth of it attack against ukraine killing civilian on the march to kyiv the capital deporting child from occupied area and now trying to break the will of the ukrainian by attacking the electrical infrastructure to plunge the country into cold and darkness but moscow so far ha not let it war spill over into nato territory american official continue to insist they have seen nothing that indicates russia ha decided to expand it attack beyond ukraine there have been no stepped up cyberattacks by russian intelligence agency on nato ally and no evidence that russia ha conducted any sabotage attack on allied country mr putin s unwillingness to fight nato directly ha been key to the alliance s ability to supply ukraine with a steady flow of arm and ammunition the very supply that have kept kyiv in the fight mr putin ha shown he will accept high level of international support for ukraine a long a those weapon are used in ukraine that u s official said is the critical calculus whether mr putin will see a weapon system a something meant to attack moscow or something meant to be used inside ukraine it is important these u s official say not to give mr putin an excuse to expand the war an eight month investigation by the time ha identified the russian military unit behind one of the worst atrocity of the war in ukraine the killing of dozen of civilian in the kyiv suburb of bucha a team of reporter spent month in bucha after russian force withdrew in late march interviewing resident collecting security camera footage and obtaining record from government source

the th air assault regiment based in the city of pskov in western russia and led by lt col artyom gorodilov the evidence show that the killing were intentional russian troop apparently killed the

s failure to crush ukraine one part appreciation for the american taxpayer funding the battle and one part sale pitch for keeping a fragile coalition together in the long bloody and freezing winter ahead but between the line were revealing hint of mr zelensky s worry about the year ahead for all the repeated talk of victory and the comparison of the current moment to the turning of world war ii at the battle of the bulge mr zelensky and his top military official doubt that the russian force that invaded in february can be vanquished anytime soon and the ukrainian president surely know his country s remarkable resilience in the first year of the war could be threatened in the second and the resolve of it savior could begin to waver a russian buildup of force ha many official wondering if a humiliated president vladimir v putin is plotting a new attack and for the first time there are hairline fracture but not crack among some ally and partner including a minority of republican who question whether america should be spending ten of billion for a nation that is not a treaty ally it wa up to mr zelensky to address all of that and make the case for more without actually reading out a shopping list he did so in a speech that wa carefully designed to appeal to many constituency one in which the ukrainian president came off a grateful and yet gently demanding more he want abrams tank and f fighter layered air defense and the patriot missile system that president biden announced would soon be on it way not surprisingly mr zelensky the performer turned politician turned medium savvy wartime leader focused his appearance to highlight good news russia ha been in retreat america ha provided ever more powerful weapon there is plenty of money for more and the western alliance is still intact ukraine is alive and kicking he told the joint session of congress appearing in a somewhat cleaned up version of his instantly recognizable drab green t shirt a modest concession to the formality of a speech from the podium of the chamber yet he acknowledged the sheer mass of the russian force now being reassembled a mr putin try to recover from surprise ukrainian victory such a those at kherson and kharkiv where russian occupying force were driven into retreat this fall american military commander worry that the russian conscript even if quickly and poorly trained will form a bigger enemy force than any thrown at ukraine yet after thanking congress for the weapon and ammunition it ha provided mr zelensky asked is it enough honestly not really a bit of nervous laughter swept through the house chamber he wa of course turning to the real reason for his visit from the start of the conflict mr zelensky seemed to intuit that he needed to be more than an inspiring leader he needed to be an arm importer coaxing out of the biden administration longer range weapon that could inflict on russia the kind of damage it ha wrought with fiery efficiency on ukrainian civilian critical infrastructure and by any measure he ha been successful gradually getting ever more powerful offensive and defensive weapon even a mr biden ha withheld the f s and abrams tank on wednesday evening mr zelensky tried to appeal to the minority of republican who are reluctant to spend more in a conflict whose end is nowhere in sight he raised the surprising new role of iran whose provision of drone helped bail out russian force who were running out of precision weapon it is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other ally mr zelensky said a clear reference to israel it wa a subtle way of saying that the war is not just ukraine s fight but part of washington s long standoff with a state sponsor of terror that is edging closer than ever to the capability if not necessarily the intent to build nuclear weapon with that one line he married ukraine s recent confrontation with iran over drone to washington s longstanding one over the iranian nuclear program part of his strategy of describing the war in his country a something bigger a battle over preserving democracy and the post cold war world order and he made clear without quite saying so that the biggest mistake now would be to give mr putin what the russian autocrat most desire time to let brutally low temperature extensive blackout water shortage and a campaign of terror from the sky break ukraine s will and fragment a surprisingly united europe russia is using winter a a weapon mr biden said at his news conference with mr zelensky at the white house on wednesday afternoon saying russia wa freezing people starving people cutting them off from one another the attack on ukraine s power grid and water supply have taken a grim toll sending stream of refugee fleeing the country again including ten of thousand who had returned to their home over the summer air defense have taken down a large percentage of the drone and missile fired at ukraine s city and infrastructure but the number of attack is so overwhelming that plenty get through there is little prospect that will change anytime soon it will take month to build the kind of layered defense needed to protect against the variety of attack launched by russia mr zelensky s aide meanwhile are publicly debating whether it is wiser to stay on the attack this winter or rest and regroup a similar debate is underway in moscow american intelligence official say andriy zagorodnyuk a former ukrainian defense minister who is now an adviser to the zelensky government said in an interview that mr putin plan new mobilization and another offensive in the first quarter of that make securing the right amount of military assistance for ukraine critical many american official disagree and think that mr putin is in no shape to risk another major military operation and while congress is expected to soon pa a billion package of additional arm and support for ukraine over the objection of a small but vocal group of republican the longer term question hovering over the discussion in washington is how to think about helping ukraine if the war stretch on for year a many senior official now say they expect mr putin they say may have given up his hope at least for the next few year of taking the entire country but they fully expect him to conduct a long grinding conflict in the south and east centered on the province he ha declared are part of russia mr putin himself got a bit of the last word on wednesday saying he would spend whatever it take and take whatever time is required to meet his goal clearly so will mr zelensky president of the united state joseph biden accurately and succinctly determined how the russian special operation should end for ukraine if kiev continues to conduct hostility to the last ukrainian at a press conference following a meeting with the head of ukraine vladimir zelensky the head of the white house promised to provide assistance to kiev until independence cease to exist we will stand on the side of ukraine a long a it exists biden said while refraining from predicting how many day week or month remained for this state however a few hour later these promise were broken the senate suddenly postponed the vote on a new aid package for billion perhaps washington ha already begun to count the remaining day for ukraine a the overseas sponsor praised the head of the independent country who arrived for a bow for openness to achieving a just peace without territorial concession naturally on absolutely unacceptable condition for russia that is in fact washington simultaneously pretend to seek peace but with the other hand give kiev the go ahead to escalate the conflict with moscow thus demonstrating to russia that it is possible to fulfill the goal of the special operation only after the complete overthrow of the puppet regime after all a long a ukraine exists under the rule of zelensky biden will support he promised so the real result of zelensky s meeting with the host wa confirmation from washington we are ready for any sacrifice from ukrainian indifferent to u in order to achieve strategic goal to support the dollar by saturating our military industry with money and to weaken russia a much a possible during the military conflict but will it work a more than eloquent answer wa the board of the ministry of defense with the participation of vladimir putin where the reform of the russian army wa announced and global change in the world order which threaten the hegemony of the united state also clearly do not play into the hand of the white house but the stake have already been made listen a well how will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year while much of the world celebrates christmas and ring in a new year ukrainian will be marking the passing the grim milestone of having reached the month mark in russia s invasion of ukraine koffler s comment come a russia s invasion of ukraine is set to hit the month mark and promise to spill over well into a sort of stalemate many analyst failed to see coming when russian force crossed the border and spilled into ukraine expectation of a swift victory were likely shared by russian president vladimir putin when he launched what he coined a special military operation in ukraine on feb a plan designed to bring a quick win that would usher in a new phase of russian dominance in the region putin expected to subdue ukraine within day maximum week force ukranian president volodymyr zelenskyy to capitulate or flee and install a new government that is pro russian or at minimum not pro western a new regime that would abandon plan to join nato koffler said however such a quick victory for putin ha failed to materialize setting the stage for a continuation of the war into a the world wait to see how the war unfolds in the new year here is a look back at some of the key moment of the conflict in a the world celebrated the calendar flipping to russia wa continuing it month long build up of force in ukraine by january military analyst in ukraine were estimating that russia had amassed a force of close to troop on the border having ended the year by pushing for a ban on ukraine joining nato a proposal that wa rejected by both ukraine and member of the alliance russian troop began spilling into allied belarus also on the border of ukraine to conduct military exercise the continued build up sparked international condemnation from the west with the u s sending million in security assistance to ukraine and president biden warning of consequence for russia in the event of an invasion russia will be held accountable if it invades biden said in a january press conference however russia s military buildup continued reaching nearly troop at ukraine s border a the eventual invasion neared russia accumulated over the course of approximately two month a build up of troop including military hardware logistics supply koffler said on feb putin announced russian recognition of two eastern ukrainian breakaway region in ukraine the donetsk people s republic and the luhansk people s republic the move brought the first round of nato sanction against russia and growing concern that an invasion of ukraine wa imminent undeterred by western threat putin launched his invasion of ukraine three day later and sent in many of his troop on a mission for the demilitarisation and denazification of ukraine within minute of putin s announced invasion explosion could be heard in major ukrainian city such a kyiv kharkiv and odessa report quickly circulated that russian troop had landed in the crucial coastal city of mariupol while observer closely followed large unit of russian force making a beeline for the capital heavy fighting broke out across the country and eventually spilled into kyiv while the russian air force continued it bombardment of major city and key infrastructure across the country many analyst expected the outmatched ukrainian military to quickly fold under the pressure but the country s resistance to the invasion proved more fierce than what had been predicted billion worth of western money and weapon continued to flow into ukraine giving their seemingly outmatched force a chance to fend off the offensive by april russian force in the north began a retreat and reorganization of force while ukraine maintained control of it capital having failed to quickly end the war russia reorganized it force and shifted it focus to the southern and eastern portion of ukraine ukrainian force were put on the defensive across multiple front a the russian secured key city and infrastructure and amassed heavy force with an eye towards maintaining an occupation of area in kherson and donbas heavy fighting continued in the east and south throughout the spring and deep into the summer while putin shifted gear toward targeting critical infrastructure in a bid to weaken the will of ukraine s civilian population moscow also launched strategic operation to defeat critical infrastructure of the adversary a war fighting doctrine developed on putin s order a decade ago a part of the plan to restore control over post soviet state which russia view a part or it strategic security perimeter putin s version of the monroe doctrine koffler said the cooperation in ukraine ha seemingly deepened tie between iran and russia with tehran going so far a to send military adviser to crimea to train russian force on the use of the uavs however bolstered by continued u s and allied security assistance ukraine showed little sign that it wa willing to give up on the region with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy vowing to retake the territory currently occupied by russian force including the long held crimean peninsula crimea is ukrainian and we will never give it up zelenskyy said during an august address zelenskyy showed he intended to make good on that promise by the end of august launching a ukrainian counteroffensive that suddenly put russian force on the defensive for the first time in month ukrainian force attacked long held russian position across the south and eastern region of ukraine with fierce flighting that eventually led to ukraine regaining control of large area it had lost in the month before zelenskyy mounted a blistering counter offensive in which ukrainian force recaptured approximately of the of ukraine s territory occupied by the russian koffler said the offensive also worked to reignite international support for ukraine ushering in a renewed round of security assistance to assist ukrainian force in maintaining the offensive he continued to galvanize the west to help his country defeat the russian occupier koffler said of the ukrainian leader the ukrainian had also once again dealt a large blow to putin s war plan forcing the russian leader to bring more new troop to the fight a heavy russian casualty mounted putin drafted an additional troop having invoked a partial mobilization the first since world war ii koffler said the offensive also forced putin to admit that the conflict could be a protracted one which would require the government to increase it funding for the effort meanwhile crippling international sanction proved to be an obstacle to russia s aim limiting putin s ability to resupply his force with gear and munition while applying pressure on him politically a zelenskyy made his historic trip to the white house to meet with biden this week the future of the war in ukraine remains a uncertain a ever while the ukrainian leader appealed for greater assistance the u s is seeking to balance it continued support with ukraine while attempting to avoid risking further escalation with putin zelenskyy s trip came a biden announced an additional billion in security assistance in ukraine which will for the first time will include patriot missile system kyiv ha long coveted it also come a congress appears poised to sign off on an additional billion in aid for ukraine a development koffler belief will make it hard for russia to achieve it war aim during zelenskyy s address to a joint meeting of congress wednesday the ukrainian leader stressed the importance of supporting ukraine now arguing that russia s aggression could eventually threaten nato ally or even the u s homeland he also pointed to russia s renewed partnership with iran warning the two terrorist country cooperation threatens the rest of the world however koffler noted that despite russia s view that ukraine is a critical buffer between itself and nato a path to victory for russia will also remain elusive koffler also expressed pessimism at the chance the side could reach a diplomatic solution to end the conflict arguing that the term of such a solution would likely be unacceptable to both side this is rapidly turning into afghanistan koffler said my assessment is that year from now there will still be fighting on the ground in ukraine even if some sort of a deal is brokered eventually which i see no chance of right now it will not bring ultimate peace because neither side trust the other the white house first disclosed tehran s plan to gift russia hundred of shahed drone earlier this year and by august iranian supplied drone had been shipped to russia but iran ha denied providing russia with drone despite claim from the u s state department that there is abundant evidence that russia is using iranian drone in ukraine iran ha repeatedly denied these claim report and comment made by top defense official suggest iran and russia are also expanding their defense partnership by helping the kremlin produce iranian drone within russian border if you had not taken the initiative the other side would have done so and initiated a war he said according to a statement from the iranian leader s office caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world

performer zelenskyy thanked congress and the american people for the invaluable assistance having expressed hope that his word of respect and gratitude resonate in each american heart he spoke accented but very comprehensible english using forceful language and a somber tone a he wa reading from his note frequently looking up to connect with his audience and sometimes placing his hand on his heart to express gratitude he periodically raised his voice and tapped the podium with his fist for emphasis he wore his signature olive color crew neck military style sweater cargo pant and heavy boot maintaining his image of a wartime president while putin doe seek to re establish control over post soviet state which moscow view a it security perimeter and it version of the u s monroe doctrine he ha no design on any nato country including the former soviet baltic state the claim by washington and kyiv politician that russia would attack a nato country which would trigger the collective defense clause is nonsensical the russian army is struggling to secure a clear military victory over a much smaller opponent having exhibited incredible tactical incompetence in this war how on earth would it go against a nato nation or even sweden or finland putin is not suicidal we learned in afghanistan that even for the taliban which lack a regular military it doesn t take much to

former biden official who wa recently arrested for stealing a suitcase at the harry reid international airport in la vega it s absurd how our elected official repeatedly subordinate our interest and

caldwell vice president of foreign policy for the group stand together tweeted zelenskyy made a direct appeal to republican hesitant to continue funding ukraine arguing that ukraine s independence is essential to global security not really in other word the return on our investment in ukraine will be more pitch for more investment in ukraine give me money so i can demand more money that s what zelenskyy promised u last night but unfortunately this is not one of those time the united state is flat out of money and not just in some abstract powerpoint presentation kind of way where we show you graph of the national debt and we all pretend to be shocked and horrified no no no the united state is broke in a real way meaning we can no longer afford to take care of our citizen how high is it well over the last three year since covid began the federal government spent about billion in extra medicaid payment to american that s a lot of money how much is it well it turn out that billion is roughly what congress ha sent to our fast talking ukrainian friend in the sweatshirt in le than a single year just for comparison just you would know what the priority are in washington your health care is just too expensive sorry and your border is too can t afford it but for the strongman who run ukraine no cost is too high volodymyr zelenskyy i assure you that ukrainian soldier can perfectly operate american tank and plane themselves thank you for both financial package you have already provided u with and the one you may be willing to decide on your money is not charity it s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way nbc news took off right after them that wa the headline for nbc it house historian michael beschloss declared this for any member of congress who refuse to clap for zelenskyy we need to know from them exactly why we need to know why thought crime alert you ve been reported a not applauding explain yourself pleb and then beschloss went on television to drive home the point our source have reported you are not clapping watch this why wouldn t you clap for a man who banned a christian denomination a man who arrested priest raided monastery seized church outlawed opposition medium outlet outlawed political party that opposed him threw his primary political opponent in jail why would you applaud for a man like that do you love putin are you opposed to democracy explain yourself that s what he s saying that s what they re all saying remember when joe biden told u about nord stream there were two story the first story wa joe biden promised to blow up nord stream the pipeline that brought natural gas from russia to western europe he s going to blow it up do you remember that you re not allowed to remember it but we remember it and we saved the tape here it is president joe biden if russia invades that mean tank or troop crossing the border of ukraine again then there will be no longer a nord stream tube we will bring an end to it reporter but how will you do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within germany s control joe biden we will i promise you we ll be able to do it foreign policy magazine which used to be a real magazine called any question about what happened to nord stream a kremlin talking point wow could it be they were lying oh yeah they were lying oh they were lying so if russia didn t do it then the people who suggested maybe the biden people were behind it were right so you d think in a free country in a democracy you would get to discus that in public but you can t and the press corp is not going to help you they don t ask question we don t have that anymore here s what we have john berman politician and the press often toss around comparison to winston churchill but this time minus the cigar and the whiskey it fit ana cabrera president biden face to face with the man who ha drawn comparison to winston churchill andrea mitchell and in a dramatic wartime appearance reminiscent of winston churchill in world war ii hillary clinton this wa historic some people have compared it to when churchill came jon meacham zelenskyy is very much acting in the churchillian tradition jonathan lemier what could be a churchillian moment john spencer i mean he is a modern winston churchill with an iphone sen jack reed someone who probably is the most courageous and inspirational leader since winston churchill sen chuck schumer where winston churchill stood generation ago so to president zelenskyy stand margaret hoover that s exactly what i m saying gen barry mccaffrey this is a historical figure this guy actually can be compared to winston churchill to lincoln in alright so this is clearly some sort of weird psychodrama that a ruling class is engaging in that give meaning to their otherwise barren life the problem is there are potential consequence that could end the world so the other day lindsey graham came out the republican from south carolina and said that he agreed with joe biden and zelenskyy the real goal is not to move russian troop out of ukraine back to pre february border the real goal is regime change in russia watch this lindsey graham how doe this war end when russia break and they take putin out anything short of that the war is going to continue to ask the ukrainian to give russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen to signal a cease fire russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again so we re in it to win it and the only way you re going to win it is to break the russian military and have somebody in russia take putin out take out putin putin s bad kill him fine what happens then well the world s largest landmass fall into ungovernable chaos and that country ha the world s largest nuclear arsenal what happens to all those weapon in a country with a lot of people who hate u lindsey graham ha no idea he doesn t care he s not interested he s not going to be here to find out and you know what they don t care about you your health care your southern border your child your school your country they don t

spending bill which includes more than billion in additional military and humanitarian aid for ukraine we must enable the ukrainian together with our nato ally and other western partner to hasten the moment where president putin recognizes that this is not sustainable either on the battlefield or on the home front petraeus said the extra billion in aid could carry ukraine s defense through the

a few lawmaker acknowledged that they had learned of the possible visit late tuesday but most lawmaker and aide appeared stunned by the news while multiple senior lawmaker including m pelosi and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the minority leader have made trip to ukraine mr zelensky ha not left since the war began he spoke to congress virtually earlier this year that president zelensky is going to make his first trip outside the country since the war began to speak to u to thank u and to challenge u to continue to support the ukrainian people i think is the perfect ending to two year where president biden ha had some landmark success said senator chris coon democrat of delaware who described mr biden s success rallying nato and european ally behind ukraine s fight a the biggest international achievement this year washington a the war in ukraine soon enters it second year ukrainian troop will find it much more challenging to reclaim territory from russian force who are focused on defending their remaining land gain rather than making a deeper push into the country american official say over the course of the first month of the war the ukrainian military ha with significant american support outmaneuvered an incompetent russian military fought it to a standstill and then retaken hundred of square mile and the only regional capital that russia had captured despite relentless russian attack on civilian power supply ukraine ha still kept up the momentum on the front line since september but the tide of the war is likely to change in the coming month a russia improves it defense and push more soldier to the front line making it more difficult for ukraine to retake the huge swath of territory it lost this year according to u s government assessment all of these factor make the most likely scenario going into the second year of the war a stalemate in which neither army can take much land despite intense fighting i do think that it is far easier for ukraine to defend territory than to go on the offensive to recapture territory said evelyn farkas a former senior pentagon official and russia expert we need to be providing ukrainian the necessary equipment and training to do that added dr farkas now executive director of the mccain institute president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine asked for such assistance when he met president biden and addressed congress on wednesday evening his first visit outside the country since the start of the war over the past six month ukrainian force have slowed russia s advance in the donbas in the east reclaimed a large swath of land in the northeast and gained control of kherson a major southern city but the win came with a heavy cost thousand of ukrainian soldier killed and the expenditure of immense amount of ammunition in particular artillery round in fact throughout much of the year ukraine fired far more round of artillery in a week than the united state could produce in a month though ukraine s military ha consistently outperformed the russian army senior ukrainian official have warned about the possibility of a major russian offensive but expert on the ukraine war say russia doe not have the force ready for any significant offensive in the next few month ukrainian official have said they plan to continue to press their counteroffensive against the russian the focus will be in the south where the ukrainian military and political leadership believe they need to make gain against russian force to restore critical ukrainian territory american official say ukraine will most likely avoid sending it army directly into crimea and will instead rely on more covert operation similar to the attack on the kerch strait bridge that knocked out a key russian supply line and airstrikes to attack russia s military position in crimea ukrainian official have told their american counterpart that it is critical to pin down russian force in crimea if they let up pressure there the ukrainian worry it would allow the russian room to move more force or defensive equipment out to other area according to u s official who were speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussion ukraine ha also been reliant on american intelligence report that pinpoint where the russian army is at it weakest the ukrainian military s counteroffensive outside kharkiv in september wa successful in part because the ukrainian were facing hollowed out unprepared russian force american official do not believe that even the russian military command knew how weak those force were or how badly prepared they were for a ukrainian strike american official are continuing to search for weak point in the russian line hunting for unit on the brink of collapse which might melt away in the face of a sustained push by ukraine finding those fragile unit could allow for smaller victory by ukrainian troop american official said what this war ha shown u is that it is better not to underestimate ukraine colin h kahl the under secretary of defense for policy said in an interview nevertheless kyiv s ability to mount effective strike against russian base and supply line will not be enough to dislodge moscow s troop from the part of the country where they are concentrated any smaller breakthrough by ukrainian force in the next few month are unlikely to lead to a broad collapse of the russian army these american official say but russia also is unlikely to achieve anything resembling a broad military victory in ukraine throughout the war russia s advance ha been hampered by a series of error russian troop entered ukraine with the intention of encircling and then capturing kyiv toppling the government of mr zelensky and cutting off ukraine s southern access to the black sea the only marginally successful one of those effort wa the attack from the south which eventually allowed russian troop after a protracted battle to take kherson and establish a land bridge to crimea although they never reached their original objective of odesa but even the southern offensive eventually stalled and kherson month later is back in ukrainian hand when russian unit failed to follow order russian general were forced to go to the front to shore up unit and when those general positioned themselves near communication array they disclosed their position allowing ukrainian force to kill several russian general american official say by failing to secure air superiority russian troop fought the first month of the war in contested sky forcing their pilot to launch strike from the border and then dart back to safety in russia or belarus this war favor the competent over the incompetent a all war do said frederick w kagan a scholar at the american enterprise institute who writes regularly about russian operation in ukraine the russian have been unsuccessful because they are showing their customary incompetence but american official say there is evidence that the kremlin is finally beginning to learn from it mistake it ha put a single general in charge of the war sergei surovikin who american official say is executing complicated military operation more efficiently in recent week ukrainian military official have said moscow ha conducted stepped up airstrikes on the army s defensive line increasing ukrainian casualty a botched a the initial russian partial mobilization of reservist wa the sheer number are now making a difference along the defensive line and unless those troop suffer a bad winter which is possible with poor logistics and bad leadership they will only shore up more by the spring american official said russian force are also digging into defensive position and building trench and they have given up area that require larger number of troop to hold moving instead to easier to secure position the retreat from kherson american official said is a key example of how russia ha learned lesson while president vladimir v putin initially blocked such a move general surovikin insisted it wa necessary until mr putin relented the retreat allowed russian force to use the dnipro river to protect themselves from further ukrainian attack the entire operation highlighted a sophisticated military execution that wa unusual earlier in the war american official said general surovikin who ha led russian force since october is using a strategy that emphasizes strategic defense these u s official say he ha so far been able to improve defense and inject discipline into russian troop deployed in ukraine s south and east their current push in bakhmut in the eastern donbas region is limited intended to secure better position from which to defend against a ukrainian counterattack he s consolidating position and he s trying to build a network of trench and a more sensible set of position and checkpoint dara massicot a senior policy researcher at the rand corporation said in a telephone interview m massicot said general surovikin wa also experimenting with new tactic for the russian air force including the manner with which it launch missile at ukraine to try to confuse it air defense these new russian tactic will most likely result in a stalemate leaving both side jostling for the upper hand if any real negotiation were to begin in some way the war is becoming one that hinge on ammunition and supply two basic need that can make or break either side it increasingly is a contest between the western industrial base and russian industrial base with some aid from the iranian north korean and a few other country said seth g jones a senior vice president at the center for strategic and international study with mr zelensky s arrival in washington the biden administration announced a new billion arm package that would send one patriot air defense battery to ukraine along with precision guided munition for fighter jet and other weaponry since the start of the war in february the united state ha sent more than billion in military aid to ukraine the package presented on wednesday will include air defense battery and precision guided bomb for the first time but even more weaponry for ground unit will be needed to avoid a stalemate in the month to come according to lawmaker and outside expert when the ukrainian go on the offensive again they will undoubtedly need more artillery and ammunition said representative seth moulton a massachusetts democrat on the house armed service committee who recently visited kyiv but they will also need thing like armored vehicle tank and other mobile platform that can help them advance against entrenched enemy force he said ukrainian force will also need a steady supply of anti aircraft missile anti armor system drone loitering munition aerial system that wait around passively in an area until a target is identified vehicle and aircraft they also need mundane item such a spare part petroleum oil and lubricant helping them replace depleted stockpile and broken equipment is critical mr moulton said president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine met with president biden at the white house during his first trip outside ukraine since the russian invasion began in february the visit amount to a daring show of solidarity with ukraine s most powerful ally and it largest foreign supplier of weapon sitting next to biden in the oval office zelensky spoke in english and expressed all my appreciation from my heart from the heart of ukrainian all ukrainian for the u s support biden told zelensky that the ukrainian people inspire the world zelensky will deliver an address to a joint session of congress later in the day in which he will again express gratitude but stress that ukraine still need more powerful weapon according to ukrainian politician follow our update the u s announced a new aid package of billion that includes a patriot missile battery the most advanced u s ground based air defense system the patriot could help ukraine defend against russian missile and drone attack that have targeted it energy infrastructure in military circle the patriot is viewed a a security blanket protection from incoming fire more aid zelensky s trip came after u s lawmaker proposed billion more in emergency aid to ukraine which would bring the total u s wartime assistance to more than billion but many republican lawmaker are hostile to authorizing more money to ukraine just a they are poised to take control of the house of representative in january russia in a speech to defense official yesterday president vladimir putin acknowledged russia s shortcoming but agreed to an increase in the size of russia s armed force he said there would be no limit in term of financing russia s campaign in ukraine in his first three

property or investment he also reported a gain in but in a the u s staggered under the coronavirus pandemic his finance reversed course trump reported a loss of million and paid zero income tax detail during his presidency the entirety of his core business mostly real estate golf course and hotel continued to report loss every year totaling million context the committee s vote to release trump s tax wa the culmination of a yearslong battle trump had broken with tradition by keeping his finance confidential during his campaign and while in office delayed audit the house committee also said that the i r s failed to audit trump during his first two year in office despite a program that make the auditing of sitting president mandatory background in the time released finding of an

nytimes com after month of blistering assessment from inside and outside russia that his war effort in ukraine lacked even the basic resource necessary to prevail president vladimir v putin delivered his own verdict on that criticism on wednesday it s valid in an unusual acknowledgment of russia s shortcoming in a speech at the ministry of defense in moscow the russian leader ticked off a list of area his military must improve on he declared that drone must be able to communicate targeting information through encrypted channel in real time he said the military needed to improve the command and control system and it ability to strike back at enemy artillery and he nodded to the widespread report of soldier being sent to the front without basic equipment instructing officer to pay attention to medical kit food dry ration uniform footwear protective helmet and bulletproof vest but far from an admission of defeat mr putin s reference to his army s woe reflected his defiant message on a day when ukraine s president put on a show of unity with the united state russia will keep fighting we have no limit in term of financing mr putin said insisting that russia would eventually prevail in ukraine the country and the government are providing everything that the army asks for everything even a ukraine s resistance captured the global spotlight with president volodymyr zelensky s trip to washington mr putin staged a showy gathering of his own addressing member of parliament and even patriarch kirill i of the russian orthodox church for a speech at an annual meeting of the military s top brass comparing the russian soldier fighting in ukraine to the hero who warded off napoleon s invading army in and defeated hitler in mr putin implied that his war wa just a existential never mind that it wa moscow now doing the invading he also sought to project an image of being in control of the war effort and attentive to the need of the common soldier at one point urging the gathered military brass to take criticism into account just a important to the kremlin mr putin sought to project an air of determination to the west the notion that no matter how much arm support ukraine get and despite the russian military s problem the kremlin remained determined to triumph in the end at the same time russian official are reminding the west they are prepared to make a deal to end the war on their term russia is always open to holding constructive peace talk sergei k shoigu the russian defense minister said after mr putin spoke mr shoigu promised to carry out change in the military s structure set up new unit and increase it target size by more than service member state television also showed mr shoigu giving mr putin a tour of modern russian military equipment including surveillance drone night vision equipment and a medical tent but while the message seemed to be that russia could correct mistake on the fly and regain momentum in the war expert cast doubt on whether this wa realistic the struggling russian economy weighed down by western sanction will impose it own limit on how much the kremlin can spend to improve it military they re trying to deal with a sharp deficit in manpower and equipment and hurriedly put together something that s falling apart said pavel luzin a russian military analyst who is a visiting scholar at tuft university the goal of all these attempt is to improve the negotiating position probably not anything more it wa not known whether wednesday s event wa purposely scheduled a counterprogramming to mr zelensky s high profile visit to washington but it played that role for a kremlin fiercely attentive to creating an aura of determination around mr putin earlier in the day the kremlin stuck to it line that any further western delivery of weapon to ukraine would only prolong the war all this of course lead to an aggravation of the conflict the kremlin s spokesman dmitri s peskov said referring to new american arm delivery and in fact doe not bode well for ukraine in another bit of countermessaging dmitri a medvedev the former russian president and the head of the governing united russia party met on wednesday in beijing with xi jinping the chinese leader a chinese and russian naval ship began weeklong joint exercise in the east china sea mr xi s rare in person meeting with a foreign official served a a reminder that russia retained the backing of china it most important international partner even though beijing had avoided declaring full throated support for russia s invasion mr xi told mr medvedev that relation between the two country had stood the test of international change and that their partnership wa a long term strategic choice made by both side according to the state broadcaster china central television that kind of alliance is important for mr putin a he square off against the west in follow up remark after his speech on wednesday he reprised his frequent contention that the goal of russia s adversary wa the disintegration and weakening of russia and had been for century there s nothing new here a war over ukraine s pro western turn he claimed wa bound to break out sooner or later of course military operation are always associated with tragedy and loss of life mr putin said but since it s inevitable better today than tomorrow he claimed that russia currently had an edge over the west in it nuclear force including it new hypersonic missile that helped create a certain margin of safety while he did not repeat the more overt threat he made in september that he could use nuclear weapon the comment wa a reminder that mr putin saw the ukraine war a part of a large scale struggle with the west in which his nuclear arsenal provides his ultimate backing after mr putin spoke mr shoigu delivered a speech in which he detailed an expansion of the russian military by more than service member to a target size of million it wa not immediately clear whether that expansion wa meant to include the draft of about soldier this fall but it appeared to be part of a push to further militarize russian society mr shoigu said that the age range for men who could be conscripted for their mandatory year of military service should be shifted to to from the current range to a measure that could make it harder for russian to use their university study to get deferment mr shoigu also described planned structural change in particular to the western military district an organizational entity whose troop are based across much of western russia and analyst say performed particularly poorly in ukraine it is an admission that the army turned out to be too small and that the elite western military district turned out to be ineffective said dmitri kuznets a military analyst for the independent russian language news outlet meduza kyiv ukraine before russia s full scale invasion of ukraine president volodymyr zelensky wa often brushed off a a former comedian who stumbled into the job of leading a nation with the seemingly na ve promise of cleaning up ukraine s endemic corruption after a quick trip tuesday to the bloodiest theater in the war he arrived in washington on wednesday a national hero and global superstar having forged a leadership style blending personal daring with deft messaging to rally his people at home and his ally abroad that aura ha served him and his country well to this point but mr zelensky arrives in washington at a pivotal time for ukraine when his troop lightning counteroffensive from this fall are slowing down he will be pleading for the more powerful weapon he belief ukraine need but he will have to walk a fine line by taking a daring trip abroad during wartime he is seeking to project strength and show confidence that ukraine will ultimately prevail but to make the case for continued financial and military support he need to draw attention to the dire threat ukraine still face without seeming weak president zelensky would like to present this trip a serious progress in the war volodymyr ariev a member of parliament in the opposition european solidarity party said in an interview it s a pretty clear message that the alliance of the united state and ukraine is maintained and is quite strong in ukraine the visit wa also seen a tied to the american political calendar coming a control of the house pas to the republican party some of whose member have voiced skepticism of continuing to funnel assistance to ukraine another of mr zelensky s principal aim analyst say is to maintain unified american support for the war doing whatever he can to avoid having it devolve into a partisan issue zelensky should not maneuver between the democrat and republican yevhen mahda a political commentator in kyiv said in an interview he should suggest a new paradigm the paradigm that ukraine today is at the epicenter of the battle between good and evil and by supporting ukraine the united state support good mr mahda added this is the necessary message mr zelensky a former comedian ha always had a keen sense of image and storytelling in politics which is evident in his following up a frontline visit to the eastern city of bakhmut with booming artillery a a backdrop with his address to congress it s an honor for me to be here today mr zelensky had told the soldier in bakhmut where russia ha been pressing a fierce offensive for month to those with child he said i wish that your sun that is your child will shine for you for them to motivate you to survive for sure and defend your family our family all of our state and the future of our child at a news conference on wednesday with president biden in washington where he delivered a personal plea for more economic and military support he had a similar message when asked what he would want the world to know i wish you peace he said switching from ukrainian to english and you understand it only when the war is in your country he added i wish you to see your child when they will go to university and to see their child analyst say that mr zelensky is also keenly aware that he need to bolster the morale of his people million of whom are living without electricity water or heating a winter set in for the most part however mr zelensky faced no political pressure at home and wa free to tailor the trip to the imperative of filling out his military s arsenal for the war the united state is by far the largest foreign supplier of weapon to the ukrainian army but the biden administration ha carefully calibrated it assistance to ukraine holding back longer range and more powerful weapon for fear of ukrainian strike on russian territory that could drag nato into the war two successful ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeast and in the south have run their course and the russian and ukrainian army are digging in along a new mile front line to maintain that progress ukrainian official and analyst say it military need more advanced weapon system mr zelensky will have the opportunity to address the concern of u s lawmaker about the oversight of military and financial aid to ukraine and he could be pushed on domestic matter like press freedom fighting corruption and ensuring check and balance between the court and executive branch but mr zelensky s major objective is to portray the war in stark term of good versus evil that he hope will transcend american politics and will give a sense of the rightness of his cause and the sense of what his people and his soldier feel said yuri makarov the editor in chief of the ukrainian national broadcasting company washington president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine delivered an emotional wartime appeal to a joint meeting of congress on wednesday night telling american that your money is not charity and vowing that his people would eventually secure an improbable victory against russia on behalf of all free nation against all odds and doom and gloom scenario ukraine did not fall mr zelensky said in halting but forceful english from the dais in the house chamber where he wa greeted with extended applause from lawmaker ukraine is alive and kicking he said and it give me good reason to share with you our first joint victory we defeated russia in the battle for mind of the world in blunt term mr zelensky pleaded for more military assistance from the lawmaker who are poised to approve billion in additional aid by the end of the week bringing the total over a year to nearly billion his message your support ha kept president vladimir v putin of russia from overrunning our country now keep it coming we have artillery yes thank you he said we have it is it enough honestly not really the money he added wa not charity it s an investment he said mr zelensky s visit to washington kept secret until the eve of his arrival for security reason wa a dramatic show of confidence by ukraine s leader who had not left his country since mr putin began his assault day ago in the space of hour just day before christmas mr zelensky flew from the battered front line of a country plunged into darkness by russian air attack to the marble lined room of the white house and the capitol where he repeatedly thanked american for being partner in ukraine s battle to survive dressed in his wartime uniform of an olive green sweater and cargo pant mr zelensky began his speech by insisting that the lengthy standing ovation wa too much for me he ended it just over minute later by delivering a blue and gold ukrainian battle flag to house speaker nancy pelosi who in return handed him a framed american flag that had flown over the capitol earlier in the day in honor of his visit the american flag in his right hand mr zelensky jabbed his left fist into the air triumphantly we stand we fight and we will win because we are united ukraine america and the entire free world he said may god protect our brave troop and citizen may god forever bless the united state of america merry christmas and a happy victorious new year his speech at the capitol capped a remarkable day of urgent personal diplomacy that began with more than two hour of closed door meeting with president biden at the white house where both men reaffirmed their determination to defend ukraine against russian force who invaded in february standing side by side in the east room with ukraine s flag hanging next to gleaming christmas decoration mr biden and mr zelensky faced reporter and pledged to continue fighting russia s invasion to force an end to mr putin s unwarranted aggression mr zelensky warned that his country wa digging in for a long cold winter of war and had little hope of securing a just peace with the terrorist who are battering his people the longer the war last the longer this aggression last there will be more parent who live for the sake of vengeance or revenge mr zelensky said through an interpreter standing at a podium next to mr biden so there can t be any just peace in the war that wa imposed on u he added mr biden pledged a united front with mr zelensky promising that we will stay with you for a long a it take the american people know that if we stand by in the face of such blatant attack on liberty and democracy and the core principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity the world would surely face worse consequence mr biden said but both leader sounded grim about the prospect for an end to the conflict any time soon mr biden said it wa critical to stand together through suggesting another year of war in the heart of europe mr zelensky offered a dire assessment of the month ahead we need to survive this winter he said we need to protect our people mr zelensky is certain to get some but not all of what he want before he head home barely hour after arriving in washington mr biden on wednesday announced delivery of a patriot missile battery to help ukraine defend against attack from the sky but the administration is still refusing longer range weapon that could strike deep into russia and potentially draw the united state into direct conflict with mr putin and his military mr zelensky s outstretched hand ha rankled some biden administration official at time during the past year wednesday s appearance at the white house offered a glimpse of the transactional nature of the relationship between the two men a mr zelensky acknowledged what he would do after receiving a patriot missile battery from the united state to help defend ukraine from air attack after that we will send another signal to president biden that we would like to get more patriot he said to scattered laughter in the room the aside underscored both the human dynamic at play between the two men and mr biden s fear that providing too much military assistance too quickly could unleash a broader conflict with russia and the west that would have even more dangerous consequence later when a reporter from ukraine asked mr biden why he didn t just give mr zelensky all the weapon he wanted mr biden quipped his answer is yes pointing at the ukrainian president i agree mr zelensky responded quickly in english prompting laughter from the audience the visit to the white house come a both side gird for month of continued fighting in russia official warned that delivery of new u s weapon would lead to an aggravation of the conflict and mr putin vowed that his government would provide everything that the army asks for everything in it search for conquest president zelensky s visit here is at least partially maybe primarily designed to bolster that support and rejuvenate the enthusiasm for ukraine s success said william b taylor jr who served a ambassador to ukraine from to that is all going to be necessary for the ukrainian to be able to pre empt a russian offensive the timing is perfect he said for mr biden the highly orchestrated visit is an opportunity to remind american why he ha committed the united state treasury though not it soldier to defending the border of a country a continent away it is critical he argues to stand up for the right of sovereign nation when international law is violated that decision ha not come without sacrifice and political cost for mr biden who rightly predicted before the war started that american would suffer economic consequence a the ramification of the first war in europe in decade rippled across the world gas and food price spiked helping to send inflation soaring in the united state and elsewhere now after rallying dozen of nation to oppose russia s invasion mr biden find himself needing to hold that coalition together for longer than anyone inside the white house imagined at the start of the war and he face a concerted effort by mr putin to break the alliance by restricting energy resource and attacking civilian area in ukraine the most important part of this visit might be to combat putin s belief that time is on his side in the war said richard haass president of the council on foreign relation putin can t win in the battlefield so what he s trying to do is break the will of the ukrainian people by his attack on civilian area and he s trying to break europe s will by energy denial ahead of their meeting on wednesday mr zelensky presented mr biden with a cross for military merit an award that he said wa given to him by a soldier on the front line in ukraine the soldier a captain said mr zelensky should give it to the very brave president who had saved many life in their country undeserved but much appreciated mr biden replied in a moment that underscored how the two leader are intertwined in the ongoing conflict but mr biden and mr zelensky must continue to build support among american voter and lawmaker some of whom have begun to have doubt about the wisdom of an open ended commitment to a conflict that show no sign of ending there remains widespread bipartisan support on capitol hill for financially supporting ukraine in it war against russia and the majority of republican have rallied behind the aid some in the party have however pushed for greater oversight of the money being sent to ukraine and others have questioned how much the country really need some republican lawmaker in congress have indicated that they will vote later this week against a trillion government spending bill that includes the money for ukraine after deadlocking over a pandemic immigration rule the senate adjourned on wednesday night without voting on the bill representative kevin mccarthy of california the republican leader in the house told reporter recently that i m not for a blank check for anything this is hardworking taxpayer money and i want to make sure whatever funding we spend go to the right place still during wednesday night s speech mr mccarthy applauded for mr zelensky there is growing evidence that american in both party are weary of the ongoing conflict some democrat have been hearing from constituent who question the routine infusion of aid and are pressing biden administration official to say how they think the conflict will end and when during his remark mr zelensky portrayed the war gripping his country in stark term he evoked world war ii and u s army force holding back hitler s force in the battle of the bulge during christmas ukraine he said is doing the same in christmas holding back putin s force which have been targeting civilian infrastructure with missile and iranian drone in two day we will celebrate christmas maybe candlelit not because it s more romantic no but because there will be no electricity he said describing his people a too proud to complain about their situation he compared ukraine s current war to america s war of independence we ukrainian will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success he said prompting a roar of applause from the lawmaker washington the giant annual spending bill unveiled by congress on tuesday contains more than billion in emergency aid for ukraine renewing the u s commitment to the country s defense a russia s invasion grind toward a second year the new wave of aid for ukraine billion more than president biden requested in mid november come amid growing concern among the country s backer about the depth of america s support some republican have questioned the massive spending while some progressive have called for peace talk the aid package consists mostly of military spending including nearly billion to arm and equip ukraine s force and to replenish defense department stockpile from which weapon are being sent to kyiv some of that money would also be used to bolster the defense of america s nato ally to protect against further russian aggression another billion would support a surge of u s force in eastern europe that mr biden ordered after the russian invasion including thousand of american troop deployed to poland and romania the omnibus budget bill which includes the new ukraine aid fund the federal government into next year to avoid a shutdown if congress pas it u s aid to kyiv since russia invaded in february will amount to more than billion allocated over four emergency spending package congressional leader hope to win approval for the spending this week in what wa perhaps a reflection of the enormousness of the aid package and the speed at which it wa assembled democratic and republican appropriator differed in their calculation of the final price tag democrat placed the figure at just under billion and republican said the total exceeded billion u s assistance ha been essential to ukraine s survival and the major blow the country ha dealt to russia s military which badly miscalculated how much resistance ukraine would mount mr biden ha said that the defense of ukraine wa vital to the defense of democracy and the core principle of national sovereignty the package also includes nonmilitary aid to keep ukraine s government and economy running a it withstands russian bombardment which have increasingly targeted the nation s infrastructure congress is proposing to spend billion to shore up ukraine s economy and address dire energy shortage caused by russian attack another billion would go mainly to assist ukrainian refugee whose number are expected to grow a russian attack leave major city without heat and electricity this winter some of that money would address the need of migrant in other region of the world some republican have called for reducing u s aid to ukraine or imposing new oversight and condition on the money but a fact sheet published by republican on the senate appropriation committee which manages federal spending boasted that the package reject the administration s request to throttle down support for the ukrainian war effort an apparent reference to the somewhat lower spending level proposed by the white house last month mr biden ha vowed to side with ukraine against russian aggression for a long a it take a poll released earlier this month by the nonpartisan chicago council on global affair found that about two third of american favor continuing military and economic support for ukraine though le than half of american back continuing current level of such support indefinitely and a growing number nearly half favor pressuring

on monday according to russian state news agency ta russia ha maintained a close knit relationship with belarus in the past few month with the country supplying the russian force with missile and equipment the russian military also ha up to troop in belarus so when we are asking our partner and primarily the u s for example to provide ukraine with atacms army tactical missile system missile we need those not to strike russia on their own territory we need those to conduct our military operation with lesser risk for our own military personnel said sak despite discussion with the pentagon and the white house the patriot program is not finalized but source tell fox news that there is an announcement expected this week there is talk about you know the possibility of ukraine receiving patriot air defense system from the u s now we know that russia is talking to iran with a view to acquiring from iran more ballistic missile so this is a race in which we need to be one step ahead said sak

minsk since before the covid pandemic and a wave of pro democracy protest in that lukashenko crushed with strong support from the kremlin russian force used belarus a a launch pad for their abortive attack on the ukrainian capital kyiv in february and there ha been russian and belarusian military activity there for month ukraine s top general valery zaluzhniy told the economist last week that russia wa preparing fresh troop for a major offensive that could come from the east south or even from belarus a early a january but more likely in spring moscow and minsk have set up a joint military unit in belarus and held numerous exercise three russian warplane and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to belarus last week but lukashenko a pariah in the west who relies heavily on moscow for support ha repeatedly said belarus will not enter the war in ukraine foreign diplomat say committing belarusian troop would be deeply unpopular at home already western sanction have made it hard for belarus to ship potash fertilizer it top export via baltic port western military analyst say lukashenko s small army lack the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing ukraine to commit force to it north it could leave it more exposed to russian assault elsewhere putin s visit wa announced on friday after a surprise dec trip to belarus by defence minister sergei shoigu where he signed an agreement with his belarusian counterpart whose detail were not disclosed adding to the ominous mood music belarusian foreign minister vladimir makei one of the few official in lukashenko s government with any rapport with the west died suddenly last month no official cause of death wa announced his successor sergei aleinik met russian

meeting after the talk with putin were announced lukashenko unexpectedly said that any ceding of sovereignty would be a betrayal of the belarusian people particularly after these large scale negotiation everyone will say that s it there are no longer any authority in belarus the russian are already walking around and running the country lukashenko said he said he would discus economic cooperation energy supply defense and security with putin president vladimir v putin of russia made a rare visit to belarus on monday to strengthen his bond with the country s president and his

describing what that would entail and had agreed to continue joint military exercise mr putin s visit took place a russia continued it nighttime bombardment campaign against ukraine s power plant and other crucial infrastructure deepening the country s misery and the trip seemed certain to escalate concern in kyiv about the possibility of a fresh ground offensive that could use belarus a a launching pad ukraine ha repeatedly warned in recent day that russian force could be preparing a new assault from belarus aimed at trying once again to seize kyiv only about mile from the belarusian border or at disrupting the flow of western arm and aid into ukraine from poland defense minister from russia and belarus signed an unspecified agreement this month to strengthen military tie and belarus said last week that it wa checking the combat readiness of it troop the last time it did that wa just day before russia invaded ukraine from it territory mr putin continues to use belarus to train and supply his battered force in ukraine mr lukashenko said that russia wa also helping belarus train it military pilot to fly plane with special payload without elaborating he did not mention

russia this wa mr putin s first trip to belarus since according to russian state medium and mr lukashenko wa waiting on the tarmac to greet him with a hug in a sarcastic remark that seemed to address the two country international isolation month into the war mr lukashenko called himself and mr putin both co aggressor the most harmful toxic people on the planet mr lukashenko ha been almost wholly reliant on mr putin since the russian leader helped crush street protest that erupted in belarus in august after mr lukashenko declared an improbable landslide victory in a contested election he

drone by radar some military analyst have said that a flurry of military activity in belarus including the arrival of thousand of russian troop ostensibly for training could be part of an elaborate ruse aimed at forcing ukraine to divert troop to the north from active front in the east and south of the country konrad muzyka an independent defense analyst said open source intelligence suggests that russia ha to soldier engaged in training activity in belarus although that is a small fraction of the number they had when they began the full scale invasion the institute for the study of war a washington based research group said in a report published on friday that a new russian thrust into ukraine wa unlikely a there are still no indicator that russian force are forming a strike force in belarus still mr putin s meeting with mr lukashenko according to the institute will reinforce the russian information operation designed to convince ukrainian and westerner that russia may attack ukraine from belarus the kremlin s spokesman dmitri s peskov dismissed speculation that belarus could become more directly involved in the war telling reporter on monday that such talk wa based on totally stupid groundless fabrication mr peskov similarly dismissed warning from the united state at the start of the year that russia wa planning to invade ukraine insisting that moscow had sent troop to belarus only for training exercise having passed both chamber of congress by wide margin the national defense authorization act ndaa is now headed to the president though delayed through mi prioritization of the legislative process the final bill accomplishes it most important task authorizing funding and providing a policy framework to strengthen the nation s defense also included is a provision lifting the covid vaccine mandate for service member with military recruiting falling well short of it target it is hard to argue the wisdom of separating service member or denying

taiwan enhanced resilience act this will serve to enhance u s taiwanese relation in the face of chinese adventurism it authorizes billion over five year to strengthen security cooperation make taiwan eligible for a regional contingency munition stockpile combat chinese coercive activity advocate taiwan s participation in international organization and support stronger economic and cultural tie appropriator must now fund the program but this is a necessary first step finally the ndaa includes increased accountability for ukraine aid prior u s aid package to ukraine had extensive accountability and reporting requirement but the ndaa build upon that by requiring the defense department state department and the u s agency for international development to develop a framework reviewable by congress for conducting comprehensive review and audit of all assistance they provide to ukraine the bill is not perfect some provision unrelated to national defense remain but lawmaker

question or concern ukraine is bracing for the possibility that russia will sharply escalate the war in a winter offensive a moscow try to turn the tide on the battlefield and limit political backlash at home a senior adviser to president volodymyr zelensky said on sunday despite suffering severe setback over the first month of war the russian military is now laying plan for mass infantry attack akin to the tactic employed by the soviet union during world war ii the adviser mykhailo podolyak said in written response to question mr podolyak s comment came a ukraine s top military and political leader have been warning in a series of recent interview that russia is massing troop and armament to launch a renewed ground offensive by spring that very likely would include a second attempt to seize kyiv the ukrainian capital russia ha already drafted and is training soldier who might be deployed in mass infantry attack mr podolyak said it is one of several possible threat that ukraine face from russia over the winter month he said a official in kyiv see little sign that president vladimir v putin of russia is seeking an end to the war russia s political leadership clearly refuse to acknowledge the tactical defeat that already took place and grasp at any even the most illusory chance to change the situation in it favor mr podolyak said ukrainian official have said they base their assessment of russia s war aim on the finding of their military and foreign intelligence agency and on consultation with ally in his comment mr podolyak said that ukraine wa taking the risk of a fresh russian offensive seriously and emphasized that it ally should understand this too a western government plan for future weapon transfer to ukraine he suggested the equipment should match the future threat it is extremely important that our partner take these risk no le seriously he said russia is not interested in ending the war until it suffers a significant military defeat and is forced to focus on it own internal political transformation ukraine s supreme military commander gen valeriy zaluzhnyi said in an interview with the economist published last week that ukraine wa training and outfitting reserve to defend against a new russian offensive that might come in january february or march the russian are preparing some fresh troop he said i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv the statement by senior ukrainian official appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign to guard against complacency among ukraine s ally a the russian army struggle on the battlefield since launching it full scale invasion of ukraine in february russia ha fallen back in three major retreat from the territory around kyiv in the northeastern kharkiv region and last month in the southern region of kherson the warning also appear to be an attempt to counter the kremlin s effort to persuade ukraine s western ally to pressure kyiv into a negotiated settlement in parallel with the fighting along the front line russia ha bombarded civilian infrastructure target throughout the country knocking out heating water and electricity for million of ukrainian in his nightly address to ukrainian on saturday mr zelensky said that electricity had been restored to six million people who lost power after a salvo of missile strike on friday the mayor of kyiv vitali klitschko said on sunday that neighborhood heating system damaged in the strike had been fully restored military analyst say that this campaign is intended to demoralize ukrainian and push the ukrainian government into a cease fire that might allow russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensive but analyst who rely on open source intelligence have said it is difficult to know what is happening at russian military training base the kremlin said in september that it would mobilize additional soldier and that some are already deployed in ukraine mr podolyak said that the type of mass infantry warfare moscow seems to be preparing for would not be effective against ukraine s increasingly modern arsenal of precision guided weaponry and surveillance drone but he said that the russian military leadership had bent to kremlin demand for advance on the ground for domestic political reason russian commander he said diligently maintain putin s illusion of the possibility of victory in order to firstly maintain putin s personal power and secondly to avoid harsh punishment for admitting loss in their most recent setback russian force retreated last month from the southern ukrainian city of kherson but remain within artillery range on the opposite bank of the dnipro river through the day on sunday russian force fired artillery at kherson wounding three people kyrylo tymoshenko a deputy presidential chief of staff said in a post on telegram in it morning update on the status of the battlefield on sunday the ukrainian military said that it had repulsed ground assault on it position over the past hour and that multiple frontline town and village had been targeted by russian artillery most of the attack came in the donbas area of eastern ukraine the only section of the front line where the russian army is regularly staging offensive attack along much of the rest of the crescent shaped front line in southeastern ukraine russian force are in a defensive crouch building fortification along new line after their retreat earlier in the fall washington the prospect of growing military threat from both china and russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in pentagon spending setting up another potential boom for weapon maker that is likely to extend beyond the war in ukraine congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately billion or billion above what president biden had requested if approved at this level the pentagon budget will have grown at percent per year over the last two year even after inflation compared with an average of le than percent a year in real dollar between and according to an analysis by center for strategic and budgetary assessment for the new york time spending on procurement would rise sharply next year including a percent jump in army funding to buy new missile and a percent jump for the navy s weapon purchase on friday jake sullivan mr biden s national security adviser put the buildup in strategic term saying the war in ukraine had exposed shortfall in the nation s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the united state is able to support ukraine and to be able to deal with contingency elsewhere in the world lockheed martin the nation s largest military contractor had booked more than million worth of it own missile military order from the pentagon in part to refill stockpile being used in ukraine the army ha awarded raytheon technology more than billion in contract to deliver missile system to expand or replenish weapon used to help ukraine we went through six year of stinger in month gregory j hayes raytheon s chief executive said in an interview earlier this month referring to of the company s shoulder fired antiaircraft missile sent by the u s government to ukraine so it will take u multiple year to restock and replenish but those contract are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup military spending next year is on track to reach it highest level in inflation adjusted term since the peak in the cost of the iraq and afghanistan war between and and the second highest in inflation adjusted term since world war ii a level that is more than the budget for the next largest cabinet agency combined even more order are coming in to military contractor from u s ally in europe and asia a they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threat japan moved this month to double it spending on defense over the next five year putting aside a pacifist stand it ha largely maintained since and none of this count an estimated billion of planned but now delayed weapon delivery by the united state to arm taiwan against a possible future attack by china the combination of the ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting effort to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surge in demand the issue ha become urgent in some case a the u s and it nato ally seek to keep weapon flowing to ukraine without diminishing their own stock to worrisome level the ukrainian military ha run through year worth of the missile production capacity of western supplier in a matter of month at the same time contractor remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapon that could dry up again when the war end or politics shift course the difficulty of starting a production line back up that doesn t come for free tom arseneault president of bae system which is now considering restarting it m howitzer manufacturing line which the company had been in the process of shutting down the m is a highly accurate towed gun that fire millimeter artillery shell which are also in diminishing supply the annual military authorization bill that passed the senate on thursday prevents the air force and navy from retiring aging weapon system that the military would like to take out of service including certain c transport plane or f fighter jet at the same time it includes billion of dollar in extra money to build even more new ship and plane than the pentagon itself asked for including billion alone for an extra navy guided missile destroyer according to the senate armed service committee and there is million to expand ammunition plant in spot such a scranton pa middletown iowa and kingsport tenn where contractor work with the army to manufacture the ammunition that ukrainian artillery crew have burned through at an alarming rate the money for these program is expected to be included in a huge appropriation bill that appears to be on track to pa congress and signed into law by mr biden by the end of the week spending could be even higher a congress is also considering a request for an extra billion for the pentagon above the already expanded annual budget to allocate more money to resupply material used in ukraine in an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military congress this year ha moved to allow the defense department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitment for certain weapon system and shipbuilding operation that is a provision that industry lobbyist have long pushed for arguing it give company certainty that investment they make to start production will see continued return in future year we have to make a commitment with the industry said senator deb fischer republican of nebraska and a member of the senate armed service committee who supported the change then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production line that move alone suggests billion in additional munition order could be on the way in the next three year contract that will largely benefit the big player like lockheed and raytheon according to an analysis by myles walton a military industry analyst at wolfe research a wall street research firm these trend help explain stock market performance of the major military contractor a small group of which control the bulk of sale to the pentagon lockheed and northrop grumman both have seen their stock price jump more than percent so far this year in a market whose main index are down overall for the year opponent of higher military budget say they are frustrated military contractor are riding high again and ukraine just give them another argument a to why thing need to continue onward and upward said william d hartung a fellow at the non interventionist quincy institute for responsible statecraft the trillion dollar defense budget that is where we are headed said lawrence j korb who served a an assistant defense secretary during the reagan administration and wa once a vice president at raytheon nobody seems to want to make the tough choice even the democrat now seem to be afraid to be seen a being soft on defense the biggest barrier for growth for major military contractor the list includes lockheed raytheon boeing general dynamic bae northrop grumman and huntington ingalls industry is finding sufficient supply of key component such a microelectronics and missile warhead a well a a steady supply of new employee to assemble all these item you cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilder that build u s warship in the united state of america right now adm michael m gilday the chief of naval operation said this month during the reagan national defense forum in california referring to a billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is billion more than the pentagon requested their capacity is about at max and congress is helping u max them out raytheon which ha worker ha hired new employee so far this year it chief executive said in october but even with that it is still running into bottleneck in term of available part and labor shortage that are slowing sale it executive said the sheer scale of the munition and missile sent to ukraine illustrates just how much mat riel a war can consume that includes more than million round of small arm ammunition at least one million round of millimeter artillery shell anti tank weapon more than stinger antiaircraft missile and javelin anti armor missile according to a pentagon tally the resupply challenge is not just a matter of money military contractor have nearly stopped manufacturing stinger raytheon s last contract from the u s government wa in mr haynes said and while javelin are still being made jointly by raytheon and lockheed in september they were awarded a million contract to deliver more of them historically they have been able to make only about a year or about a quarter of what ukraine ha burned through since the outbreak of the war in february in total the pentagon a of early december had awarded at least billion to military contractor to resupply these and other item sent to ukraine we re going to ramp up army secretary christine wormuth said this month we ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they re able to produce the overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low a a percentage of the nation s economy about percent of the gross domestic product this year compared to percent during world war ii and percent during the korean war according to pentagon record still company are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottleneck caused by the increase in demand lockheed for example spent more than million of it own money in advance of getting pentagon contract commitment to build more of it high mobility artillery rocket system vehicle or himars which fire guided rocket carrying pound of explosive that can hit target nearly mile away the vehicle have been much sought after by ukraine which ha used them to devastating effect against the russian traditionally lockheed ha been able to build of these truck per year but it is now shifting production to hour a day and seven day a week in an effort to bring that annual total to unit it also now ha a new million contract to deliver more himars along with a new million contract to build more of the rocket called gmlrs that these vehicle can fire these resupply order while large in term of many other contract the federal government issue are still relatively small for the biggest contractor at lockheed for example about percent of sale come from the u s government and most of the rest from other government worldwide supply chain and labor shortage problem are cutting into sale and profit including at lockheed which expects to see annual sale decline this year to billion from billion the clutch is engaging but into some lower gear initially james taiclet lockheed s chief executive said in october adding that higher sale might not show up for another year but there are more of the big ticket order coming in the aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine switzerland and germany have both moved in recent month to finalize order for the f fighter jet collectively worth billion overall foreign military sale notification to congress so far in have totaled billion the third highest figure in the last year with an increasing share of these sale going to european and asian nation next year s military budget also includes major investment in new hypersonic weapon that are also being aggressively pursued by china raytheon and northrop grumman in september won a billion contract just to build prototype for the air force other company want to replace older equipment sent to ukraine with newer model bae for example intends to sell the army more armored vehicle called ampvs in place of the more than of bae s vietnam era m armored personnel carrier sent to ukraine which it no longer make nothing s cheap right said navy secretary carlos del toro this month at the conference in california a he ran through many new investment the navy is making nothing s free america s aid campaign for ukraine ha opened the door for a surge in domestic defense spending both to refill stockpile of weapon sent overseas and to bolster u s readiness against near peer rival president biden requested for the pentagon for but congress appears poised to pa an billion budget plan if passed the money will go toward purchasing missile for the army new weapon system for the navy and expanding ammunition plant among other thing the new york time reported sunday the traditional measure of u s military readiness ha been it capacity to supply and carry out two major conflict in separate area of the globe white house national security adviser jake sullivan argued last week that u s support for ukraine ha revealed weakness in that readiness china s recent aggression toward taiwan ha also contributed to call for more spending aid to the self governed island ha already been delayed thanks in large part to the flow of weapon to ukraine the u s ha sent nearly billion in military aid to ukraine since february so much that president biden s administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used the volume of u s aid to the country ha given rise to some skeptic within the republican party who are calling for greater accountability nevertheless funding conflict with near peer rival is far more expensive than the asymmetric warfare the u s military ha largely engaged in this century the potential billion budget would represent a annual increase over the past two year according to nyt and the u s isn t the only one ally like japan have also announced ramped up military spending in the face of growing chinese aggression sullivan congratulated japanese prime minister fumio kishida on his administration s new defense buildup program on friday anders hagstrom is a reporter with fox news digital covering national politics and major breaking news event send tip to anders hagstrom fox com or on twitter hagstrom anders a team of new york time reporter investigated one of the central question of the war in ukraine why ha russia bungled it invasion so badly the story based on secret battle plan intercept and interview with russian soldier and kremlin confidant offer new insight into president vladimir v putin s state of mind the stunning failure of his military and u s effort to prevent a direct war with russia here are eight takeaway from the report reached by phone inside russian hospital wounded soldier described being sent to war with little food training bullet or equipment and watching about two third of their platoon get killed material recovered from battlefield point to the military s lack of preparation a map from the s a wikipedia printout on how to operate a sniper rifle a wildly optimistic timetable for russia s invasion in interview one soldier recalled asking how to use his rifle just before heading off to battle while another described how his supervisor revealed they were going to war tomorrow you are going to ukraine to fuck up some shit many of the people closest to mr putin fed his suspicion magnifying his grievance against the west a former confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social medium algorithm they read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff mr putin planned the invasion in such secrecy that even dmitri s peskov his spokesman said in an interview that he learned of it only once it had begun anton vaino mr putin s chief of staff and aleksei gromov mr putin s powerful medium adviser also said they did not know in advance according to people who spoke to them about it the united state tried to stop ukraine from killing a top russian general american official found out that gen valery gerasimov wa planning a trip to the front line but withheld the information from the ukrainian worried that an attempt on his life could lead to a war between the united state and russia the ukrainian learned of the trip anyway after an internal debate washington took the extraordinary step of asking ukraine to call off an attack only to be told that the ukrainian had already launched it dozen of russian soldier were said to have been killed general gerasimov wasn t one of them a senior russian official told the c i a director william j burn last month that russia would not give up no matter how many of it soldier were killed or injured one nato member is warning ally that mr putin might accept the death or injury of a many a russian troop roughly three time his estimated loss so far before the war when mr burn warned russia not to invade ukraine another senior russian official said russia s military wa strong enough to stand up even to the american day into the invasion mr putin told israel s leader that the ukrainian had turned out to be tougher than i wa told but he warned the leader prime minister naftali bennett we are a big country and we have patience earlier in october during his first meeting with mr bennett mr putin had railed against president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine what kind of jew is he he s an enabler of nazism invading russian soldier used their cellphone to call home enabling the ukrainian military to find and kill them phone intercept obtained by the time showed the bitterness russian soldier felt toward their own commander they re preparing you to be cannon fodder one soldier said another described a commander warning him he could be prosecuted for leaving his position only for the commander to flee when shelling began his wheel didn t even get stuck in the mud the soldier said the day of the invasion mr putin set a trap for russian business tycoon putting them on television to tar everyone there a one of them described it indeed the businessmen present were all hit by western sanction in the month that followed even so another billionaire at the kremlin that day andrey melnichenko wa defiant insisting sanction would not make russian tycoon turn against mr putin in textbook they call this political terrorism he said mr putin s fractured army have sometimes turned on each other one soldier said a tank commander deliberately fired on a russian checkpoint mr putin divided his force into fief some led by people who are not even part of the military such a his former bodyguard the leader of chechnya and a mercenary bos who ha provided catering for kremlin event yevgeny prigozhin in an interview after being captured by ukraine one russian soldier said he had been in prison for murder when mr prigozhin recruited him later after he wa returned to russia in a prisoner swap a video emerged of his execution by sledgehammer president vladimir v putin of russia made a surprise visit to a command post coordinating the russian war effort in ukraine the kremlin said on saturday in a rare demonstration of hand on involvement in the military campaign s execution and planning mr putin spent the day on friday in the military headquarters in an undisclosed location presiding over a general meeting with russia s top brass and holding separate one with various commander the kremlin said in a statement in his opening remark carried on russian state television mr putin said he had come to listen to his commander proposal about the russian military s short and medium term movement a russia s military campaign ha suffered a series of painful and embarrassing setback mr putin ha distanced himself from the blunder clearly unwilling to associate himself with defeat all the while he ha maintained a studied calm insisting against all reason that the war is going according to plan for instance mr putin never commented publicly about his army s retreat from the city of kherson the only ukrainian regional capital russia had captured since the invasion in february he also never made public visit to the front line or even to territory captured by russia instead mr putin concentrated on economic affair such a opening a turkey breeding factory in siberia in november trying to show that it wa all business a usual in russia the friday meeting demonstrated a shift in that approach russian war analyst said while few people doubt that any major military decision can be made in russia without mr putin s approval the fact that the friday meeting wa made public meant that the kremlin want to send a clear signal that the russian leader is in charge and is interested in the war s progress said yuri fyodorov a russian military analyst mr putin demonstrated that he is responsible for the situation at the front mr fyodorov said in a telephone interview this is not a coincidence in light of report that russia might be getting ready to launch an offensive in ukraine besides the stagecraft designed to show he is in control the meeting served a number of other end for mr putin analyst said it presented a rare occasion for him to appear together with his top commander the defense minister sergei k shoigu and the chief of general staff valeri v gerasimov who have faced heavy criticism from russian military blogger and are frequent target of rumor of their dismissal and by mentioning mid term planning analyst said he wa able to emphasize his determination if any wa needed to see the war through to it conclusion in the early stage of the war mr putin delegated the decision making to various branch of the military that ha blurred line of responsibility but also undermined coordination between troop formation in october a it became clear even to the war s supporter that russia s initial drive into ukraine had failed mr putin appointed gen sergei surovikin a the commander of the country s force some analyst have speculated that general surovikin wa appointed a a scapegoat to shift the blame from mr putin for instance shortly after his appointment the general announced that tough decision might be coming in early november he called for the withdrawal from kherson dmitri kuznets a military analyst for the independent russian language news outlet meduza said that mr putin s visit to the war headquarters wa a way to demonstrate that the russian president keep his finger on the pulse and want the upcoming decision to be associated with him however he said there are no sign that russia is preparing a large scale ground offensive operation russia is trying to build a new army now because the old one ha been depleted he added noting that russian troop are trying to master modern war method on the fly something many military analyst say is better done through year of training away from the pressure of the battlefield in the u congress both democrat and republican equally support kiev a well a the desire of the white house to exert pressure on russia secretary of state antony blinken said he met with u s senator and then visited congress to meet with member of the house of representative blinken said what i heard there

kiev and it will do so for a long a it take ryder said we are focused on providing ukraine with the security assistance it need to defend itself we said we would do this long before russia decided to

pandolfo fox com and follow him on twitter chriscpandolfo we asked the prime minister of ukraine mykola azarov who wa overthrown by the maidan about this in the studio of radio komsomolskaya pravda who by the way turn year old nikolai yanovich how do you live in russia i wa born in russia in kaluga and i lived a significant part of my life here the motherland is the motherland you visit kaluga of course my mother lived there i often visited her even when i worked in ukraine now my sister is there i definitely visit the graf all my loved one are there your career in kiev wa hindered by the fact that you come from russia studied in moscow up to a point no but when i had already reached a high level i broke through moskal pull u into the taiga union a the custom union wa called by it opponent in ukraine ed i wa often reproached for speaking russian i considered it extremely important that the russian people hear the russian speech from the head of the government even in the western region i tried to speak russian emphasizing the bilingualism of the country why didn t you make russian the second state language in ukraine we managed to adopt the law on regional language it allowed the russian to be equal in region where russian made up a significant portion of the population and what is characteristic after the coup d tat the first thing the putschists canceled wa this law how you were received in the west of ukraine i had a case back during the presidency of kuchma azarov wa then the first deputy prime minister ed he sent me to the lviv region and said and kuchma himself did not speak ukrainian very well mykola you need to learn the text for minute otherwise you can get there i say it would be right if i start my speech by removing to people from their job i know the psychology of westerner well they respect strength if they feel that a person ha arrived who can make a decision they no longer dare to shout something there now this psychology ha changed absolutely not they have been in the service of hundred of year from the austrian the pole they have that kind of psychology and if they see that they have more power they begin to persecute humiliate other people that s what we re seeing now yanukovych under whom you worked a prime minister wa quite neutral until but suddenly everyone wa going to sign an association with the european union why all of a sudden when we came to power we began to deal with case and we inherited from the previous administration a package of document on preparation for the association with the eu most of the work ha already been done plus they needed cheap money from the international monetary fund imf and it wa a trap we understood that our main market is russia and the country of the former ussr but on the other hand we need money and technology where can i get them we decided that in the west and you went to the west not either there we were required to switch to european standard and that meant rebuilding the entire industry you can t do that in a year or two and the butting began and what about russia russia told u choose but ukraine will not be a transit zone where western good go in a direct course local sticker are slapped on them and taken to russia without any duty we re in a stalemate therefore they wanted to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the eu until we reach an agreement relation with europe and america immediately became strained and russia and china have offered agreement worth billion of dollar and then the maidan broke out this wa taken advantage of of course by the american special service they decided that this wa an opportunity and launched a coup scenario what wa the main slogan on the maidan the girl there wa standing with a poster i don t want the taiga union i want the european union and lace panty well this girl got the full program what wa agreed with russia then we have signed agreement on cheap gas we have outlined a whole program for the production of a good aircraft based on the an heavy missile it is now russia that ha created it own sarmat and then all the heavy rocket were designed by the dnepropetrovsk yuzhmash if it were not for the maidan what kind of relation would ukraine have with russia back in putin nazarbayev lukashenko and kuchma launched the project of the common economic space the four freedom are the movement of good labour capital and service in fact this wa the custom union but not the new ussr what is the soviet union it s a common market no custom uniform standard it s the same in the eu they ve come to this and we on the contrary fell apart who benefited from this we all lost and so we started working to get back but while maintaining political independence and then it began from whose side our foreign ministry and the ministry of justice tried especially hard there were mostly westerner the ministry of foreign affair hired only those who knew the ukrainian language god know what kind of special if only he would be a joke on the move and the creation of the common economic space wa very closely monitored by the american to them this treaty wa like a knife under the heart and they torpedoed it with the first maidan yushchenko s orange revolution the same thing happened again on the second maidan if in the maidan had not won and azarov had remained the prime minister of ukraine what would it be now we had a program to activate the economy through technological industry i have already said everywhere that ukraine will not go far on one grain that is the bet wa on technology yes and there would be stability when i wa prime minister for dollar they gave hryvnia now hryvnia for ed palyanitsa this is the main bread in kiev cost hryvnia kopeck so what would ukraine be like prosperous the income of the population for year according to our plan should have grown by time a a result by compared to the per caput income of ukrainian in term of currency decreased by a quarter ed what are the option and chance for ukraine now a chance will appear if you change the leadership well you can not go further with these adventurer puppet with them the country cannot but develop it cannot exist here is viktor orban prime minister of hungary ed one of the independent european politician said about zelensky you have to be an idiot to get into a conflict with a major nuclear power with this leadership ukraine ha no future and how it will actually be ukraine is not an independent player now who make decision for her leader of russia and the united state the answer to your question depends on them is someone calling you from ukraine colleague acquaintance of course only we communicate in a complex way ukraine is under the hood back in my day american were eavesdropping on everyone there and now everything there is just under their full control ukrainian propaganda tell u that everyone there is united in hatred of russia well there isn t one there are a lot of people with whom you can work you maintain relation with yanukovych congratulation to each other on holiday on birthday by phone i don t want to idealize him but he wasn t who

barrage came a ukrainian military and political leader warned in a series of interview and news conference that russia wa preparing for a new ground offensive this winter and would likely make another attempt to seize kyiv they did not cite specific intelligence but their statement amounted to a coordinated pushback against talk from moscow and some official in the country backing ukraine about possible peace negotiation president volodymyr zelensky and his top adviser insist that russia which invaded unprovoked in february is not serious about peace and that any pause in the war would only give the kremlin time to cement it grip on the territory it ha seized and to rebuild it force for a renewed assault on ukraine official in kyiv fear that their western backer wearying of high energy price and the cost of supplying ukraine might be all too eager to accept a cease fire ukraine s defense minister oleksii reznikov told the guardian newspaper that a new russian offensive could come a soon a february general valeriy zaluzhnyi the country s top military commander said in an interview with the economist that it may take place in february at best in march and at worst at the end of january and could come from the east north or south the russian are preparing some fresh troop general zaluzhnyi said i have no doubt they will have another go at kyiv he did not cite evidence for either assertion russia s military ha been badly mauled in the war suffering by western estimate more than casualty and seriously depleting it supply of missile and armored vehicle president vladimir v putin in september ordered the call up of conscript some of whom have been deployed to ukraine often with inadequate training or equipment western official and military analyst said that ukraine s assessment of kremlin intention wa probably correct and that mr putin still aim to subjugate ukraine even if his capability may not match his ambition and u s official have made clear that they do not expect the war to end any time soon but expert said they did not see evidence so far of russian force preparing for a major new push and questioned whether they would be able to mount one over the winter though it is difficult to know what is happening on russian base we re not seeing any indication of an imminent move on kyiv john f kirby a spokesman for the national security council told reporter in washington although he emphasized that mr putin had not abandoned his maximalist aspiration to control ukraine and could at some point seek to expand the war again konrad muzyka an independent defense analyst and the director of rochan consulting said it seemed unlikely that russia would be able to mount a large scale counterattack in the next two to three month given it heavy loss current failure to prepare soldier for winter combat and continuing logistical and organizational struggle with their troop losing a large chunk of the territory they had conquered in eastern and southern ukraine russian force this fall dramatically increased their aerial attack on civilian infrastructure across the country in an apparent bid to terrorize and immiserate the population and sap it will to fight they still have enough missile for several such heavy strike mr zelensky said in his nightly video address we have enough determination and self belief to return our own after these blow in the interview with the economist general zaluzhnyi struck a more ominous tone we are balancing on a fine line he said if the russian destroy the grid that is when soldier wife and child start freezing at that point he said what kind of mood the fighter will be in can you imagine without water light and heat can we talk about preparing reserve to keep fighting the russian have fired ballistic missile cruise missile and iranian made exploding drone and there are fear that they will also turn to tehran to replenish their stock of ballistic missile the biden administration is expected to supply ukraine with a patriot missile battery the most advanced american air defense system which unlike others used by ukraine can shoot down ballistic missile flying at several time the speed of sound ukrainian air defense have become adept at deflecting the attack so russia ha taken to firing missile and drone in large swarm a many a at a time from multiple direction to overwhelm those defense and allow some to penetrate but recent experience show that even a few reaching their target can do significant and lethal damage and sometimes falling debris from missile that are shot down doe a well general zaluzhnyi said in a statement that russia had launched projectile at infrastructure target on friday across ukraine whose air defense managed to shoot down of them that ratio

athlete to compete under a neutral flag would not be enough to punish russia since february ukrainian athlete have died a a result of russia s action mr zelensky said on the call according to a readout from the ukrainian president s office one cannot try to be neutral when the foundation of peaceful life are being destroyed and universal human value are being ignored in february the i o c

statement the organization cited the integrity of global sport competition and the safety of all the participant a two factor in the decision which wa issued with a heavy heart there are some

few day ending a three week lull in attack with wave of drone ukrainian official and military expert have said the pause in using drone even a russian continued to attack with missile could mean the device were malfunctioning in ukraine s damp subfreezing weather the attack on wednesday suggested that if there wa such a glitch it had been fixed ukraine s air defense shot down all of the iranian

app well done i m proud mr zelensky said we thank the air defense force compared to missile drone are much slower and easier to shoot down they carry smaller warhead often have shorter range and are le precise but there ha been speculation that russia is running low on precision guided missile drone are also far cheaper allowing an army to fire them by the dozen or even the hundred overwhelming

on it wing for ryazan apparently a claim that the attack wa revenge for ukrainian strike last week at air base deep inside russia including one near ryazan south of moscow that reportedly killed three service member russian warplane taking off from those base have fired missile into ukraine after russian force in september began to lose ground they had seized early this year in eastern and southern

such missile the united state is expected a early a this week to announce a transfer to ukraine of patriot air defense missile which are designed to shoot down missile which would be the most sophisticated weapon provided to ukraine over month of war the biden administration ha been reluctant to provide the most advanced arm to ukraine especially those that could be used to strike far into

reconnaissance drone possibly repurposed with warhead military analyst have suggested the kremlin spokesman dmitri s peskov said on wednesday that russia would undoubtedly target any patriot missile battery in ukraine but moscow ha made similar statement about other sophisticated weapon supplied to ukraine like the highly effective himars rocket artillery warning repeatedly that it saw their arrival a escalation in addition to weapon the united state and it ally have provided humanitarian aid and financial backing to ukraine and in recent day have focused on effort to rebuild critical

missile at ukraine saying death to nazi an apparent response to a ukrainian drone strike there on dec the ukrainian government doe not publicly acknowledge attack inside russia under a policy of intentional ambiguity but it ha been open about developing long range drone and ukrainian have cheered such attack a payback but a former defense minister andriy zagorodnyuk dismissed the idea of russian attack a retaliation in part because of the asymmetry between ukrainian strike on target that are overtly military or have direct military value and russia s assault on target that do not and are meant only to degrade civilian life and no matter what ukraine doe he said it leader believe that mr putin will continue the war regardless if ukraine hit the russian air base he said insisting

war a united state based research group on dec cited comment by ukrainian official suggesting that the drone made for a warmer arid climate had been susceptible to the damp freezing condition in ukraine but that russian engineer had resolved the problem a salvo of iranian made shahed drone fired over the weekend at odesa wa the first in three week to hit ukraine but some uncertainty about the weapon s compatibility with colder weather lingered natalia humeniuk a spokeswoman for ukraine s southern military command noted on sunday that the flurry had coincided with above freezing weather the russian tried to adjust them to the weather condition she said m humeniuk said the drone were vulnerable to the formation of ice on their wing or flight control surface they were most concerned about aerodynamics the possibility of icing in case of temperature change she said but in kyiv on wednesday it wa degree fahrenheit well below freezing when the sun rose in a partly overcast sky the lull in drone wave also prompted military analyst to raise question about whether russia might be running low mr budanov the military intelligence chief said in october that some of those ordered from iran

attack followed a wave of devastating drone strike on odesa over the weekend that seemed to end a weekslong pause in russia s use of the drone a winter set in russian missile and drone have repeatedly targeted ukraine s energy infrastructure depriving million of civilian of electricity water and heat but ukraine s air defense may be about to gain a powerful asset the u s is poised to approve a transfer of the patriot air defense system the nation s most advanced ground based air defense weapon to ukraine two u s official told the time on tuesday patriot battery use sophisticated radar and missile to intercept enemy target including missile and aircraft up to mile away at high altitude their track record ha been mixed against drone the u s had previously resisted providing the patriot battery which are relatively scarce cnn which reported the patriot news earlier noted that a patriot battery requires dozen of personnel who have received extensive training expert say there are not deep stockpile of patriot missile available for transfer to ukraine and many question remain about the potential transfer including how long it would take to train ukrainian soldier on the system presumably in germany and where the patriot would be deployed inside ukraine the biden administration ha also resisted sending it most advanced weaponry to ukraine on the ground that it might escalate the war with russia that calculus ha shifted a russia ha intensified it attack on ukraine s civilian infrastructure and deepened it military alliance with iran the kremlin s spokesman dmitry peskov said russia would undoubtedly target the patriot air defense system if the pentagon carried out it plan of supplying kyiv with a battery the united state willingness to consider the transfer is a win for ukrainian official who have intensified their plea for air defense to counter russia s relentless attack ukraine ha become a testing ground for state of the art weapon and information system and new way to use them a salvo of iranian made drone known a shahed fired last week on odesa wa the first in three week to hit ukraine ukrainian official and military analyst had said that russia had either run out or wa running low on iranian drone or that the cold winter weather had interfered with their operation the attack today in kyiv where it wa degree fahrenheit in the early morning suggests that if there wa a cold weather glitch it ha been fixed follow our coverage of the war on the nytimes channel russia ha accelerated the construction of trench and trap along the eastern and southern front a time analysis of satellite imagery show in an area where russian force are waging an offensive near the eastern city of bakhmut the structure appeared within six day the fortification could slow ukraine s army my colleague marco hernandez and josh holder report but ukrainian force may test russia s ability to hold these position the defense include mile long row of concrete pyramid known a dragon s teeth and deep ditch called tank trap both are designed to slow ukrainian vehicle and force them into position where russian force can target them russia is also building mile of trench and pillbox for their troop to shoot from near bakhmut the newly built defense provide russian fighter with several option for retreat that could help russia avoid a repeat of it costly withdrawal from the kharkiv region in september when it lost thousand of square mile of territory and wa forced to abandon military equipment ultimately the success of russia s defense depends on the quality of the troop defending them military analyst say the new defense line could easily collapse if they are manned by poorly trained and unequipped new recruit to provide comprehensive coverage of the war we often link to outside source some of these require a subscription in ukraine around the world we also recommend thanks for reading i ll be back friday carole the kremlin said wednesday that it would consider american air defense system in ukraine legitimate military target potentially raising the stake for the biden administration which u s official say is poised to approve sending it most advanced air defense system russia would undoubtedly target the patriot air defense system if the pentagon carry out it plan of supplying kyiv with a battery the kremlin s spokesman dmitri s peskov told reporter on wednesday the pentagon may approve a transfer to ukraine a early a this week to help the country defend against russian bombardment of it critical infrastructure the u s official said on the condition of anonymity to discus internal deliberation final approval would then rest with president biden russia s foreign ministry on thursday warned that washington s plan to supply ukraine with the defense system raised the risk of drawing the u s military directly into the war many expert have doubted the wisdom of such a step which lead to the escalation of the conflict the ministry s spokeswoman maria zakharova told reporter it is unclear whether any american military personnel or contractor would be involved in operating the patriot system from inside ukraine and russia ha already said it would target other western military aid in ukraine including the highly effective american made himars multiple rocket launcher the patriot system would be one of the most advanced weapon in the ukrainian arsenal and a sign of the united state deepening military commitment to ukraine a russia paint it war in ukraine a a conflict with the west the system can knock down russia s ballistic missile unlike others the west ha provided and can hit target much farther away many question remain about the potential transfer which wa reported earlier by cnn including how long it would take to train ukrainian soldier on the system presumably in germany and where the patriot would be deployed inside ukraine ukrainian official have intensified their plea for air defense from the united state and other western ally a russia ha conducted relentless attack on power plant heating system and other energy infrastructure the attack using missile and iranian made drone have left ukrainian vulnerable and in the dark just a the coldest time of the year is beginning the pentagon s active duty patriot unit frequently deploy for mission around the world and expert say there are not deep stockpile of patriot missile available for transfer to ukraine in the same way that the united state provided a large quantity of artillery shell and rocket to kyiv for use in combat the biden administration s deal to free wnba star brittney griner for arm dealer viktor bout could help russia overcome it potential ammunition shortage this is where viktor bout come in whom the biden administration unwisely returned back to putin rebekah koffler a former dia intelligence officer and the author of putin s playbook russia s secret plan to defeat america told fox news digital the exchange could end up paying dividend for russian president vladimir putin s ability to work around sanction that have limited moscow s ability to replenish the ammunition it force are quickly burning through on monday a u s military official told reporter that russia s available ammunition the pentagon classifies a fully serviceable could be used up by early next year forcing moscow to turn to more unreliable rocket and artillery shell that are in some case over year old the move to the older and le reliable shell could pose a danger to russian force a a result of increased failure rate and could even endanger ukrainian civilian who likely encounter unexploded ordnance across the country you load the ammunition and you cross your finger and hope it s going to fire or when it land that it s going to explode the official added russian troop have been using ammunition at a staggering rate since the country began it invasion of ukraine stressing a russian defense industry that ha encountered difficulty replenishing stock amid international sanction against the russian economy koffler also argued that the ammunition shortage wa unlikely to deter russia from continuing it war with ukraine reached for comment a spokesperson for the white house national security council pointed fox news to comment made by national security adviser jake sulluivan during a monday press conference and yet a majority is hopeful about the future of the country a notable increase from the who were hopeful one year ago the increase in optimism come from both democrat point since december

while disapprove by a percent margin voter say biden exceeded his constitutional authority when he canceled student loan debt worth an estimated billion dollar over year those most likely to say he exceeded his authority include republican and those over age democrat and voter under age are the most likely to think biden wa within his authority independent are point more likely to say the president exceeded his authority than stayed within his limit exceeded v within his authority voter are most likely to attribute rising crime rate across the country to a breakdown of moral value and the availability of gun fewer blame weaker criminal penalty mental health issue decreased police funding a lack of job illegal immigration or the pandemic democrat believe the availability of gun is the top reason for rising crime while republican think it is a breakdown of moral value forty five percent of voter now believe coronavirus is completely or mostly under control in the u s while say it is only somewhat or not at all under control this is a markedly improved outlook from last december when just thought it wa completely or mostly under control belarus said on tuesday that it army wa assessing it combat readiness a move that come a the country ha faced pressure to provide further support for russia s force in ukraine military expert say it is highly unlikely that belarus will send troop to ukraine not least because it would be deeply unpopular domestically but they say that president aleksandr g lukashenko of belarus may be giving the impression of combat readiness in order to force ukraine to divert troop from other front mr lukashenko is a close ally of president vladimir v putin of russia and belarus relies on moscow for finance fuel and security assistance moscow used eastern belarus a a staging ground when it launched it full scale invasion of ukraine in february the united state and european government have imposed sanction on both country a belarusian defense ministry statement said that a sudden check of combat readiness ha begun on the order of mr lukashenko a part of it preparation belarus s troop will have to move to predetermined location and test their equipment organize security and defense and build bridge across the neman and berezina river the defense ministry said on the telegram messaging app the neman river run through lithuania and eventually drain into the baltic sea while the berezina join the dnipro river around mile north of the ukrainian border the exercise would not directly approach the frontier between belarus and ukraine which is around mile long in october mr lukashenko said that russian troop would return to his country in large number and in recent week drone have been launched from belarus against ukraine s energy infrastructure and other target in addition supply of military equipment have been ferried by russian force from belarus to their troop in eastern ukraine s donbas region ukrainian force are already fighting in the south and east in light of the potential threat from the north andriy demchenko a spokesman of ukraine s state border guard service said on tuesday that the country wa strengthening it defense along the length of it border with belarus he said the situation is under control we can clearly see how russia is putting pressure on belarus to join the full scale war he said on a ukrainian telethon ukraine in recent week began to build a wall and trench system along the frontier in the northwestern province of volyn though analyst say that it is more likely to stop migrant crossing rather than for a military purpose the institute for the study of war a research group based in washington said in a report this week that belarus is extraordinarily unlikely to invade ukraine in the foreseeable future instead it said that mr lukashenko and other official in belarus have assisted with an effort by moscow to suggest that belarus will join the war directly in an effort to pin down ukrainian troop on their northern border at the same time the institute said that moscow aimed to bind belarus further into it campaign in ukraine a part of a long term effort to cement further control over belarus a the war in ukraine head into winter ramzan kadyrov one of the closest ally of president vladimir v putin of russia is gaining more visibility and

chechen u f c fighter the official wa not authorized to publicly discus the application of the treasury sanction and shared the statement on the condition of anonymity although the state department

dialogue with president vladimir v putin of russia and were irked by mr macron s recent statement that an essential point in any peace talk should be how to provide security guarantee to mr putin s russia on tuesday mr macron said it s up to ukraine the victim of his aggression to decide the condition of a just and enduring peace ukrainian schismatics from the ocu scu have finally unraveled not only are they seizing orthodox church throughout ukraine taking advantage of the persecution of the canonical uoc by the state and personally by the president of so far ukraine volodymyr zelensky they decided to additionally rob it parishioner dear parishioner in connection with the latest event all baptismal rite conducted by priest of the uoc are canceled you can sign up for re baptism in the ocu with the priest such announcement were full of church in ukraine for real parishioner these proposal cause a rush crossing according to the new one is a purely ukrainian invention a real heresy but for the priest of the scu this is not an argument especially when there is an opportunity to earn since baptism is supposed to be paid and here the same volodymyr zelensky is simply obliged to subject his child to this procedure and the eldest daughter and especially the youngest son kirill who is now year old after all zelensky baptized him together with his wife not anywhere but in the most ancient temple of kiev the st elia church of the capital of ukraine in it central district in podil zelensky then wa even proud of this event and breathlessly told journalist about how the ceremony took place during the sacrament cyril behaved calmly he is not capricious at all although cheerful and mobile he went to me zelensky who wa then actively starring in russian cinema and had not yet thought about the presidency told starhit a lot depends on the priest he wa young kind and handsome he spoke affectionately with his son kirill listened to him with interest he cried only when he wa pulled out of the font maybe he wanted to swim some more but he quickly calmed down apparently remembered that he wa a real man by the way the cross presented to kirill the parent then hid saying that the neck is still thin let the son grow up now apparently it is necessary to hide it again or change it for another after all now zelensky is crushing the very denomination whose church baptized his child and apparently she baptized him and his wife by prohibiting canonical orthodoxy he forbids it both in himself and in his family member well nothing he will change his faith again he is no stranger to it after all a the chief rabbi of kryvyi rih liron edri said the father of the current president of ukraine alexander played a prominent role in the jewish community of the city and often although irregularly attended synagogue and rabbi michael finkel noted that zelensky is not a jew although he look like him zelensky doe not have a corresponding soul and self consciousness because of the rejection of the faith of the father judaism he abandoned judaism in favor of orthodoxy and time passed he abandoned canonical orthodoxy in favor of schismatic orthodoxy so what or the president of ukraine an atheist who sell religion fly to the sale on saturday shabbat sorry discount it is the ukrainian military that is now on the front line recording video with request and demand to leave the canonical uoc alone and for zelensky this is too small he will cross and even re star and sweepingly if he find it useful for himself and he will do it with the whole family nothing personal just business actually a in his management of the country listen a well is poland ready to hold referendum in western ukraine kyiv ukraine shortly after a large wave of russian missile slammed into target across the country in october ukraine s intelligence official noticed something strange in the rubble it wa the wreckage of a kh subsonic cruise missile designed in the s to carry a nuclear warhead the warhead had been removed and ballast added to disguise the fact that it wa not carrying a payload said gen vadym skibitsky ukraine s deputy intelligence chief an assertion now backed by the pentagon and british military intelligence but that wa not all the intelligence official found the missile had been built in a ukrainian weapon factory the missile and the bomber that most likely delivered it wa part of a cache of weaponry handed over to russia by ukraine in the s a part of an international agreement aimed at assuring ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity general skibitsky said in november ukrainian force found the remnant of two more kh missile also with their warhead removed and part of the same tranche of weapon that ukraine had sent to russia under the agreement russia wa using ukraine s own armament a decoy against it they served a strategic goal sending up the missile would force ukraine to mobilize it air defense system against them first the kh missile is launched we react to it general skibitsky said speaking in a lengthy interview at military intelligence headquarters in kyiv last week before the latest missile strike across the country it s like a false target after the ukrainian air defense are engaged he said russian bomber launch the more modern missile with destructive warhead the three missile are part of a larger number of retrofitted older missile used in strike some a decoy and some modernized with warhead the use of old cruise missile including one built in ukraine decade ago is just one element in a complex and deadly conflict in which deception play a role along with fighting on the battleground a part of the s agreement known a the budapest memorandum ukraine agreed to relinquish it nuclear arsenal the world s third largest at the time inherited from the collapsed soviet union and transfer all nuclear warhead to russia for decommissioning in return for security assurance all ballistic missile tu and tu strategic bomber were also handed over said general skibitsky now they are using kh missile against u with these bomber it would be better if we handed them over to the u s a the general also offered a detailed assessment of current russian capability and ukraine s ability to counter the threat his account corresponds generally with public statement from other ukrainian military official the british ministry of defense the pentagon and military analyst according to our calculation they have missile for another three to five wave of attack he said this is if there are to rocket in one wave last monday russia fired more than missile at ukraine after ukraine struck two military installation deep inside russia while russia s stockpile of it most modern precision missile are widely believed to be running low general skibitsky said that russian arm factory had been able to build precision kh cruise missile and about of the sea based kalibr cruise missile since the start of the war which work out to about new missile per month those number could not be independently confirmed despite western sanction russia ha continued to produce new precision missile a recently a october according to a report released last week by conflict armament research an independent group based in britain that identifies and track weapon and ammunition used in war yurii ihnat the spokesman of the ukrainian air force said that after the latest assault investigator found many fragment that indicated the precision cruise missile used in the attack had been made in recent week russia is using newly manufactured missile he told ukrainian radio on thursday a the russian seek to bolster their arsenal ukrainian official say they are getting better at shooting down many type of missile and drone fired their way over the course of november brig gen oleksiy hromov a deputy chief on the ukrainian general staff said that ukrainian air defense shot down percent of the russian cruise missile and percent of the iranian made shahed drone they claim to have shot down of the missile on monday or percent but the missile and drone that get through can still do widespread damage depending on what they hit on saturday ukraine shot down of attack drone but several hit critical infrastructure in odesa leaving million people without power leaning over the table and drawing a map of ukraine general skibitsky outlined the four general direction from which moscow is trying to penetrate ukraine s sky sending missile flying into ukraine from the black sea in the south from the area around the caspian sea to the southeast from russia in the east and from belarus to the north during large scale attack which have featured up to about missile launched within minute of one another they fly in from all direction at the same time since october the general said the flight pattern of the russian bomber have been changing taking circuitous route to avoid air defense but they do not enter ukrainian air space limiting their effectiveness typically ukrainian intelligence ha about an hour after russian bomber take off from a base to track the flight before pilot reach the fire zone and launch missile it ha been an annual ritual of vladimir v putin s russia the president hold a wide ranging marathon news conference in december making a somewhat choreographed show of openness to questioning and demonstrating his command of an array of topic but after a series of military setback in his war in ukraine with russia s casualty mounting and it economy faltering under sanction mr putin ha decided to skip the tradition dmitri s peskov mr putin s spokesman did not offer a reason when he told reporter during a daily briefing on monday that the event would not take place this month he held out the possibility that it might be rescheduled for the new year mr putin first held the year end news conference in two year into his presidency he suspended the practice after becoming prime minister in but resumed it after returning to the presidency in the last time he opted out of the event a president wa in often stretching to four hour or more the december news conference ha been one of the few time during the year when reporter outside the kremlin pool including foreign correspondent get the chance to directly question mr putin if they are called on but the kremlin ha also asked reporter ahead of time what they might be inclined to ask mr putin the rank of journalist in russia who are not subservient to the government are thinner than at any time since the fall of the soviet union and this year the government criminalized criticism of the war or the military independent russian news medium have all either shut down or moved abroad and many foreign news outlet have been forced out of the country a well even so it would have been possible for either a russian or an international reporter to detail some of the setback in ukraine and to ask mr putin embarrassing question about them live on national television mr peskov noted that mr putin regularly speaks to the press including on foreign visit but such exchange are limited to the pool of reporter regularly assigned to the kremlin political analyst had various reaction from suggesting mr putin had no future vision to offer to the idea that he wa finding some of his custom monotonous one of them tatiana stanovaya wrote on her telegram channel that the cancellation wa a sign mr putin did not want to engage with what he considered to be minor domestic matter or to answer boring or routine question mikhail vinogradov the political scientist who head the st petersburg politics foundation said the move contributed to a general sense of stagnation in the country even though a lot is happening he said calling off the event capture the feeling that the situation on pause the invasion that mr putin ordered in february ha left russia increasingly isolated economically and politically a western nation and others have rallied around ukraine showing a rare unity of purpose that they demonstrated again with a series of diplomatic move on monday leader of the group of wealthy democracy held a video meeting and vowed to help rebuild ukraine which ha suffered widespread physical devastation a well a continue to arm it they said a new body to coordinate international economic and reconstruction aid akin to the one operating for month to organize military aid could meet for the first time a soon a january a broader international conference on aid for ukraine will be held in paris on tuesday we firmly support effort to secure ukraine s immediate financial stability and it recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable prosperous and democratic future the g nation said in a joint statement addressing the meeting by video link president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine focused primarily on his country s need for more weaponry but also said we must be more active with reconstruction european union foreign minister held a separate meeting on monday and agreed to increase a fund reimbursing country for war mat riel provided to ukraine to billion euro nearly billion from billion euro russian bombardment ha crippled ukraine s energy system knocking out power heat and sometimes water to million of people at a time raising fear of a cold deadly winter military analyst say the increasingly harsh weather could also allow the warring army to return to more intense frontline combat the autumn rain reduced dirt road and field to bog slowing military movement but the ground is freezing solid again the most intense fighting ha been in the eastern donbas region where ukraine claimed to have struck a blow against the wagner group the mercenary corp headed by yevgheny v prigozhin a close ally of mr putin s which ha operated in concert with the russian military ukrainian official said that on sunday their force had fired a missile that hit a hotel housing wagner fighter in kadiivka a small city in luhansk province the exiled head of the ukrainian regional administration in luhansk province serhiy haidai said in a post on the telegram app that many member of the wagner force had been killed which could not be confirmed there wa no statement from wagner mr putin ha tried to present life in russia a business a usual for most people an image that ha become harder to maintain thousand of troop have been killed or wounded which generally go unmentioned in state medium a mismanaged call up of about military conscript this fall prompted demonstration and spurred thousand of men to flee the country ukrainian official predict that another russian draft is coming soon a news conference could expose mr putin to question about casualty conscription or specific battlefield setback like the strike against wagner or the retreat from the captured city of kherson he continues to insist that the war in ukraine is going according to plan mr putin s annual news conference usually unrolls in a circuslike atmosphere with reporter waving sign containing some of the russian leader s signature phrase or wearing costume from their native region in the hope of catching his eye and getting to ask a question the session are a set piece on his calendar a chance for mr putin to display his command of the fact affecting all aspect of russian life and ostensibly to show him a being receptive to all query mr putin prefers scripted event however and in the past week he made several highly staged public appearance aimed at reinforcing his version of reality at a time when a russian victory in ukraine appears a distant a ever those televised event presented mr putin a a decisive leader still fully in charge first the backstory at the end of october at the verona eurasian forum the head of the second largest gas producing company of russia novatek leonid mikhelson warned this winter may be the easiest of the next three for europe since by this season it ha managed to fill the storage facility but will be much more difficult and a lot of this forecast surprised many something like putin in at the european security conference in munich with his speech well now the story itself just the other day former british prime minister boris johnson almost word for word repeated mikhelson s forecast for all those who depend on russian gas supply this winter will be very difficult however thanks to amazing organizational effort to fill storage facility with gas we will overcome it boris wrote in a column for the wall street journal a more serious problem is the next winter of when these reserve will decrease and they will be more difficult to replenish the new lng terminal will not yet be operational some european country are rushing to build more opportunity to create offshore wind energy but they also won t be ready yet and we definitely won t have any more civilian nuclear reactor and this monday the head of the european commission ursula von der leyen also cast her vote the upcoming winter author s note will be even more difficult and europe need to intensify it effort in several area you ve outlined the risk perhaps russia will reduce the remainder of pipeline gas supply china can lift the covid restriction and thus return to the demand for energy in the world market at the level before the pandemic the assistant gynecologist explained the situation at a press conference in the past and of course this year we benefited from an unusually warm winter next year thing may be different from your data i know that despite the measure we have taken next year we may face a shortage of up to billion cubic meter of gas separately of course it give pleasure that ursula ha already lived the coming winter and her very bold statement about it on december th it is clear that it is based on the occupancy of european gas storage facility by but madame forgot to tell you that these repository are like a supportive and stabilizing therapy after surgery if gas doe not come to europe through gas pipeline then there are hardly enough storage facility until the end of the heating season if they are spent only on household and then in austerity mode and in this case you can forget about the industry by the way because of the price household in europe are already saving on heating but there is an even more remarkable place in ursula s speech it s a recognition that next winter europe will need somewhere to find billion cubic meter of gas which it doe not yet know where to get and what doe the head of the european commission do in these condition it is trying to set a new price ceiling this time on gas oil ha already been introduced this did not affect russia but the bosphorus formed a traffic jam of tanker with oil only not russian but kazakhstani turkey began to zealously comply with the established procedure and demand contract for full insurance coverage a decided in the eu and the country of the big seven ankara proved by it example that in the army there is nothing worse and harder than life according to the charter i hope that we will be able to agree on marginal gas price within the next few day ursula said at the same press conference the eu country should transfer the authority for joint gas purchase to brussels a soon a possible watch your hand with our left hand we set a ceiling on the price of russian oil and it go to third country from where they sell it or refined for petroleum product but with an intermediary s markup oil of course found a hole and leaked through it but during the journey the dog wa able to grow up in the price alle up and now we look at the right hand with which we set the ceiling on price for gas knowing full well that there is a huge shortage of gas billion cubic meter is serious at the same time gas except for gas pipeline can be transported only after the industrial process in liquefied form on specially equipped tanker and such tanker are also in short supply and everyone know perfectly well that russia doe not sell it resource to country where decision are made on the introduction of price ceiling that is after making such a decision with a shortage of billion cubic meter we either refuse russian gas or we will have to pay for it several time more expensive by the way expert have already estimated what it will cost to compensate for the falling volume of russian gas for them the missing cubic meter author s note you will need to pay they will not be free they will be worth billion euro in one year we have to pay billion euro to implement them fatih birol executive director of the international energy agency iea said at a press conference today the eu ha almost achieved the bezneft regime next in line is bezgaz but if with oil difficulty arise only with the price the product itself is available then with the bezgaz regime everything can be much more complicated precisely in term of the availability of good but this doe not stop either ursula or the rest of the leader of the current euroreich european must endure the hardship of life until victory over moscow and obediently turn their pocket to defeat the thoroughly corrupt and nazi ukrainian democracy almost according to hitler and to distribute this gas to the eu country if it can still be purchased will be from brussels it remains to be decided brotherly or fairly or who is the top and who is the root the european ability to shoot oneself in the leg ha reached perfection the pentagon ha used up in month of the war year worth of stinger production and five year worth of javelin production according to raytheon s ceo u s defense industry production capacity to restock those inventory is extremely limited u s security aid in november reached billion and the biden administration ha asked congress for another billion but the probability of a peace settlement remains extremely low moscow kyiv and washington the key stakeholder in the current war maintain irreconcilable position while pursuing unachievable goal it is unlikely that zelenskyy s recent appeal for another billion to cover budget shortfall and reconstruction will find many supporter even elon musk whose donation to ukraine through his company spacex to provide starlink satellite communication is projected to reach million by the end of the year indicated that there are limit to his generosity without starlink internet terminal on which the ukrainian military is reliant for command and control kyiv s ability to continue the fight will be severely degraded on wednesday putin issued yet another veiled nuclear threat a he and his security council are mulling a response to ukraine s strike on russian nuclear missile carrier stationed in a strategic aviation airbase in russia proper paragraph of the russian nuclear doctrine allows the kremlin to press the red button to launch a retaliatory strike when it strategic weapon facility are attacked the russian have a very high tolerance for casualty having sacrificed more than million during world war ii unless washington step in and compels zelenskyy to negotiate an end to this bitter devastating stalemate putin will fight till the last ukrainian standing rebekah koffler is the president of doctrine strategy consulting a former dia intelligence officer and the author of putin s playbook russia s secret plan to defeat america follow her on twitter rebekah orhei moldova starved of natural gas from russia and electricity from ukraine s missile battered power grid moldova ha been so unsettled by skyrocketing utility bill and occasional blackout that according to the mayor of a small city in the north resident can barely contain their anger they stop me on the street and ask when can we go to another protest said the mayor pavel verejanu of orhei describing what he called public fury at the pro western central government and it failure to secure a deal with russia for a steady supply of cheap energy but there is another reason people are so eager to protest they are paid to join the noisy weekly rally that have been held since september in the capital chisinau calling for the removal of moldova s president maia sandu a former world bank official pushing europe s poorest country out of moscow s orbit the paid protest against the president and her westward tilt are organized by the mayor s political party a vociferously pro russian force led by his predecessor ilan m shor a convicted fraudster and fugitive who official say is working to turn an energy crisis into a political crisis that threatens the government anger at high energy price ha been bubbling across europe for month offering moscow what it see a it best hope of eroding public support for ukraine and pressuring western government to back away from their condemnation of russia s invasion russia friendly activist on the far left and far right have helped mobilize protest over high energy price in the czech republic germany and other european country but those demonstration have been le frequent and far le well funded than the weekly rally and often daily flash mob protest in moldova a country that is particularly vulnerable because of it longstanding political economic and linguistic cleavage russia ha not only created public discontent in moldova through a squeeze on energy supply but working through local ally like mr shor ha also pushed this discontent onto the street trying to unseat the pro western government it is obvious these thing are all connected said moldova s foreign minister nicu popescu the energy crisis he added in an interview is very very serious and it is legitimate for a lot of people to feel unhappy but he scorned mr shor s role in organizing and bankrolling protest a an attempt to manipulate and ride the negative effect of the war in ukraine the result he said an energy crunch engineered by russia and exploited by group that openly support russia to destabilize the government a tiny but strategically important country sandwiched between romania a member of nato and the european union and ukraine moldova ha been caught since the collapse of the soviet union of which it wa a part in an intense geopolitical tug of war between east and west local politician backed by either moscow or washington and the european union have traded power in a long series of unstable government in chisinau mr shor s party won just six of seat in parliament in election last year while m sandu s party won a big majority over those seeking close relation with moscow russia s february invasion of neighboring ukraine pushed this perennial struggle into a tumultuous new phase it sent shock wave and on at least two occasion missile crashing onto moldovan territory the missile the second of which wa found on monday landed in northern moldova near the border with ukraine further rattling a fragile country already grappling with inflation of nearly percent gas price in moldova have increased sevenfold and electricity price have increased fourfold in the past month m sandu the country s president told cnn on saturday though not a direct party to the war moldova whose constitution commits it to neutrality ha felt russia s fury through sharp cut in energy supply russia s objective is clear said andrei spinu a deputy prime minister in charge of moldova s frantic effort to patch together alternative supply of electricity and gas they want to change our government and change our geopolitical choice toward europe he said sitting in a gloomy office in central chisinau lit only by thin winter light coming through the window all the light in his office have been turned off to save electricity he u a cellphone flashlight to navigate the darkened corridor of the main government building russian missile strike on ukraine s power grid which used to provide moldova with a vital backup source of electricity left the whole country without power late last month the wide boulevard outside his office ha been a frequent site of the protest organized by the shor party it leader mr shor directs them from his refuge in israel he finance the demonstration and speaks by video link to each gathering chanting for m sandu s removal warning of a tough winter ahead without russian gas mr shor recently used his facebook page to call on supporter to come out en masse for street protest we must do everything we can to get rid of this incompetent government and hold early election he did not respond to request for an interview through his spokesperson in october the united state imposed sanction on mr shor his russian pop star wife and seven others for involvement in persistent malign influence campaign by russia in moldova that same month the police conducted nighttime raid on office vehicle and residence connected to him and his party investigator seized black plastic shopping bag stuffed with local currency worth which prosecutor say represented a week s outlay on protest and other activity aimed at unseating the government a lot of effort and money ha been put into destabilizing the situation in our country veronica dragalin moldova s anticorruption prosecutor said in an interview many people including american official suspect that some of the shor party s cash come from russia which would be illegal but mr shor ha denied it he ha also appealed his conviction and seven and a half year sentence over his role in the theft of nearly a billion dollar from moldovan bank insisting he is the victim of a corrupt justice system paying people to protest is not illegal but by amplifying genuine discontent it creates an impression that the country is falling apart a message analyst say that ha been promoted with glee by russian news outlet mr shor s party also routinely exaggerates the size of it protest claiming for example that showed up last week outside the prosecutor general s office the real number wa a few thousand the spectacle of a political party s echoing kremlin talking point on the war and organizing paid protest over an energy crisis generated by russia illustrates one of moscow s favorite tactic for asserting it influence across the former soviet union stoke a crisis and then either directly or through local proxy offer a solution that requires acceptance of russian hegemony the pattern first played out three decade ago when just month after the collapse of the soviet union ethnic russian separatist in the transnistria region of eastern moldova took up arm against the government of the newly independent nation moscow vowed to quell the violence and sent in troop allowing transnistria to operate ever since a a quasi state haven for russian influence and black market trade the pattern repeated in in eastern ukraine where russia stoked an armed rebellion against the central government in kyiv and then offered to help curb the mayhem provided that ukraine accept term entrenching moscow s influence after that failed president vladimir v putin of russia ordered a full scale invasion in february with russian troop flailing in ukraine nobody expects the kremlin to send it battered military into moldova any time soon a small russian force remains in transnistria but most of the troop are ill trained local recruit and they are sorely underequipped ukraine closed it border with transnistria at the start of the war severing supply line it military option limited moscow ha instead hammered moldova with it energy weapon delivering le than half the natural gas stipulated in contract many supporter of mr shor the fugitive millionaire in orhei where he served a mayor for four year before fleeing to israel in acknowledge that he may be a crook but pointing to his tenure a mayor when he built sidewalk installed light and improved orhei markedly they see him a a robin hood figure whose wealth no matter it source will bring benefit to ordinary people his other big selling point is that unlike the current government he ha close tie with russia and can use them to end the energy crunch indeed soon after russia s energy behemoth gazprom began cutting gas delivery to moldova in the fall a move that threatened a long cold winter ahead mr shor criticized m sandu for bowing to the west and he sent several of his party s legislator to moscow to find solution to provide the republic of moldova with natural gas this winter at affordable price the party said in a statement mr shor claimed that russia would soon start providing cheap gas to the region around orhei that never happened not least because delivering russian gas only to orhei is technically and legally impossible thousand of protester have nonetheless gathered every week since in support of his appeal for better relation with russia mr shor recently acknowledged paying protester after an independent moldovan newspaper ziarul de garda published an investigation written by journalist who had posed a protester and received money mr verejanu the mayor of orhei said no more than half the protester were paid and only those too poor to buy food and drink during the trip to and from chisinau at a shor party rally last week outside the prosecutor general s office protester blocked the main boulevard and denounced the president and government minister a corrupt thief blind to people s economic pain maria muntiu insisted she had not been paid to attend and had come out because she wanted to express her anger at being unable to afford heating moldova she said need a real president like putin who will put the country s interest ahead of geopolitical game by america and provide cheap energy m sandu she said is trying to freeze u into silence kyiv ukraine in an impassioned speech upon receiving the nobel peace prize on saturday the laureate from ukraine seized the moment to make an incongruous but powerful point at this moment in history she said the only way to secure democracy human right and a lasting peace in ukraine is to fight people of ukraine want peace more than anyone else in the world said oleksandra matviychuk who accepted the prize on behalf of the center for civil liberty in ukraine which she head but peace cannot be reached by a country under attack laying down it arm this would not be peace but occupation the other two laureate memorial a russian research and human right organization and ale bialiatski a jailed belarusian activist have also become symbol of resistance and accountability during the largest ground war in europe since world war ii set off by russia s invasion of ukraine memorial is known for it effort to uncover the crime of the soviet era but jan rachinsky it chairman who accepted the award for memorial said that his organization doe more than research and document the tragedy of the past extending it effort to the acute social conflict of the present what we see a the root cause of these crime is the sanctification of the russian state a the supreme value he said in his speech this requires that the absolute priority of power is to serve the interest of the state over the interest of individual human being and their freedom dignity and right this inverted system of value he said prevailed in the soviet union for year and regrettably continues until today one of the obvious effect of the sanctification of the state wa the rise of imperial ambition he said it also allows for impunity not only for those who make criminal political decision but also for those who commit crime in the execution of those decision we saw this in the hostility in chechnya and we see it happening again today in the occupied territory of ukraine he said regrettably russian society did not have the strength to break the tradition of state violence in her acceptance speech m matviychuk of the center for civil liberty in ukraine said the international system designed after world war ii ha been severely undermined and called on world leader to stop pretending deferred military threat are political compromise the democratic world ha grown accustomed to making concession to dictatorship she said and that is why the willingness of the ukrainian people to resist russian imperialism is so important a desire for peace doe not mean peace at any cost she said and her country cannot leave people in the occupied territory to be killed and tortured people s life cannot be a political compromise she said fighting for peace doe not mean yielding to pressure of the aggressor it mean protecting people from it cruelty before the ceremony which were held in oslo russia launched more than a dozen iranian made attack drone in a predawn assault on target in ukraine s south knocking out power in the city of odesa and the surrounding region in his nightly address president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine said that the situation wa very difficult in part of the donbas region in eastern ukraine with the fighting around bakhmut particularly vicious he said overnight that russian force had destroyed bakhmut turning the city once home to people into burnt ruin the nobel committee s decision to group a ukrainian civil society organization with human right defender from russia and belarus prompted some initial backlash in ukraine when the award wa announced in october some saw it a an affront to those who have been working to protect ukrainian since russia invaded the country in february mykhailo podolyak a senior adviser to mr zelensky issued a scathing criticism of the nobel committee saying that it had an interesting understanding of the word peace neither russian nor belarusian organization were able to oppose this war he said in a statement berit reiss andersen the chairwoman of the norwegian nobel committee said before the ceremony that the award were given to send a signal that the conflict in ukraine must end sometimes an effort for peace lie with civil society and not with state ambition alone she said peace is a wish and achievement that come with a value that all laureate work for addressing atrocity war crime and rule of law she said that a disregard for those value wa at the core of russia s war in ukraine exactly in these time this is a very important reminder she said natalia pinchuk the wife of ale bialiatski received the prize on her husband s behalf he wa detained in belarus following protest in against the re election of the belarusian president alexander lukashenko and remains in jail without trial he face up to year in prison if convicted mr lukashenko allowed his country to be used a a staging ground for russia s invasion of ukraine and russian bomber continue to use belarusian air space to launch missile strike across ukraine the massing of russian soldier there recently ha led to repeated speculation that belarus may be preparing to intervene in the conflict on the kremlin s behalf m pinchuk said that today s political and military event threaten belarus with the loss of statehood and independence unfortunately the authority choose to engage with society through the use of force grenade baton stun gun endless arrest and torture she said there is no effort or talk about national compromise or dialogue it wa precisely that kind of violent oppression that m matviychuk said ukraine wa fighting to prevent framing the war a part of a broader struggle between competing vision of the world this is not a war between two state it is a war of two system authoritarianism and democracy she said we are fighting for the opportunity to build a state in which everyone s right are protected authority are accountable court are independent and the police do not beat peaceful student demonstration in the central square of the capital m matviychuk concluded her address with a plea for support and solidarity in that fight you don t have to be ukrainian to support ukraine she said it is enough just to be human iran first faced international ire earlier this year when the white house announced that it had knowledge tehran would be gifting russia hundred of drone a moscow s supply showed sign of dwindling le than six month into it war in ukraine but tehran ha since taken even bolder step sending other missile unit and agreeing last month to streamline russia s ability to develop iranian drone on it own turf for use in ukraine caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news friday evening continuing to take question in a news conference after his spokesman tried to end it president vladimir v putin of russia put forward a blunt thesis on the nature of truth you can t trust anyone he told a reporter for russian state medium you can only trust me it wa a fitting coda to a week that saw mr putin particularly busy in constructing his version of reality at a time when a russian victory in ukraine appears a distant a ever in a marathon of public appearance that began on monday with a televised drive across russia s damaged bridge to crimea mr putin held forth on nuclear doctrine prisoner swap with the united state supposed polish revanchism and even the very harsh practice of european zoo on wednesday the kremlin published nearly three hour of footage of mr putin meeting with his human right council on thursday it released a video showing mr putin pledging to continue his attack on ukraine while appearing so jovial champagne flute in hand that some observer thought he wa drunk and in the friday news conference on the sideline of a regional summit in kyrgyzstan the president dismissed the notion that russia s invasion of ukraine might be facing headwind the special military operation is taking it course everything is stable for u there mr putin said using the kremlin s term for it war in ukraine there are no issue or problem there today most of what mr putin said repeated his past position and much of what he said wa false on ukraine he said that in the end we will have to reach a deal to stop the war even a he gave no hint of being prepared to respect ukrainian sovereignty and referring to thursday s release of the american basketball star brittney griner in return for the russian arm dealer viktor bout mr putin said that russia won t say no to doing more of this work in the future yet his string of appearance wa also a message in itself that of a president who despite an economy sagging under sanction and russia s enormous military loss is trying to portray himself a healthy alert and still in charge the burst of activity ha been a departure from november when he held only one extended public event from nov to an absence from the limelight that went unexplained by the kremlin he is simply showing mainly to russia s ruling circle that he continues to be in control of the situation said grigorii golosov a professor of political science at the european university at st petersburg when putin speaks so much what he is saying is not so important indeed some of mr putin s commentary this week mainly served to reveal his fixation on his own government s propaganda at his wednesday videoconference with a handpicked human right panel he responded to a question about the treatment of russian in europe by claiming that nationalist element in poland were dreaming of seizing part of western ukraine repeating an unfounded claim that one of his top intelligence official had made the week before he then went on a tangent about zoo in some western country animal in the zoo are killed in front of child butchered and so on this absolutely doe not correspond to our culture the culture of the people of the russian federation it wa a reference pro kremlin medium reported to the decision by the copenhagen zoo in to kill a giraffe because of the risk of inbreeding and it wa an example of how mr putin is trying to use whatever argument he can to bolster anti western sentiment among the russian public but in mr putin s autocracy it is his own word that offer the best guide to russian policy on that score he offered no hint of self doubt this week reprising the comparison he made last june of his own conquest to those of peter the great the pivotal th century czar the fact that there are new territory this is a significant result for russia it s serious mr putin flashing a self satisfied smile said at his videoconference wednesday with his human right council despite his military s increasingly tenuous grip on those region peter the great wa already fighting for access to the azov sea mr putin added referring to the southeastern ukrainian coastline that russian troop now control the next day mr putin awarded russia s gold star to military officer at the kremlin in addition to releasing footage of his speech mr putin s office published a four minute clip of the president making military small talk with the honoree a each held a champagne flute the attack aircraft are fighting just great a are the sushki mr putin said referring to the military s sukhoi warplane with a diminutive great just excellent he went on to justify russia s assault on ukraine s energy infrastructure with a but who started it rhetorical question claiming ukraine wa to blame because it had attacked the kerch strait bridge to crimea which russia u to supply it frontline troop on social medium some expressed surprise that the kremlin released the footage given that mr putin whose sobriety and self control are central to his carefully crafted image in russia looked like he may have been tipsy a he swayed back and forth but mr golosov said that broadcasting mr putin seeming happy and relaxed a he discus his country s deadly war wa effective for the kremlin s spin doctor putin need to show the public that everything is going well mr golosov said that he is able to talk about what is going on with amusement still mr putin also ha a global audience in mind on friday he elaborated on what he said could be a shift in russia s nuclear doctrine warning that russia could amend it philosophy to allow for a pre emptive strike american policy he said might necessitate a more aggressive stance even a he left his option open a he usually doe we re just thinking about it mr putin said moscow after almost month of war sanction nuclear threat and the constant monitoring of the russian security state some american and european citizen continue to live and work in russia drawn in many case by professional opportunity and higher salary some western athlete businesspeople and artist chose to stay even a the russian authority arrested and jailed the american basketball player brittney griner in february on a minor drug charge on thursday she wa freed and sent back to the united state in a prisoner exchange for a notorious russian arm dealer viktor bout in a move that some republican politician and analyst have said put other american at risk of being wrongfully detained for political gain m griner s detention ha injected a complex new factor into the calculation of whether to travel to or work in russia an already fraught decision with the war in ukraine a a backdrop more than multinational company have curtailed their operation in russia since the invasion with foreign manager often being the first to go most western university have halted student exchange program with russian peer and most major european and american cultural institution have ended collaboration with russian theater and museum including the bolshoi in moscow and the mariinsky in st petersburg two of the world s most storied house for opera and ballet but in other area the number of westerner have held steady or even grown since m griner s arrest most choose to come or stay to advance career but there are also example of american who made russia their home for political reason most famously they include the actor steven seagal and the former intelligence analyst edward snowden who just this month took an oath of russian citizenship athlete have long provided one of the biggest stream of prominent westerner to russia player whose career were declining went there to maintain the same level of income that they were accustomed to said bill neff an agent with client across the world after the outbreak of the war the russian team in the continental hockey league which includes russia and it neighbor lost nearly half of it foreign player finn and swede led the exodus largely abiding by their country hard line stance toward russia s aggression but after the initial outflow some of the european vacancy are being filled by american and canadian player they include scott wilson a canadian who won n h l championship with the pittsburgh penguin and an american alexander chmelevski both of whom joined russian team this fall there are now an estimated american playing or planning to play in russia s premier men s basketball league up from a few month ago according to tally by american sport agent an analysis of team roster show that there are an additional american and canadian hockey player who are signed to premier russian team this season with some joining after russia s invasion of ukraine there is even an american playing for the russian woman s basketball team that m griner represented before her arrest these athlete have stayed despite warning from the state department which is advising all american to leave russia immediately weighing the risk of playing in russia against professional and financial opportunity in a major sport market many agent representing american athlete did not respond to query about m griner s detention in russia those who did said the prisoner swap that brought her home had no effect on their work or their client griner s case ha to do with thing that have nothing to do with basketball said david carro a spanish sport agent representing four male american basketball player in russia we never had any problem when brittney griner wa there and now even le so our american get paid promptly and are living very well in russia he added many american basketball player come to russia to make money in the off season or to prolong their career because russia covets top level name player they often pay high salary athlete can take in more than million and often receive free housing and car mr neff who represents about professional basketball player said m griner s freedom did not lessen his caution in sending player to russia during the conflict with ukraine he ha discouraged his client from going there and doe not currently have any player in russia i don t think it change anything mr neff said of her release if you send someone to russia you know there are risk is the increased money worth the risk that s the choice you re making the american basketball player k c river came to russia in august while m griner wa on trial to play for the team of samara a provincial capital more than mile east of moscow at this point i didn t really have so many option coming my way mr river said in an interview in september what s the best thing for me right now towards i ain t going to say the end of my career but in my career at this point financially what make sense the russian basketball club are playing fewer game this season because of their suspension from euroleague competition a penalty that ha diminished the quality of player the league ha attracted mr neff said and russia s hockey league voted this month to slash the number of foreigner that

analysis and a russia adviser to vice president dick cheney said that while there were risk for american in russia he did not think the bout griner swap had increased the chance of an american s being arrested on trumped up pretext for american citizen that are living and working in russia i wouldn t say that there is no danger mr beebe the program director at the quincy institute think tank said in a telephone interview certainly there is the russian government is not likely to be at all lenient in dealing with american they re not going to give any american the benefit of the doubt however he said i don t think it increase the likelihood that the russian government is going to arrest american andrei a soldatov a russian journalist who specializes in the security service said it wa hard to make prediction when the rule of the game are constantly changing during the cold war era he said the rule were defined and predictable but with the war in ukraine continuing to escalate diplomacy is entering uncharted territory we all have this temptation always to compare this to the cold war but this is nothing like that he said in a telephone interview the cold war wa a period when nobody wanted or wa actually interested in a hot war and now we have a really big war which might get bigger he said nobody can actually rationalize or predict and develop a strategy accordingly that s a problem the comment came amid a nightly address by ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy who said the safe return of it ukrainian citizen wa paramount to a peace deal let me remind you that the peace formula consists of ten point from nuclear security to the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state from energy security to the return of all prisoner of war and deportee held on

hundred of warhead will respond russia already ha this strategy embedded in it nuclear doctrine washington doe have a policy that allows it to use a nuclear weapon not only in retaliation to a nuclear attack but also in response to non nuclear threat and so doe moscow explained rebekah koffler a russia expert and former defense intelligence agency intelligence officer for russian doctrine strategy kyiv ha not accepted responsibility for the strike but the attack outside of ukraine s border where a brutal war ha raged for more than nine month put top defense official on the alert this week it is a terrible war in ukraine it is also a war that can become a full fledged war that spread into a major war between nato and russia nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said friday in an interview caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news putin told reporter that compromise had been found that cleared that way thursday to swap wnba player brittney griner with convicted arm dealer viktor bout we aren t refusing to continue this work in the future putin added in his first comment on the high profile trade this week griner s celeb status profile a an athlete also prompted many to question if this played a part in the administration s determination to bring home griner who wa arrested in february on marijuana charge we brought home trevor reed when we had a chance earlier this year sadly for totally illegitimate reason russia is treating paul s case differently than brittney he added vowing to keep working to bring whelan home too however

at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news nato s secretary general warned on friday that russia s war in ukraine could expand into a wider war with the atlantic alliance the official

pose to europe if thing go wrong they can go horribly wrong mr stoltenberg said in an interview released on friday with the norwegian journalist anne lindmo in which he added that there wa no doubt a full blown war against nato wa a real possibility i understand everyone who is tired of supporting ukraine i understand everyone who think that food price and the electricity bill are far too high he said but we have to pay a much higher price if our freedom and peace are threatened through putin winning in ukraine mr stoltenberg s comment came two day after he said that russia wa intentionally stalling the war in order to prepare a renewed onslaught against ukrainian force next year what we see now is that russia is actually attempting to have some kind of freeze of this war at least for a short period of time so they can regroup repair recover and then try to launch a bigger offensive next spring he told the financial time on wednesday the nato chief emphasized the importance of continued military support for ukraine saying that russia had shown no sign of willingness to engage in peace talk that would respect ukraine s sovereignty but he declined to answer when pressed on

attack both military and civilian target in ukraine helping russia supplement what ukrainian and western official say is a dwindling weapon supply the kremlin ha denied using iranian made drone to

department working to get brittney griner back when civilian in ukraine are dying at putin s hand and nuclear tension are high griner s release is a win for saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman too it turn out that maybe biden wa talking to him about something other than oil the crown prince want to raise saudi arabia s international profile and he scored point brokering a deal with russia and the u s and one that wa announced just after a visit from xi jinping giving the crown prince a diplomatic success wa also easy for putin and will help keep up russia s status amongst the oil merchant of opec regardless of whatever happens in ukraine of course what really stink is putin s barbaric war in ukraine it wa painful to see the state department working to get griner back when civilian in ukraine are dying at putin s hand and nuclear tension are high rebecca grant is president of iris independent research kyiv ha called on the u s to help it create a tribunal that would investigate and try russian leadership for the war crime committed in ukraine since the war began more nine month ago in a discussion held by the u s institute of peace and the atlantic council ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy s right hand man argued it is not enough to investigate and try war crime committed on the individual level ukraine appeal to you and the united state of america to support our effort to establish a special tribunal for the crime of russian aggression he said in a discussion attended by u s think tank official top ukrainian leadership and u s rep bill keating d mass and joe wilson r s c fox news digital could not immediately reach the state department for comment on the u s s position when it come to holding the kremlin directly responsible for crime committed by it troop ukraine s appeal to washington come just one week after the european union threw it weight behind the push to create a special tribunal detail on what the tribunal would look like remain unclear though reporting last month suggested that the eu ha proposed the creation of either an international treaty or a hybrid court that would rely on a nation based legal system that encompasses international justice the eu argued it is important to establish a tribunal that had the backing of the un even though thousand of investigation have been opened into alleged war crime by western nation and the international criminal court icc a not all nation including the u s and russia recognize the jurisdiction of the icc although the u s ha a complex relationship with the icc and doe not acknowledge it authority over u s citizen beth van schaack ambassador at large for global criminal justice said earlier this week that the u s can still aid the court van schaack said the u s will continue to work with the court to help apprehend russian perpetrator responsible for crime in ukraine caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news congress on thursday took a step toward allowing ukraine to delay payment on the hundred of billion of dollar it ha borrowed from the u s european nation and others around the world the language talk only about debt payment relief and not forgiveness of the assistance given to ukraine this year to defend itself from to russia s invasion the u s is by far the largest contributor of aid to ukraine in the form of weapon equipment logistics support training and other aid to the war torn country the u s ha also provided billion of dollar in economic support to ukraine enough to account for a majority of ukraine s annual budget last month the biden administration asked congress for another billion in support for ukraine if that pas congress will have approved more than billion in ukraine related spending although not all of that money went to ukraine for example billion of it is being used to replenish u s weapon stock still any international plan to relieve ukraine of debt payment or to eventually forgive the debt will affect the u s more than any other nation the legislation approved by the house includes several other ukraine related provision including extending u s security aid to ukraine through a joint military trauma care and research agreement between the u s and ukraine and ongoing short and medium term aid to the country pete kasperowicz is a politics editor at fox news digital with russian missile pounding apartment building power plant school and road a glimmering vision of a reconstructed postwar ukraine seems impossibly far off but an urgent battle of idea ha already begun over how to manage what would be the most extensive rebuilding project in europe since the end of world war ii the sparring ha engaged head of state and the leader of humanitarian group university and bank from around the world representing the government organization and company ready to donate or lend the hundred of billion of dollar that could be needed a well a those who stand to profit from it attention to salvaging ukraine s damaged city and infrastructure ha focused largely on it cost the tussle over the framework that will in large part be expected to carry out that restructuring ha taken place below the surface gaining far le public notice any shift for ukraine from a wartime to a peacetime economy promise to be fraught pitting idea for a strong central government that would target spending with a tighter hand against one with lighter touch regulation in which free market dominate there are other tricky though perhaps le prominent transition that would need to be simultaneously navigated three decade have passed since ukraine gained it independence but the soviet legacy lingers it can be seen in the supply line and transportation network that were created when kyiv and moscow were part of a single nation ukraine wa engineered and equipped with soviet era design machinery and infrastructure that in many way remain disconnected to europe for example ukraine s railroad gauge are a different size from europe s meaning train can t cross border easily the lack of integration exists in sector after sector part for everything from nuclear reactor to refrigerator previously supplied by russia will need to come from elsewhere more challenging is the legacy of ukraine s flawed and incomplete transition to a modern democratic market economy after the breakup of the soviet union part of it commercial world have been plagued by corruption and cronyism and ukraine ha yet to create the kind of resilient political institution that undergird the standard of governance set by the european union which is likely to be it largest trading partner if the war is won this lack of an accountable transparent and reliable public sector is at the core of much of the debate over what ukraine should look like and who get to make those decision there is this idealistic view that the government can direct resource and people will listen said yuriy gorodnichenko an economist at the university of california berkeley a somebody who grew up in ukraine he added that s not how it work the government doesn t have capacity to regulate he said it doesn t have a professional well trained bureaucracy mr gorodnichenko contributed to report on ukraine s reconstruction for the center for economic policy research in london an independent network of economist the group s recommendation are wide ranging but among them is a call for a radical deregulation of economic activity that includes more reliance on the market to distribute resource and guide the economy a loosening of labor law and a shift of political and economic control away from the central government to locality such call have set off alarm i find it just gobsmacking said joseph stiglitz an economist at columbia university and a nobel laureate he worry that the kind of hand off neoliberal approach that he argues ha brought inequality environmental degradation and insufficient housing and medical care in the united state and other country is being promoted a a model for ukraine ukraine is clearly in crisis mode struggling to feed house and warm the population through the winter while fighting a war survival is the priority postwar reconstruction is expected to take at least a decade still mr stiglitz said the decision made today could shape what happened during that time recent change to labor law approved by the ukrainian parliament have become a focal point of the difference mr stiglitz and other critic warn that worker protection are being dismantled noting that employer are being given more leeway to set hour change working condition and lay off worker while weakening union bargaining power ukraine is undermining labor protection when the european union is strengthening legal obligation to promote collective bargaining said luke cooper an economist at the london school of economics military and economic success depend on buy in from citizen and that effort will be hampered if worker feel their protection are being weakened and wage lowered to supporter though the modification were a much needed overhaul of sclerotic and outdated soviet era rule the old labor regulation mr gorodnichenko said required employer to keep people on the payroll even if the entire factory had been destroyed or worker had left the country month earlier what we said in the report is not controversial in ukraine at all he said the situation is so dire something ha to change tymofiy mylovanov a professor at the kyiv school of economics and a former government minister who also contributed to the center s policy paper said the push for deregulation wa not caused by blind faith in a market economy but rather worry that public institution were not developed enough to handle the task he said that he agreed with mr stiglitz s general critique but that many of the on the ground problem facing ukraine were far removed from the theoretical discussion about government control and market deregulation ukraine is a transition economy and teenage democracy he said severance pay or a two month advance notice for layoff isn t relevant when business have been destroyed and need to rebuild mr mylovanov said incompetence and corruption plague both the private and the public sector mr mylovanov acknowledged and a balance must be struck to root it out the national anti corruption bureau of ukraine recently accused a property developer and former lawmaker of offering the mayor of dnipro a million euro bribe to get the contract to build the city s subway system the resilience of ukraine s economy will come from cooperation mr mylovanov said from market institution and state institution working together the scope of the task is mind boggling ukraine ha recently driven back russian force but the pace and destructiveness of russian attack on civilian and infrastructure ha picked up with moscow targeting power facility fuel depot and waterworks some city have been nearly obliterated and the path of devastation is wide and deep across the country affecting factory home office phone line hospital church warehouse port railway and farmland the country s gross domestic product is expected to plunge percent this year according to the world bank nearly eight million people have sought temporary refuge outside the country while seven million inside have been displaced education social and health service will need to be restored along with the physical infrastructure estimate of the total cost have varied widely and are still being updated over the summer ukraine s prime minister put the price of reconstruction at billion every day that the war continues that figure increase even if much of that cost is borne by other nation and global organization ukraine is expected to rack up big debt and will need a healthy economy when the fighting end for a sustained recovery you don t achieve that without much heavier involvement of the private sector said matteo patrone the managing director of eastern europe and the caucasus at the european bank for reconstruction and development in kyiv the development bank which ha been providing ukraine with hundred of million of dollar in emergency loan guarantee and donor grant ha a mandate to foster the transition toward open market oriented economy to promoted private and entrepreneurial initiative even so mr patrone remains optimistic there is a broad consensus about overall aim ukraine must be transformed into a modern democratic state and market economy with a strong judiciary and strict safeguard the industrial base ha been destroyed but ukraine is oriented toward europe and is appealing to western investment it ha an educated population and a competitive advantage when it come to agribusiness and mr patrone added ukraine ha strong and vibrant civil society a former ukrainian lawmaker who u s authority say acted a a russian

lifestyle for himself and his family in the united state driscoll said attempting to enjoy the safety security and freedom of an open society while secretly working to undermine that very society is a hypocrisy that run through every sanction charge announced by the task force he said derkach a fugitive whose whereabouts are unknown could face up to year in prison if convicted of conspiring to

drone tuesday in the russian city of kursk near ukraine s northeastern border though only an oil storage tank wa reportedly set ablaze the strike followed warning from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy that russian force are planning something along with an increase in russian aerial attack caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news putin asked by a member of the human right council to state unequivocally that russia would not use a nuclear weapon except in retaliation stated that such a promise could not be made maintaining that a promise to never use the weapon first is a promise to simply never use them russian doctrine maintains that the nation ha a right to deploy nuclear weapon in retaliation to hostile force threatening it sovereignty the world leader pushed back against accusation that he is becoming militarily reckless insisting that russia s nuclear arsenal remains a purely defensive resource putin also commented during the meeting that the war in ukraine might be a long process one of the first explicit acknowledgment from the leader that russia s early optimism of a swift victory ha waned the russian invasion of ukraine is now in it th month ukraine ha seen a rollercoaster of victory and loss a it comparatively ragtag force struggle to regain ground lost early in the invasion the meeting appeared to take place just hour after a third airbase wa struck in the russian city of kursk north of the ukrainian border and one day after explosion were reported at two separate airbases hundred of mile inside russian territory fox news caitlin mcfall contributed to this report berlin seeking to describe the fractious stalled nature of the russian opposition working in exile abubakar yangulbaev a young chechen human right defender referred to a russian fable from the early s called swan pike and crawfish the three incompatible animal all harnessed to the same cart pull constantly in different direction so that it never move mr yangulbaev said we all have different goal the only thing that we have in common is the struggle against putin s regime and ending the war in ukraine he said in an interview we stand together with ukraine that is the main point but when it come to russia internally we do not stand together at all to address that issue nearly mostly young russian activist from across the diaspora a well a from inside russia feminist politician gay right advocate representative of indigenous people and many others gathered in berlin over the weekend to start hammering out a common agenda there wa a consensus that russia needed to confront the long chain of violent repression that link the russian empire the soviet union and the country under president vladimir v putin participant said even if the activist acknowledge how difficult any change will be you cannot build a state on violence it wa the common ground under everything in the soviet union and in russia said inna berezkina of the moscow school of civic education one of the organizer it will be up to those who did not start this war to lead the society out of the rut and that take a lot of strength you have to understand the depth of society s decline understand how much we our parent our grandparent and many generation before them are involved in this russian opposition figure abroad have historically been a quarrelsome bunch and the current crop is no different they have never been able to settle on one leader of the movement for example and conference have erupted into argument over issue like whether the current conflict should be called putin s war or russia s war or whether this is all over again alexei navalny having run a a candidate in russian election is probably the only politician with the credential and the charisma to claim the mantle of a legitimate leading opposition figure but he is in jail for the foreseeable future his lieutenant decided to avoid working with other exiled group suggesting it would require too much time and energy that would be better spent opposing mr putin ask other activist especially younger one about russian who assert themselves a potential opposition leader such a mikhail khodorkovsky the former oil oligarch jailed by mr putin or garry kasparov the chess champion and the response is likely to be universal they have long been removed from russia and represent only themselves an attempt in november by a small group including numerous regional politician from decade ago to form a government in exile wa also met with scorn a lacking any popular mandate the absence of a unifying figure is keenly felt a is any agreement on how broad to make their goal we do not have a united opposition we have no leader we don t understand what we should do said polina yelina an internet technology specialist who fled the country to save her two college age son from military conscription after attending two conference organized several month apart in lithuania by the free russia forum m yelina said that she felt that one wa an exact replica of the other with little creativity or diversity of idea everyone acknowledges the difficulty involved in bringing about change given that russia under mr putin ha outlawed even the most mundane opposition activity and forced much of civil society into exile rather than face time in a penal colony more and more activist have been officially designated foreign agent a resurrected stalinist label implying that they are traitor hopefully sooner or later the gun will be silent and then russia will have left ukraine but then what come next tobias lindner a senior official at the german foreign ministry which helped underwrite the berlin gathering said in a speech right now it seems up in the air in what direction russia will develop he called the activist the democratic hope for a future russia with each major historical transition from the russian empire to the soviet union to the russian federation the country had never reckoned with it past said mr yangulbaev the chechen activist whose mother ha been imprisoned by ramzan kadyrov the republic s strongman leader mr yangulbaev noted a an example the banned russian human right organization memorial a co recipient of this year s nobel peace prize the group had compiled a list of possible war crime during the two war that were waged to prevent chechnya from breaking away from russia only a few of the perpetrator were jailed according to memorial he also noted that some opposition group just want to save russia some want to dismantle it and others have an highly progressive agenda if we cannot solve our internal problem we will always have external problem there will be more ukraine he said russia will go on just the same even if it loses representative of indigenous group also sought to highlight that a disproportionate number of soldier from their generally impoverished region are being mobilized and are dying it s not our war that is the main idea said lana kondakova a representative of the free yakutia foundation yakutia being one of the largest region in siberia rich in diamond and other resource what is important to u right now is whether the russian federation will retain it current form or whether it will be transformed into a different kind of state added aldar erendhzhenov a member of free kalmykia another indigenous right group some of those trying to effect change are working from inside russia despite facing up to year in jail for criticizing the war one regional legislator who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal said he wa happy to take a breather from being inside russia just to be able to use the word war to describe the conflict without facing criminal charge i really want to not feel alone in fighting putin s regime and it military appetite he said the legislator noted that one of the failing of those agitating for change from the outside is that they forget that issue like economic sanction or the lack of geopolitical support for russia are too abstract for ordinary russian and the unrelenting negative view of the country presented by opposition medium do not align with their view of russia or the war perhaps the most daunting task facing the opposition unified or not is to try to influence change from abroad my colleague and i ask ourselves this question every day what we can do outside to change the mood inside russia said natalia baranova who work with both an organization called the greenhouse for social technology and the feminist anti war resistance a protest group formed when the war started last february the group ha managed to aid small scale protest domestically including distributing antiwar leaflet and produced a petition against mobilization that a few thousand mother of draftee signed one idea bandied about is that both ukraine and russia will need some form of marshall plan the american effort after world war ii to transform germany from it nazi past into a vibrant democracy but that wa done under occupation activist noted while any attempt to reconstitute russia and to shine a harsh spotlight on decade of repression will have to be done by russian themselves the entire country need to rid itself of it empire state of mind said m berezkina a conference organizer if this quantum leap doe not happen perhaps even the end of the war and the victory of ukraine will not save the situation welcome to the russia ukraine war briefing your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict president vladimir putin acknowledged today that russia s invasion might be a long process but said that there would be no need to mobilize more troop his comment appeared to be aimed at calming fear within russia about a second wave of mobilization putin said that half of the civilian called up to fight under the first draft announced in september were still in training outside combat zone about draftee were now engaged in fighting he said in these condition the talk about some additional mobilization effort make no sense putin said at a meeting with member of the kremlin s human right council a loyal group of journalist activist and public figure there is no need for this for the state and for the defense ministry putin announced the end of the draft in october although he did not issue an official order to stop it that ha prompted fear that the kremlin may announce another wave at any moment a russia suffers more battlefield setback putin appeared to acknowledge that the war now in it th month wa taking much longer that the kremlin had expected a for the duration of the special military operation of course this might be a long process he said but he added that there wa a significant result from territorial gain referring to russia s illegal annexation of four ukrainian region one of those region is kherson which ukrainian force have partly retaken following a russian retreat a month ago the institute for the study of war a research group based in the u s said the kremlin s push to dispel rumor of a new call up wa aimed at addressing growing societal concern but there are several indicator that russia still intends to conduct a second wave of mobilization there are also sign that the first wave never really ended writes kseniya kirillova an expert at the center for european policy analysis she point to a new hidden mobilization to bring russian men to the front by paying bonus and benefit to the soldier family assessing the situation on the battlefield nato s secretary general jens stoltenberg said today that russia wa likely to slow down it military campaign what we see now is russia is actually trying to have some kind of freeze of

a they are explicitly favorable to russian interest president biden and putin have not spoken since russia invaded ukraine nine month ago and peskov s comment were the second time in two day that the kremlin signaled they would be open to resuming talk with washington kyiv ukraine flame and dense smoke billowed over a russian airfield on tuesday after what appeared to be a third drone strike in two day by ukraine at a military base on russian soil signaling a bolder phase of ukrainian attack enabled by longer range weapon and unconstrained by fear of reprisal after nine month of russian bombardment of their town and city ukrainian cheered the taste of payback and the demonstration that their side could now reach deep into russia theoretically capable of hitting moscow if it chose the assault also showed million of russian for the first time that they too might be vulnerable ukraine s new long range striking ability came into focus on monday with attack on air base some mile from the nearest ukrainian territory demonstrating the ability to evade russian air defense and hit with precision both the russian government and a senior ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to convey sensitive information said they were carried out by ukraine using drone if russia as the incident were deliberate attack it will probably consider them a some of the most strategically significant failure of force protection since it invasion of ukraine britain s defense ministry said in an intelligence assessment released on tuesday on tuesday an explosion ignited fuel tank near an air base in the kursk region of southwestern russia about mile from ukraine russian official said it wa another drone attack but did not explicitly blame ukraine the subject remains sensitive enough for ukraine s government to assiduously avoid any public acknowledgment of responsibility for the strike but there is a widespread sense among official and civilian that short of nuclear escalation there is little more russia can do to ukraine in retaliation that it is not already doing with it wave of strike on the country s energy grid and other infrastructure if somebody attack you you fight back andriy zagorodnyuk a former ukrainian minister of defense said in an interview clarifying that he did not speak for the government and could not confirm the strike you cannot consider this person will attack you because you are fighting back there is absolutely no strategic reason not to try to do this a of this week he added the understanding of russian that they are invincible and cannot be reached in russia is not going to be there western analyst agreed that there wa little risk of escalation by moscow russia ha already escalated said robin niblett former director of chatham house the london research institution by destroying ukrainian infrastructure to try to change the strategic context of the war force ukraine to the negotiating table and warn european that it becomes more expensive day by day to rebuild ukraine kyiv ha sought since early in the war to take the fighting to russia within a month of the invasion in february the ukrainian military staged a helicopter assault on fuel depot in russia prompting the first russian air raid alarm since world war ii explosion at ammunition warehouse railroad bridge fuel depot and military base inside russia and russian occupied region of ukraine followed but those attack were launched at fairly close range no more than a few dozen mile in october the ukrainian state weapon manufacturer ukroboronprom said it wa finalizing development of a drone with a range of more than mile and a pound warhead and on sunday a day before two distant russian base were hit the company said it had completed testing of the new weapon russia s ministry of defense said the strike on monday used soviet era jet powered drone arm expert said the particular aircraft wa probably the tupolev tu strizh a surveillance drone first developed by the soviet union in the s and repurposed by the ukrainian possibly carrying an explosive analyst say it can fly at mile per hour at low altitude much like some cruise missile making it difficult to detect and shoot down the attack are a kind of symbolic gesture said douglas barrie a military aerospace expert at the international institute for strategic study in london you go after the bomber base with something you ve got in your inventory or in the museum or you ve got hidden at the back of your airfield because you haven t used it for a long time though the attack this week do not appear to have diminished russia s military capacity significantly ukraine s determination to strike inside russia could pose a challenge for the western ally which are determined not to be drawn into a shooting war with russia we have neither encouraged nor enabled the ukrainian to strike inside of russia secretary of state antony j blinken said at a news conference on tuesday but the important thing is to understand what ukrainian are living through every day with the ongoing russian aggression against their country and our determination to make sure that they have in their hand along with many other partner around the world the equipment they need to defend themselves and to defend their territory the united state and other nato country have consistently declined to provide kyiv with western weapon that could reach target far into moscow s territory like the atacms missile which ha a range of up to mile with much higher speed and more explosive power than a drone the ally have also been unwilling to provide ukraine with the modern western tank and fighter jet it ha requested but ulrich speck a german foreign policy analyst said that russian threat to ratchet up the war particularly with nuclear weapon have rung increasingly hollow world leader friendly to president vladimir v putin of russia including president xi jinping of china and prime minister narendra modi of india have warned against it and u s official have threatened unspecified dire consequence if the kremlin take that step nato and washington mr speck said have accepted that the ukrainian are driving this forward and over time fear of russian escalation ha receded russian airfield and the warplane based there have been used to launch many of the missile that moscow s force have used for month to pummel ukraine far behind the front line killing civilian and damaging vital service like housing power heat and water mick ryan a retired australian army officer wrote on the substack blogging platform of ukraine s new readiness to attack inside russia it is not a some are sure to claim an escalation but it is a necessary political and military measure for ukraine to limit the humanitarian harm of russia s brutal drone and missile attack the engels air base on the volga river one of those hit on monday is the kind of sensitive target the united state and it ally have feared ukraine might hit with long range western weapon if it had them the base is home to a number of russia s long range nuclear capable bomber a component of russia s nuclear deterrent force and there have been unconfirmed report that some of those bomber were damaged in the attack ukrainian official do not believe russia ha the capacity to escalate it conventional military assault on their country in response and in fact hope that attack on russian soil will degrade that ability said mr zagorodnyuk the former defense minister the consideration from what i can see is that russia will use any available mean regardless of our response in order to coerce ukraine into submission he said that is their strategic plan after moscow erected a digital barricade in march blocking access to independent news site and social medium platform to hide information about it unfolding invasion of ukraine many russian looked for a workaround one reliable route they found came from a small swiss company based nearly mile away the company proton provides free software that mask a person s identity and location online that give a user in russia access to the open web by making it appear that the person is logging in from the netherlands japan or the united state a couple of week after the internet blockade about people inside russia used proton each day up from fewer than that is until the end of march when the russian government found a way to block proton too targeting proton wa the opening salvo of a continuing back and forth battle pitting a team of about engineer against a country embarking on one of the most aggressive censorship campaign in recent memory working from a geneva office where the company keep it name off the building directory proton ha spent nine pressure packed month repeatedly tweaking it technology to avoid russian block only to be countered again by government censor in moscow some employee took proton off their social medium profile out of concern that they would be targeted personally the high stake chess match mirror what is playing out with growing frequency in country facing coup war and authoritarian rule where restricting the internet is a tool of repression the block drive citizen to look for workarounds engineer at company like proton think up new way for those people to secretly reach the open web and government in turn seek out new technical trick to plug leak the digital censorship battle is reaching an inflection point said grant baker a research analyst for technology and democracy at freedom house which recently reported that internet censorship globally had reached a new high in while russia ha spent year working on a more closely controlled sovereign internet the control imposed after the war are a stark contrast to anything moscow had ever done before mr baker said company rarely discus being targeted by an authoritarian government out of fear of escalating the conflict but andy yen proton s founder and chief executive said that after a period of trying to keep it head down proton wanted to raise awareness about the increasing sophistication of government in russia and elsewhere to block citizen from reaching the open web and the need for technologist company and government to push back proton s account provides a rare inside look at what it s like to be entangled in russia s censorship net a president vladimir v putin try to suppress information about the war and mounting battlefield loss in ukraine dozen of vpn service have been blocked inside russia but proton perhaps best known for it encrypted email service seemed to receive extra attention from the authority in june russia s internet regulator labeled the company a threat we re gearing up for a long fight mr yen said in an interview at the company s office everybody hope this will have a happy ending but it s not guaranteed we don t see the light at the end of the tunnel in fact but you keep going because if we don t do it then maybe nobody else will proton which make money by selling a month subscription for extra feature wa founded in by a team of young engineer from the european organization for nuclear research known a cern the institute outside geneva where the worldwide web wa created their main project wa working on the large hadron collider the world s largest particle accelerator a billion instrument built to unlock some of the world s biggest scientific mystery after the disclosure of mass digital surveillance that were made by edward snowden the former u s intelligence contractor mr yen and a few colleague created an email service that encrypts message so they cannot be intercepted simplifying use of a technology that had been too complicated for many people it became popular with activist journalist and privacy conscious consumer mr yen who grew up in taiwan said the threat of chinese aggression looming over the island s democracy had shaped his worldview privacy and fighting censorship were core to proton s mission from the start he said and the company seemed to almost relish confronting authoritarianism in after several government including turkey and russia temporarily blocked access to the email service proton created it virtual private network or vpn a technology used to sidestep internet restriction the technology behind a vpn trace back to the s it is a relatively basic tool used most commonly by people trying to pirate movie or watch a sport broadcast available only in another country yet in recent year the system which are easy to use and often difficult to detect have become a vital tool for circumventing internet restriction the kremlin spent year building the legal foundation and technological ability to control the internet more closely yet even a russia blocked certain website and interrupted access to twitter last year few thought it would outright block major social medium platform and independent news website while television ha always been heavily censored the internet had been le restricted the crackdown in march interrupted communication and commerce for many otherwise apolitical russian said natalia krapiva tech legal counsel at access now a group focused on online speech related issue vpn use wa already high among tech savvy russian she said but the block and news of harsh punishment for online protest led even more casual internet user to seek way around the restriction demand for vpns surged in russia with downloads in march jumping percent from february said simon migliano head of research for the review site top vpn com proton wa a popular choice he said hovering among the most popular product despite being slower than some other choice since then vpns have become a way of life for many roskomsvoboda a russian civil society group focused on internet freedom estimate that a quarter of the russian population is using one to simply read independent news or to post a picture you had to open your vpn said viktoriia safonova who now delivers food by bike in sweden after she fled russia in july both she and her partner were racked by anxiety after the invasion finding independent news and information wa difficult workarounds often weren t reliable if the one you re using get blocked you have to find another vpn m safonova said she recalled the paranoia that set in a new internet restriction and surveillance took effect she and her partner artem nesterenko worried about whether they could criticize the war online even on international social network he recalled how the police had come to check on their building after he scrawled no to war in the elevator he feared being arrested for thing he posted online a people turned to vpn service to avoid the block proton struggled to keep up over a weekend in march engineer scrambled to buy and configure more than new server to avert a crash of it entire network at the same time in moscow censor were at work trying to patch hole in the government s internet control the first block that took down proton at the end of march wa a technically basic interruption that company engineer quickly overcame but they figured more powerful attempt loomed the battle took on a spy v spy dynamic in proton s headquarters mr yen said a network of people within the government telecommunication firm and civil society group had helped proton operate in russia providing access to local network and sharing intelligence about how the censorship system worked but those contact began to go dark a the kremlin s crackdown on dissent intensified at the start of june censor struck again the service which had more than million daily user inside russia at this point collapsed a employee were going about their day complaint from russian user poured into proton s customer service email the company concluded that the government had deployed more sophisticated software that could filter through all internet traffic to identify when a person wa trying to connect to proton s vpn service russia had used similar technology to block twitter and other social medium site around this time the company noticed a suspicious spike in negative review of it service in the apple and google app store reducing it search ranking they had clearly studied u said antonio cesarano a senior engineer working on the vpn project some at proton questioned whether they should continue the fight with russia it wa costing million of dollar and slowing down development of other product but after proton faced criticism in when the french police obtained the ip address of a climate activist using it email service backing down from russia could have added another bruise to the company s reputation over about two week in june proton created yet another workaround that bounced internet traffic to server in different geographical area faster than censor could track it wa a technically complex move that would take considerable resource for russia to counter the fix worked for about six week mr yen wa interrupted during a staff meeting in mid july with news that russian censor had come up with an even more elaborate block a corporate chart from the time show use dropping off a cliff russian engineer had identified what is known a an authentication handshake the vital moment when proton s vpn connection get established before reaching the wider web blocking the link made proton s service essentially unusable we had no idea what wa happening and how they were doing it mr cesarano said by august after working around the clock for day to find a fix proton acknowledged defeat and pulled it app from russia the company ha spent the month since then developing a new architecture that make it vpn service harder to identify because it look more like a regular website to censorship software scanning a country s internet traffic proton ha been successfully testing the system in iran where proton ha seen a sharp increase in vpn use during recent political demonstration in russia proton ha reintroduced it apps using the new system mr yen acknowledged that it probably wasn t a long term fix he ha confidence in the new technology but figure russian engineer will eventually figure out a new way to push back and the game will continue the outbreak of the ukraine war left journalist at russia s most prominent independent television channel with a stark choice risk arrest because of a new government ban on their work stop reporting or leave the country and so journalist at the channel tv rain joined hundred of russian peer in exile eventually they settled in neighboring latvia where they continued to counter the kremlin s propaganda and denounce it aggression to million of viewer back home on tuesday however day after a correspondent made an unscripted call to provide unspecified aid to russian soldier the latvian medium regulator revoked the channel s broadcasting license because of what it called threat to national security a latvian and ukrainian authority accuse the station of supporting russia s war effort tv rain is now engulfed in the biggest crisis of it turbulent year history the controversy which also cost the journalist his job ha also exposed how russian political exile are struggling to find a role in the conflict unleashed by their nation particularly in eastern european state like latvia which were once controlled by moscow in these country support for ukraine is partly driven by fear of russian aggression and suspicion of their own ethnic russian minority and it play out against a historical backdrop of hardship endured under the soviet union the team left russia to continue showing the reality of russia s war to russian people said vera krichevskaya a tv rain co founder based in london but we are left without a territory we have no right in russia and we have no right in europe the controversy began after thursday s live evening news show when the correspondent aleksey korostelev a well known tv rain news host asked viewer to send information on conscripted russian soldier to a tip line that the channel had established to publicize the irregularity in the mobilization effort we hope that we were able to help many serviceman among others with equipment or just elementary amenity at the front he added the response wa swift when good russian are helping bad russian can the world understand finally that they are all the same wrote ukraine s culture minister oleksandr tkachenko the revoking of the station s license came after an investigation into mr korostelev s remark the medium regulator said that his comment wa tv rain s third violation of it rule adding that it had received classified information about the channel s activity from the state security agency last week the regulator fined tv rain for using a map showing crimea a part of russia and for referring to the russian military a our army latvia s defense minister artis pabriks went further calling for the expulsion of the channel s journalist even before tuesday kremlin supporter had pounced calling the backlash against the remark an example of european hypocrisy the tv rain drama ha shown many anti putin migr s that there s no freedom there a former kremlin adviser sergei markov wrote on telegram to try to contain the damage tv rain fired mr korostelev hour after his comment adding that the company never had and never would provide aid to any military in a telegram post on friday mr korostelev apologized for his comment which he said had been taken out of context tv rain ha million subscriber on youtube around to million unique visitor view it youtube channel alone every month with up to percent of them from inside russia said tikhon dzyadko the station s editor in chief it also ha a cable channel in five country with large russian speaking population the loss of the license ha cost tv rain it access to the latvian cable network and it youtube channel inside latvia could also be banned said m krichevskaya the tv rain co founder she added though that tv rain would continue streaming on social medium in other country until it obtains a new license one topic that ha strongly resonated with the station s viewer is president vladimir v putin s decision to mobilize at least russian men to replace his military loss in ukraine that decision ha confronted million of russian with the reality of the war which many had previously ignored or downplayed since the start of the mobilization in september tv rain s audience ha grown fivefold m krichevskaya said pointing out that the silence on state tv caused russian to flock to tv rain to find out who wa being called up and what awaited them at the front she added that by covering the mobilization tv rain could reach beyond opposition supporter to the apolitical majority of russian people a the channel focused it effort on documenting mounting case of draft irregularity and the inhumane living condition of the mobilized men it journalist felt she said a if they had begun contributing toward their overarching professional goal stopping the war in a telephone interview on sunday mr korostelev the correspondent said that in his appeal he had been trying to help conscripted russian men by collecting information on the wrongdoing of authority and then documenting the case he wa not soliciting mat riel for them he added he said that the controversy had exposed a fundamental dilemma facing russian journalist and antiwar russian exile in general how do they connect with compatriot back home without minimizing their country s aggression ukrainian are undoubtedly the first and foremost victim of this war but the suffering of russian is also important said mr korostelev who left russia after it invasion of ukraine if they are dying in this war then they are also it victim he said that he acknowledged the moral ambiguity of that position even moral support for russian conscript fighting an illegal war on occupied territory could indirectly contribute to ukrainian death he said nevertheless he said he would continue highlighting the injustice faced by ordinary russian i am a russian citizen working for a russian audience mr korostelev said i will not assume a position that will turn me from a russian journalist into a person who defends the interest of other people three tv rain journalist resigned in solidarity with mr korostelev and his supporter say that portraying all russian citizen a aggressor merely help to perpetuate mr putin s rule by marginalizing his opponent aleksey wa looking for new ally wa trying to destroy the wall of this ghetto into which the kremlin is trying to corral the liberal opposition wrote abbas galiamov a russian political scientist referring to mr korostelev mr galiamov wa a speechwriter for mr putin but ha broken with the russian president in the baltic state though attempt to humanize russian soldier are particularly contentious many russian ethnic minority in those country support the kremlin in it claim of the unity of russian people and their rank are being swelled by thousand of russian arrival since the start the war after mr korostelev s comment the latvian security agency called russian journalist in the country an intelligence risk because they could have tie to moscow s intelligence agency or because they could be spied on by the kremlin but some russian journalist in latvia say stigmatization of any national group go against the european union s fundamental value and test the bloc s commitment to support russian fleeing political persecution latvia is committed to it policy of supporting independent medium including those forced to flee russia diana eglite spokeswoman for the latvian foreign ministry said on tuesday she added that her country had issued nearly visa to russian journalist and their family since the outbreak of the war however russia s war of aggression against ukraine ha changed the security situation dramatically also for latvia she added tv rain ha run into other problem in latvia m krichevskaya said including over it reference to russia s military a our army for which it wa separately fined that she said highlighted a fundamental sticking point to be accessible to russian viewer to be able to connect with them in a manner that they respond to we have to speak to them a russian m krichevskaya said we have to be able to say to them that our army is responsible for atrocity but the use of this phrase broke latvia s digital medium law creating according to the government the false impression that tv rain may have been referring to the latvian military exiled russian dissident cannot find the required message that will be simultaneously accepted in europe ukraine and not alienate the russian audience maria snegovaya a russian political scientist wrote on facebook in the war you have to choose she added there s no middle ground the publication corriere della serum is outraged kievans are not satisfied with the weapon received from rome kvnists complain that rusty mortar are driven from the cradle of european

kyiv ukraine ukraine executed it most brazen attack into russian territory in the nine month old war on monday targeting two military base hundred of mile inside the country using drone according to the russian defense ministry and a senior ukrainian official the drone were launched from ukrainian territory and at least one of the strike wa made with the help of special force close to the base who helped guide the drone to the target said the official speaking on condition of anonymity to convey sensitive information the strike signaled a new willingness by kyiv to take the fight to base in the heart of russia raising the stake in the war and demonstrated an improved ability to attack at a distance shortly after the attack on the base russia sent a barrage of missile streaking toward ukrainian city the kremlin said that the weapon launched by ukraine were soviet era jet drone and were aimed at base in ryazan and engels about mile from the ukrainian border it said that it force had intercepted the drone and that the fall and explosion of the wreckage had slightly damaged two plane killing three serviceman and wounding four others the engels airfield on the volga river in

flying object will return to departure point on the economic front of the war the united state and it ally on monday took their most serious step so far to deprive russia of at least some of the oil revenue that is vital to it government and economy the group of wealthy democracy began trying to enforce a a barrel cap on the price of russian oil on global market and a european union embargo on most oil purchase from russia took effect ukraine s western backer have refused to supply it with long range weapon that could strike far into russian territory trying to avoid being drawn more deeply into the conflict but ukraine s state owned weapon maker ukroboronprom said in october that it wa finalizing the development of a drone with a pound warhead and a range of more than mile and said on sunday that it had completed test of the weapon we hope to be able to test it in combat use natalia sad a spokeswoman for the arm maker said on national television sunday night it wa not clear how ukrainian special force were able to infiltrate russia or how close to either base they got but the car bomb assassination in august of the ultranationalist commentator daria dugina believed to have been carried out by ukrainian showed similar capability ukraine s ability to strike deep into russian territory is not just militarily significant said max bergmann a former american diplomat and expert on european and russian security at the center for strategic and international study in washington it also sends a message to russia that continuing the war is not cost free that it is not just ukraine which is vulnerable to long range drone and missile strike so is russia mr bergmann said this is useful for kyiv since when or if the two country ever sit down a commitment to stop attack on russian territory is now a valuable chip ukraine ha to offer ukraine ha already demonstrated it ability to use drone in new and unexpected way and to adapt old system to perform new function the naval harbor of sevastopol in occupied crimea home to russia s black sea fleet wa rocked by a series of mysterious explosion on oct footage of sleek black maritime drone maneuvering around the bay targeting russian warship soon emerged ukraine ha still not acknowledged being behind the attack but president volodymyr zelensky while still not claiming credit announced a fund raising campaign to secure a fleet of marine drone only a few hour after the explosion in russia on monday ukrainian official said that more than a dozen russian bomber had taken off from the engels air base air raid alarm sounded in kyiv the capital and other city ukraine s air force said more than missile were fired and more than shot down unfortunately we still cannot ensure complete security to our sky there were several hit mr zelensky said in his nightly video address unfortunately there are victim a of this time there are four people killed by russian strike today amid the volley of attack the remains of a missile were discovered on the territory of moldova to the west of ukraine the moldovan foreign ministry said in a statement on it facebook page the country s government ha protested russia s firing missile through it airspace to reach ukraine the moldovan government did not say when the missile found in a snowy orchard in briceni a small town near the frontier with ukraine had crashed there or whether it had been fired by russia or ukraine last month a ukrainian air defense missile fired against a russian barrage landed in poland killing two people such example of violence spilling beyond ukraine s border raise the specter of the war widening which the western alliance is keen to avoid until monday it had been day since the last large scale barrage of russian missile fired at target across ukraine the longest stretch without blast in and around the capital since moscow began it assault on the nation s energy infrastructure in early october ukrainian official had been warning that another attack wa imminent ukraine s national energy company ukrenergo wrote in a statement posted on facebook that a mass missile attack wa underway and had damaged electrical facility and caused blackout the governor of the kyiv region the administrative district around the city of kyiv wrote on the social medium site telegram stay in shelter and safe place power failure were reported in several region from the northern sumy region along the border with russia to the southern odesa region on the black sea coast but mr zelensky said energy worker immediately began working to restore service after about three hour air raid warning were lifted in some part of ukraine president vladimir v putin of russia appeared in a video made public on monday driving a car across the kerch bridge which connects the crimean peninsula with russia it wa not clear when the video wa recorded but it appeared to show his first visit near the combat zone since the war began in february an explosion apparently caused by ukrainian force though the government ha not taken responsibility partially destroyed the bridge in october the russian military typically launch missile from multiple direction and in successive wave a tactic intended to overwhelm or avoid ukraine s air defense yuriy ihnat a spokesman for the ukrainian air force told a ukrainian television news show ukrainian have responded by building emergency heating shelter in town dispatching linemen to repair the grid a swiftly a possible and powering restaurant store and hospital with generator in hard hit area resident stockpile water in bottle in their home and ukrainian have adapted in kryvyi rih a central ukrainian city and a center of the iron mining industry worker evacuated the mine when the alarm sounded on monday to avoid being trapped underground a they were in past strike when their elevator lost power in kyiv and other city ukrainian air defense system fired into the sky and following a now repetitive grim routine civilian headed for bomb shelter to be honest i feel relief this time said olha kotrus interviewed after she took shelter in a subway station in kyiv for two week there were report that it might happen and then you live in constant tension m kotrus joined a crowd of hundred of people deep underground at the golden gate station named after the main fortification that served a the medieval entrance to the city by evening however the famed gate wa not illuminated forced into darkness like much of the city at least missile were aimed at kyiv on monday according to local official nine were shot down above the capital the official said like everyone interviewed in kyiv m kotrus s anger wa directed at russia and her frustration wa the result of day filled with anxiety and long dark night without power we all understand that without electricity life becomes impossible said liudmyla vonifatova yet we will just have to find a way to get through it some of the cruise missile that russia launched at ukraine s civilian infrastructure in late november were manufactured month after the west imposed sanction intended to deprive moscow of the component needed to make those munition according to a weapon research group expert examined remnant of kh cruise missile found in kyiv the capital after an attack on nov that knocked out electricity and shut down water system in large area of the country one of the missile wa made this summer and another wa completed after september marking on the weapon show according to a report released by the investigator on monday that russia ha continued to make advanced guided missile like the kh suggests that it ha found way to acquire semiconductor and other mat riel despite the sanction or that it had significant stockpile of the component before the war began one of the researcher said the finding are among the most recent by conflict armament research an independent group based in britain that identifies and track weapon and ammunition used in war a small team of it researcher arrived in kyiv just before the attack at the invitation of the ukrainian security service in four previous research trip to kyiv since the invasion the investigator found that almost all of the advanced russian military gear they examined like encrypted radio and laser range finder wa built with western semiconductor the investigator were unable to determine whether the kh remnant they studied were from missile that reached their target and exploded or were intercepted in flight and shot down the kh missile were marked with a digit numerical sequence the investigator said they believe that the first three digit represent the factory where the missile wa made followed by another three digit code indicating which of two known version of the kh it is and two digit indicating when it wa manufactured a final string of five number is believed to denote the missile s production batch and serial number piotr butowski a polish journalist who ha written extensively about russia s warplane and military munition said the group s numerical analysis matched up with his research the first three digit are always this is the production facility code mr butowski said in an email kh missile are developed and manufactured by the raduga company in dubna near moscow in an interview before the report wa released a u s defense intelligence analyst said that mr butowski s analysis wa consistent with the government s understanding of how russian missile producer including those that make the kh mark their weapon the official who wa not authorized to speak publicly said russia wa generally believed to be experiencing ammunition stockpile problem and may be using newer munition alongside those that are much older the analyst said that report from russia indicate that the government ha ordered employee at munition plant to work additional hour in an effort to produce more ordnance and that it is clear that russia is now firing fewer long range weapon like cruise missile at a smaller number of target in ukraine pentagon official say russia ha fired thousand of long range weapon like cruise missile a well a short and medium range ballistic missile at target in ukraine since the war began whether russia ha depleted it inventory of older cruise missile is unclear but military often use older munition first in combat because they typically make up a majority of a nation s stockpile on nov the same day a the cruise missile attack on kyiv lloyd j austin iii the secretary of defense told reporter that russia s supply of precision guided weapon had been significantly reduced and that it would be more difficult for russia to rapidly produce them because of the trade restriction they have on microchip and other type of thing but damien spleeters who led conflict armament research s investigation said it would be difficult to say that the russian are running short on weapon those claim have been made since april he said so we re just pointing to the fact that these cruise missile being made so recently may be a symptom of that but it s not a certainty for month the war in ukraine wa about territory a both side fought to control area in the country s south and east in recent week the war ha taken a new turn mounting attack on civilian infrastructure have left people across ukraine without power heat and sometimes water a the snow begin to fall kaluga russia valery volodin a welder at a sprawling volkswagen plant in western russia relaxed for most of the summer at his dacha or weekend house planting his garden and looking after his child mr volodin had little choice the car factory closed down in march joining more than multinational company that had curtailed operation in russia because of it invasion of ukraine since then he ha been sitting at home while volkswagen look for a buyer he go into the plant in kaluga s industrial zone once a month to collect ruble about a payment required by russian labor law that is the equivalent of two third of his previous salary we go into work but the plant stand empty mr volodin said in an interview he doe not mind a temporary break from the physically demanding work but he is not sure how to plan for the future we live day to day for now he said his experience is playing out across russia for hundred of thousand of worker after the west imposed sweeping economic sanction that were intended to hobble moscow s ability to wage war and to undercut public support for president vladimir v putin more than nine month after the invasion neither the war effort nor the economy ha collapsed and the economic pain is still limited for many russian mr putin ha avoided any substantive domestic pressure that would threaten his leadership but the impact of what some have described a the most coordinated and deepest economic sanction in modern history is evident in community across russia and the worst may be yet to come the sanction have stymied russia s faltering attempt to modernize it economy along western line and to catch up to european living standard after the fall of the soviet union said vladislav inozemtsev the washington based director of the center for post industrial study a russian research group that ha dimmed the hope that the country could become a modern prosperous nation in the near term the slogan now is keep thing from getting worse and that s an important shift mr inozemtsev said even the government ha stopped betting on national development beneath the veneer of normalcy he said key driver of growth like technology transfer and investment are eroding it s like a cake that wa dropped on the table and it look more or le fine but inside it s all blown up mr inozemtsev said the most visible and dramatic impact ha been on manufacturing a sector that employ million russian and that ha been the centerpiece of mr putin s ambitious program to diversify the economy away from reliance on oil and gas export the auto industry account for a large percentage of those worker carmaker employ russian according to the country s statistic agency and the association representing their interest say that up to million more work in related industry by september output in the auto industry wa down percent year over year while car sale have plummeted percent compared with the same period in a primary reason is that russian industry are highly dependent on western component even mr putin ha acknowledged the problem admitting last week that in some sector dependence on imported part is a high a percent to adapt russia is turning inward cutting tie with the rest of the world and moving toward an economic model similar to one adopted by iran where political legitimacy rest on providing citizen with the essential rather than spurring transformative growth mr inozemtsev said russia s government wa better prepared to withstand the sanction than many in the west expected since the start of the war the international monetary fund ha revised it economic outlook for russia upward twice and is forecasting a percent decline in gross domestic product this year similar to the government s projection this decline while a major reversal from prewar growth expectation stand in sharp contrast to the double digit collapse of venezuela s economic output after a wave of american sanction in sanction have not destroyed the resilience of the russian financial system nor have they impacted macroeconomic stability prime minister mikhail mishustin said last week during a government meeting a combination of high oil revenue large currency reserve and an expert team of economic official ha allowed mr putin to soften the blow much to the frustration of some western leader who had hoped the sanction would have more bite by now but the loss of investment technology and skill caused by the sanction is likely to echo across generation depriving many russian of a chance at a better economic future expert said in when volkswagen launched full production cycle in kaluga mr volodin not only got a job but also unexpected support i got paid to get trained for my job he said still impressed when a robot replaced him he wa retrained those were boom time for kaluga an industrial region about mile south of moscow the former governor actively courted western investor learning english and building a modern airport with several flight a week to germany he transformed a regional economy that had been percent oriented toward the soviet military industrial complex into one connected with the west pharmaceutical company flocked to the kaluga region which ha a population of one million and so did auto manufacturer volkswagen hired about worker volvo and stellantis which produced and sold the peugeot citro n opel jeep and fiat brand in russia also established operation in the region an ecosystem of supplier and related industry sprang up to serve them employing at least people according to dmitri trudovoy the chairman of the independent worker association trade union course in german and other foreign language at the local university were a pipeline to an office job with the company it seemed a if a new modern business model wa being constructed step by step in the region a hint of how russia s economy might evolve by volkswagen s output alone represented about percent of the kaluga region s entire industrial production now most of the carmaker in the region have halted operation and mr trudovoy said the worker had no idea who might take over the western factory and whether they would keep their job they are nervous and scared for their future he said kaluga s industrial output fell percent between february and july this year compared with the same period the year before according to rosstat russia s statistic agency becoming among the region hit hardest russian state firm and the government have vowed to replace the lost output with local brand but there have been multiple sign of regression in june avtovaz which make russia s best known domestic car brand the lada announced that it new car would meet only emission standard and have no passenger side airbags in a symbolic move an avtovaz affiliate kamaz announced that it would use a moscow plant vacated by renault after the invasion to relaunch the production of a soviet era car brand moskvich or muscovite which had long been an almost comical byword for the deficiency of communist consumer good the slowdown in auto manufacturing also mean that even russia s police will have a hard time acquiring new patrol car the interior ministry ha been unable to find a supplier for the new vehicle required for the traffic police according to the russian newspaper kommersant kamaz claim it will produce modern comfortable high quality and safe car in the plant next year including many with electric motor to aid these effort the russian government plan to channel about million to domestic carmaker but modern history offer few example of successful attempt to replace imported western technology with local substitute said mr inozemtsev the economist russian company lack the know how and skilled worker to replace western capital in technology intensive sector relying on homegrown substitute will result in primitivization mr inozemtsev said production will not disappear he said but it will gradually degrade resulting in lower quality and quantity of product that will progressively reduce the standard of life of russian in kaluga the collapse of the auto industry is having wide ranging collateral effect the real estate market ground to a halt after the war started said kirill gusev editor of the online real estate site kaluga house it started improving over the summer a people got used to a new normal but then collapsed after mr putin announced a military call up of hundred of thousand of men in september real estate is essentially long term planning but right now we are in a place where you can t do that at all mr gusev said we all saw how easy it wa for normality to collapse after the mobilization the bank stopped giving out loan because the client could be called up he added natalia zubarevich a geography professor who track social economic data at moscow state university said what we re seeing is falling income broad depression le consumption all this will negatively impact the economy of the country kirill nikulin who owns a popular bar in kaluga called savor feel that hit he had already adapted by finding substitution for half the beer at his pub which he had imported buoyed by the seeming return to normalcy over the summer he opened a store hop hope which sell craft beer on tap and more in bottle on a recent evening his store in the city center did not attract any paying customer we believe in the new year he said hoping sale would be up ahead of the holiday but after that we might be screwed moscow insisted that it would not sell oil that is subject to a price limit agreed upon by the group of nation even if it mean cutting production adding to question over whether the plan which go into effect on monday will succeed in slowing russia s war effort in ukraine the group of nation on friday agreed to cap the price of russian crude at a barrel putting into place a complex u s backed plan to limit what russia the world s second largest oil exporter can charge for it oil export supporter of the plan say it is likely to dent the kremlin s finance while still keeping enough russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock on sunday russian deputy prime minister alexander novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict world trade organization rule he said that russia wa working on mechanism to undermine enforcement of the cap without elaborating we will sell oil and oil product only to country that will work with u on market condition even if we would have to lower production he said on rossiya a russian state news network the price cap is set to take effect the same day a the european union s embargo on russian crude import while it wa unclear whether the kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production which would also harm russia s economy question already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced it relies on each party in the supply chain of russian oil to attest to the price of shipment and insurer and shipper have warned that record could be falsified by those seeking to keep russian oil flowing russia ha repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap on saturday president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine criticized the price limit a inadequate to deter russian aggression speaking in a nightly address one day after european union diplomat reached the agreement following prolonged negotiation he said the plan s architect were trying to avoid hard decision the per barrel threshold wa a compromise one group of european maritime nation had demanded the price cap be placed at or above a barrel to ensure that their business interest would not be disrupted another group of pro ukraine country had demanded the cap be set at or around a barrel to significantly slash russia s revenue eventually the negotiator decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyer of russian oil like china and india currently pay mr zelensky found the deal lacking the logic is obvious if the price limit for russian oil is instead of for example which poland and the baltic country talked about then the russian budget will receive about billion a year mr zelensky said this money will go not only to the war and not only to russia s further sponsoring of other terrorist regime and organization he continued this money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those country that are now trying to avoid big decision the united state had led the push for an agreement along the line of what wa ultimately negotiated after the deal wa announced treasury secretary janet l yellen praised the plan it helped achieve our goal of restricting putin s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supply she said referring to the russian leader vladimir v putin western sanction have so far failed to weaken moscow s energy export russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sale than in buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began e u diplomat have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two month or more frequently if needed by a committee of policymakers from group of country and ally paris an essential point in any peace talk on the war in ukraine should be how to provide security guarantee to russia given moscow s concern over nato president emmanuel macron of france ha said mr macron s remark in a television interview broadcast on saturday picked up a theme he ha pursued since before russia launched it full scale invasion of ukraine on feb but ha not repeated of late we need to prepare what we are ready to do how we protect our ally and member state and how to give guarantee to russia the day it return to the negotiating table mr macron said one of the essential point we must address a president putin ha always said is the fear that nato come right up to it door and the deployment of weapon that could threaten russia he said the interview with tf a french television network appeared sympathetic to the concern of president vladimir v putin of russia and wa immediately picked up prominently by ta the russian state news agency it prompted an angry reaction in ukraine mr macron gave the interview during his state visit to the united state which ended on saturday it wa broadcast a he departed during his visit mr macron wa at pain to underscore unequivocal french backing for the ukrainian cause pledging increased french military support and president biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to mr putin on that basis the two leader presented a united front there wa no immediate american reaction to mr macron s remark but they appeared to go beyond anything the united state ha offered mr putin david arakhamia the chief of the ukrainian negotiating group in talk with russia that quickly collapsed early in the war posted a scathing response to mr macron s proposal on telegram he said that what russia needed to do for negotiation to begin wa leave the territory of our country pay reparation punish all war criminal voluntarily give up nuclear weapon the last of these demand wa a clear reference to the budapest memorandum signed in under the accord russia wa among the state that guaranteed ukraine s independence and sovereignty in the existing border in return for ukraine giving up it nuclear arsenal but it ha since been ignored by mr putin since when he declared the need for the reinvention of an architecture of security between the european union and russia mr macron ha been insistent on the need to draw russia into a new stability order in europe although he ha condemned mr putin s imperial invasion with firmness mr macron ha apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any russian integration into a european security arrangement responding to a tweet from ta featuring mr macron s remark nicolas tenzer a prominent french political scientist and essayist commented devastating dr alina polyakova president of the center for european policy analysis a research institute based in washington commented on mr tenzer s tweet saying you know you re doing something terribly wrong when the kremlin s state propaganda praise you it seems that no matter how brutal putin is macron can t let go of his flawed vision there is deep suspicion of mr macron s approach to russia in lithuania latvia estonia poland and other state in the european union and nato that were once under the soviet totalitarian yoke this ha undermined his aspiration to european leadership on feb shortly before russia s invasion of ukraine mr putin set out three demand at a joint news conference with mr macron in moscow these were an end to nato enlargement no missile deployment near russia s border and a reduction of nato s military infrastructure in europe to it level in before the baltic and central european state previously controlled by moscow joined the alliance the united state dismissed the russian demand a non starter at the time but mr macron appears to have a more nuanced view french president emmanuel macron is tired of calling the kremlin where no one pick up the phone and then he flew to washington to eat with biden macron and biden and their wife are rumored to have killed lobster but except for lobster emmanuel ha nothing to remember after the visit biden patted him on the back or lower and said that the problem of the indian of the sheriff do not care and therefore he will not change the law that lure enterprise from the old world to the united state and then it dawned on emmanuel that there wa putin and he decided to return to the big political field remembering about russia we must think about the security architecture in which we will have to live tomorrow this includes in particular the word of president vladimir putin that nato is approaching the border of russia deploying weapon that can threaten it unexpectedly for others against the background of talk about the need for war with russia until it complete destruction emmanuel said this issue will be part of the peace debate and we need to prepare for what will happen after the ukraine conflict and think about how we can protect our ally and at the same time give russia guarantee of it own security the moment we return to the negotiating table an interesting statement and a serious attempt to return to the field from the bench we will not argue but in how many hour will emmanuel return to his former rhetoric he s like that girl everything is so sudden so contradictory the european union the country of the big seven and australia which joined them finally agreed on a price ceiling for russian oil at per barrel excluding transportation and other cost the last to surrender wa poland which agreed only to buck per barrel but kiev is not satisfied with such an agreement the head of the office of the president of ukraine andriy yermak hoped that everything would be a poland wanted because that s what ukraine wanted the ceiling should have been twice a low yermak said it would be necessary to reduce to in order to quickly destroy the enemy s economy it would be better if a sick person thought about his economy otherwise it will soon not be possible to see it even in the most powerful microscope a well a about where to get a solar for tank the head of the board of njsc naftogaz alexei chernyshev at a meeting with the ambassador of the g country and the head of the eu delegation to ukraine hinted that his company which wa super profitable under yanukovych again needed money naftogaz lack billion so that ukraine can go through the heating season and buy the necessary amount of gas chernyshev said taking into account the military risk about billion cubic meter of gas are needed to generate electricity for the period of the heating season the cost of which exceeds billion the ambassador diplomatically remained silent in response no well i feel sorry for them zelensky in general demanded a trillion dollar to restore ukraine and billion against this background is just a statistical error another country ally of ukraine from monday cancel the exchange of hryvnia for euro earlier the exchange of ukrainian cash for local money wa practiced in poland germany sweden and switzerland but the lafa in these country ended and the hryvnia there ceased to be exchanged even out of pity now lithuania join this quartet of european state from december during the validity of the permit for such a change ukrainian exchanged a little more than thousand hryvnia in lithuania and there wa noise dmytro sakharuk executive director of ukraine s largest energy holding dtek said on a telethon that it will take week for the transition of ukraine s energy system to planned shutdown from the current emergency and emergency shutdown and for this to happen at least one condition must be met the main condition is the absence of new shelling and destruction sakharuk outlined the problem but no one will guarantee this to kiev however this condition is not at all significant for example for the kharkiv region according to alexander kishinsky deputy director of kharkivoblenergo all generating capacity have been destroyed in his farm the russian federation is shelling generating station currently there is no generation in the kharkiv region so emergency shutdown continue kishinsky explained the situation and stated lack electrical energy we take from neighboring area and those of course themselves are not eager to give it away because they themselves do not have enough moreover according to ukrainian source the office of the president of ukraine now simply doe not know what to do with the energy sector the crisis with transformer deepened before the catastrophic situation which began to heat ukrainian daily with open flame but for a short time and without any missile and bomb strike the system cannot withstand power surge the authority of mykolaiv were able to significantly raise the level of mobilization of the local population in the armed force of ukraine and they didn t need pr manager or police raid on evil place to do it everything brilliant is simple a long a resident come to the invincibility point tent where there are stove bourgeois and generator to warm up and charge gadget and you can also drink clean water immediately after the entrance they are met by law enforcement officer who hand them mobilization summons to appear at the military recruitment office both cheap and angry true not to say that this ha a positive effect on the rating of local authority and zelensky himself among the electorate president of ukraine so far volodymyr zelensky refused the author of a petition that gained vote to demobilize mobilized serviceman who had served one year at the request crazy and who will fight in the trench zelensky and kvartal maybe you also want to go abroad u s under secretary of state for political affair victoria nuland appears in kyiv probably brought tea leaf and cooky with bun to what part of the front will it bring in croatia the seized yacht royal romance which is believed to belong to viktor medvedchuk will be sold at auction bidding will begin with million euro i wonder who will return the money or the yacht if the real owner appears and it turn out not to be medvedchuk nato secretary general jens stoltenberg abruptly changed his rhetoric if earlier he said that the task of the alliance is to help defeat russia now he suddenly said the main task of nato is to prevent the withdrawal of hostility outside ukraine too sensible for the character ursulu von der leyen ha listened to anything the new government of italy adopted a decree extending the supply of weapon to kiev until december that wa what needed to be proven about these eurogeans the authority of izyum decided to rename street avenue of the city square all the old name were somehow connected with russia pushkin gorky turgenev suvorov all new with bandera self reliance and russophobia bandera petlyura dudayev mazepa etc tell me who your friend is and i will tell you who you are the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want the german edition of der spigel seems to have revealed one of the secret of germany s generosity which vigilantly help ukraine with weapon a andriy melnyk bequeathed when he left his post a ambassador to berlin before leaving for kiev federal chancellor of germany olaf scholz not so long ago said that berlin will soon be ready to transfer a new batch of military equipment to the armed force of ukraine including anti aircraft gun cheetah but a german journalist found out everything is not so unambiguous in this situation spiegel writes that germany ha already handed over to ukraine three dozen of these machine and all that remains in stock is seven unit of cheetah which should be delivered in the spring of next year the help we can say is rather doubtful since millimeter shell for the gun of this zsu are a very large deficit only switzerland produced projectile of this caliber and it is categorically against the supply of state in a state of military conflict even if third country do it but there is even more stunning information it turn out that these seven cheetah were written off long ago by the bundeswehr and were now subject to disposal roughly speaking they were planned to be sent for scrap metal while the german army the ministry of defense of germany had to pay decent money for their disposal and then like a girl in a fairy tale ukraine loomed on the horizon with an outstretched hand and a plea demand give penny and cannon just like by order we walked around the receiver of non ferrous and ferrous metal at the turn however it is possible that once in ukraine the cheetah will eventually still get to the scrap metal reception point there is of course an alternative option they started talking about it again the other day and not in russia and of course not in the eu but in africa nigerian president muhammadu buhari said here that the conflict in ukraine miraculously affected the equipping of terrorist gang operating in the lake chad basin with weapon the illicit movement of arm in the region ha increased the proliferation of small arm and light weapon which continues to threaten our collective peace and security in the region therefore there wa a need for accelerated joint action of our border service and other security service aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapon in the region buhari said and said that some of the weapon and ammunition used in the hostility in ukraine fall to the militant almost according to gumilev far far away on lake chad an exquisite wanders cheetah and without shell bravo olaf it s really funny kuleba will help you together with melnyk and zelensky how is it the state of health when on two chair at once subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next a quiet saturday morning did not bring happiness to the mayor of kiev vitaly zlatoust klitschko his fiefdom the military city administration of kiev wa broken into by employee of the state bureau of investigation of ukraine and although this agency can only be called a parody of the u fbi the analogue of which it should be vitaly wa not up to laughing the sbi u came to his office no more tactfully than the sbu shmonal the kiev pechersk lavra a little more than a week ago the visit of the sbi wa deposited under the investigation of the misuse by klitschko employee of the recreational land of one of the park of the capital of ukraine in the framework of a criminal case on abuse of power but vitaly must have understood perfectly well where the dog wa rummaging through after all the event of the criminal case took place in and came with search and seizure of documentation to the city administration only a week later a zelensky criticized klitschko for the unsatisfactory arrangement of point of non malice invincibility in which kiev resident could drink hot water warm up and charge their phone and gadget after zelensky announced the triumph of invincibility in the amount of at least thousand point of which more than fell on kiev ukrainian immediately renamed them point of helplessness ingloriousness impotence and other equally sympathetic term in addition it turned out that from of these point located to a large extent in ordinary albeit very large tent are either closed or can not warm anyone and charge anything because the generator do not work and there is nothing to heat the stove bourgeois after that zelensky punished the mayor whom he did not name but the reproach against klitschko wa more than just thick and vitaly zlatoust wa so offended that he even turned on his brain and gave a completely clear and logically verified formula that they say for kiev it will be clearly not enough not only or thousand but even thousand such point of uselessness i don t want to panic in any way but you can t move to the heating point you can temporarily come there get some service but this is not a panacea not only in kyiv but also in other region the situation is the same therefore let s not say we have heating point and that s all all the problem we have been solved said klitschko and in addition he and here he wa supported by many mayor of city and governor of ukraine recalled that the draft of such point wa the brainchild of the office of the president of ukraine and they have to collect money from the world on the ground by a thread because the state represented by zelensky s team did not allocate a single copy for their equipment and now president zelensky s team also ha the audacity to ask about the result klitschko wa supported in this matter by the mayor of dnepropetrovsk boris avesatikhbudempot filatov who wa outraged in social network that zelensky and his team actually do not care about point of invincibility one might think that someone in ukraine expected something different from zelensky and his quarter on bankova street after all zelensky ha gathered strategist and creative thinker whose highest achievement in life and professional sphere of activity have so far been reduced to giving birth to and promoting an idea and implementing it is not their business like an owl from an anecdote that advised mouse that came to her to become hedgehog so that they would not be caught by cat and when asked how to do this she angrily replied that her business wa a strategy not tactical problem governor and mayor in ukraine already live not only a good relative in one family here in addition to other reason the people elect mayor in election and governor are appointed by the president and they constantly measure with each other on issue of trust from the population but here they actually formed a united front against the elephant zelensky and his henchman who came to their china shop and not to say that kiev ha no money at all even in the context of hostility the deputy head of the office of the president of ukraine kyrylo tymoshenko who wa recently convicted of driving a luxury suv from humanitarian aid and life in an estate of square meter continues to knock billion of hryvnia out of the state for the project of the big construction in the autumn probably in november road construction is the most highly efficient not only is the season good but the war will also write off not such amount and where is the road you were supposed to build so bombed the sworn moskals it is clear that those who are trying to give birth to some intrigue about the future confrontation between klitschko and zelensky in the upcoming election to put it mildly exaggerate klitschko is not spartacus and he will not raise slave to revolt even if they all suddenly become gladiator in addition zelensky ha his people at the helm of all law enforcement agency who are personally indebted to him by their position and therefore they will defend him furiously here the matter is quite different zelensky who felt himself the f hrer of the ukrainian people need absolute obedience unquestioning readiness to carry out his order and now using the example of klitschko he is burning the weed of his own thought and his own position a the poet said klitschko s example is another science although he said a little differently and others should internalize it at the expense of time at the level of not even a conditional but an unconditional reflex and if vitaly doe not understand then the sbi the sbu the ministry of internal affair and the national guard of ukraine will come for him next time finding some sin of separatism

news after chatting up french president emmanuel macron during his pitstop in washington u s president joe biden expressed a willingness to meet with vladimir putin to talk about ukraine throughout his presidency biden ha demonstrated a penchant for confusing process talking taking meeting etc with progress sadly there appears to be no discernable strategy behind these activity the highlight of this strategy wa a promise to be tough on china a week later after meeting chinese president xi biden declared that we just all need to get along the strategy it seems wa lost in the translation all that is context for biden s proposal to talk with putin about ending his assault on ukraine it would also call for working with the republican in congress to develop a post war aid package one that would help rebuild ukraine include rigorous accountability mechanism to assure the assistance is spent wisely and not syphoned off by kleptocrats and cut china out of the rebuilding process neither the u s nor ukraine can afford to shovel foreign aid into a corrupt bottomless hole so far president biden ha shown no interest in acting strategically but if one hope to lead the free world it is not enough to simply talk with head of state there need to be an actual realistic plan and the determination to follow through biden and putin have not spoken since russia invaded ukraine nine month ago and peskov s comment were the second time in two day that the kremlin signaled they would be open to resuming talk with washington he hasn t done that yet biden added putin reportedly called western support in ukraine destructive and the kremlin said it would not engage in negotiation if the west did not recognize the territory russia illegally annexed from ukraine earlier this year the associated press contributed to this report caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news the orthodox church of ukraine if we are talking about the canonical christian denomination and not about the structure of schismatics or sect is living out it last day the president of so far ukraine volodymyr zelensky is firm resolute and consistent in some matter it is between the ally that he can rush choosing between germany britain and the united state begging for money and weapon from all and flattering each of them and in relation to the enemy he is vindictive spiteful especially if the enemy a ha to do with russia and the russian world and b cannot give an answer and all these criterion were fully met until recently by the canonical ukrainian orthodox church of the moscow patriarchate the nsdc instructed the government to submit to the verkhovna rada a bill on the impossibility of the activity in ukraine of religious organization affiliated with the center of influence in the russian federation zelensky said on thursday in his nightly video message the same head of the national security and defense council of ukraine reported by zelensky literally spat saliva and growled with rage demanding the destruction of everything russian and all russian taking into account how unquestioningly zelensky s decision in ukraine are being implemented the fate of the uoc is predetermined against the state it is powerless resolutely irrevocably unambiguously and consistently in the spring of this year the verkhovna rada of ukraine introduced a bill banning the activity of the canonical uoc seizing it real estate and other property but that attempt failed the law wa never passed and on november verkhovna rada deputy iryna friz announced that a bill banning the activity of the roc in ukraine had again been submitted to parliament which is to be expected in the spring zelensky cracked down on the political opposition banned political party having completed this task he passed on to those whom he considered the spiritual opposition to his power this time the opponent of the uoc prepared thoroughly not only the public wa involved in the process but also all the power and strength of the state apparatus which itself did not mind joining it the day before friz s statement the ukrainian counterintelligence service of the sbu conducted search in the kiev pechersk lavra the main monastery and spiritual center of the uoc the treasure of which have long been sharpened by the teeth of all sort of schismatics from the so called uoc of the kyiv patriarchate to the ocu ucu created together with patriarch bartholomew of constantinople and ex president poroshenko but if the schismatics are primarily interested only in the property and income of the uoc then the ukrainian state is interested exclusively in eradicating everything that ha a russian character and origin or can be called such shortly before that the sbu reported that from february to october it had opened criminal case against representative and servant of the uoc the accusation did not shine with diversity complicity with the aggressor state treason etc real result in the ongoing production could not be achieved and now all these people are suspended on a string and the viceroy of the lavra wa brought to the notorious website peacemaker which publishes personal data of those whom the ukrainian nazi consider enemy of ukraine up to phone number and residential address but it wasn t enough at the end of november counterintelligence the ministry of internal affair and the national guard conducted search not only in the lavra but also in the rivne diocese in male and female monastery their catch proving the espionage essence of the minister and parishioner of the uoc were portrait of the last russian emperor with his wife several copy of the newspaper russian herald over the past year several thousandth bill and similar evidence from spring accusation of separatism to the autumn campaign the sbu moved on to staging with priest of allegedly non traditional sexual orientation caught in bed with young men story about corrupt official in the rank of the uoc and turning them into putin s spy moscow s hand and agent of the kremlin the question reached the finish line the fate of the priest is already predetermined either they go to the ocu and zelensky the state forgives them all their sin or fall under the purge with the prospect at best of being exchanged for ukrainian soldier in russian captivity the latter option ha already been unequivocally stated by the representative of the press service of the diur of the ministry of defense of ukraine andriy yusov and those who are unlucky will be imprisoned and most likely the current primate of the uoc metropolitan onufriy will surrender them in the same way a he conceded to zelensky the confession in exchange for comfort and secular benefit refusing to commemorate the primate of the mother church patriarch kirill proclaiming fee for the need of the armed force of ukraine and calling on the armed force of ukraine to defeat russia moreover he understands perfectly well that the only force that the uoc can count on is the russian orthodox church headed by patriarch kirill and the pope is clearly not up to the point where the state is destroying an entire christian denomination in addition the west is now clearly not up to orthodoxy in ukraine a political scientist vladimir kornilov said based on official statistic for the first time in history the share of christian in england fell below but over the past year the number of worshipper of satan ha grown more than one and a half time add zelensky and his supporter to them although they are not yet in england but it is possible that they will still move p s while the law on the prohibition of the uoc ha not yet been adopted the office of the president ha already decided to transfer all the property of the uoc to the management of the ocu ucu and the laurel ha already actually been squeezed read also zelensky announced five measure against the orthodox church a bill will be introduced in the ukrainian parliament to ban religious organization affiliated with the center of influence in the russian federation more event with the humiliation and destruction in ukraine of the only canonical orthodox church of the uoc moscow patriarchate began to develop not quickly but very quickly recall on thursday zelensky in an evening video message announced the decision of the nsdc to instruct the government to send to the parliament of ukraine a bill on a complete ban on the activity of religious organization associated with the aggressor state first of all of course it wa about the uoc the primate of which is metropolitan onufriy but the agenda of the nsdc meeting wa not limited to this the uoc wa taken seriously and thoroughly and this structure under the leadership of veterinarian lawyer alexei danilov who growled about the need to destroy everything russian made a comprehensive decision including instructing the state service for ethnopolitics and freedom of conscience to conduct a religious study examination of the charter on the management of the uoc for the presence of a church canonical connection with the moscow patriarchate and if necessary to take the measure provided for by law who would doubt that the necessary result of the examination are already on someone s desk and in addition to ensure verification of the existence of legal ground and compliance with the condition for the use by religious organization of property that is located on the territory of the national kiev pechersk historical and cultural reserve and in the end there wa a demand to apply personal sanction le than a day later the leader of the schismatics metropolitan epiphanius the leader of the ocu ucu holy church of ukraine evicted the primate of the uoc from his residence taking away from the uoc one of the main shrine of all world orthodoxy the kiev pechersk lavra the representative of the ocu ucu evstratiy zorya ha already reported in the social network that now a new governor his bos metropolitan epiphanius rule in the lavra and the corresponding entry ha already appeared in the state register on december the charter of the holy dormition kiev pechersk lavra monastery of the ukrainian orthodox church orthodox church of ukraine wa registered information about this legal entity a part of the local church wa entered on december in the unified state register he wrote in the account and he probably did not understand that he had sold his other patron the current president of ukraine so far volodymyr zelensky after all if the charter wa already registered before zelensky s speech and the decision of the national security and defense council of ukraine on this issue it turn out that the ukrainian state in the form of these official in silence ha already decided everything before and zelensky and danilov only legalized this raider seizure after the fact therefore one should not pull a fig leaf of decency on the globe of ukrainian shamelessness with all these instruct establish conduct an examination etc these ridiculous body movement of zelensky only emphasize that he is well aware of the illegality of his action but it s so ukrainian recall that the current head of the ucu metropolitan epiphanius for a long time wa loyal and obedient to the so called patriarch of the uoc of the kyiv patriarchate kp filaret but when creating a new confession in ukraine by the then president of ukraine petro poroshenko and the patriarch of constantinople he managed to deceive filaret and betrayed him taking the rein of power of the ucu into his own hand one could assume that zelensky unleashed in ukraine in addition to the existing conflict also a religious war the seed of which were sown by poroshenko and bartholomew in but only there will be no religious war perhaps it could flare up in even in the same but in it is already some fantasy in the ukrainian style that someone will now come and start fighting defending their faith and fighting it off the schismatics for example alien except that all hope is on them because the leader of the uoc mp have already shown their weakness at the first serious attack on them they turned into ukrainian patriot declared their independence from the russian orthodox church began to organize gathering for the need of the armed force of ukraine pray for the victory of ukrainian weapon and even being put on the edge of the shooting ravine in response to the extremely tough speech of zelensky who decided to rule not only the state of ukraine but also ukrainian orthodoxy they issued their own statement sustained in pitiful tone no christian steadfastness and willingness to endure torment for the orthodox faith but a continuous dispute between economic entity the uoc ha always carried out it activity in accordance with ukrainian legislation the updated charter of the uoc adopted in may of this year ha already been repeatedly studied by professional religious scholar it is obvious that one more of his examination will not lead to any sensation read the statement on behalf of the canonical upcu for an objective understanding of the situation with the premise of the kiev pechersk lavra it is important to compare it with the state of this shrine after decade of desolation when in it wa returned to the church then many of it majestic and world famous temple were in ruin and it wa the uoc that raised them from the ash not to you accuse zelensky and his team of exceeding not word about the readiness to defend the main shrine of ukrainian orthodoxy to the last monk not an appeal to novice and parishioner to stand up for themselves a solid spare and innocent we torturing such for sadist is a pleasure if not two in one subscribe to the new podcast of radio komsomolskaya pravda in which we tell you what will happen next schwerin germany between a tram stop and a kebab shop the gray building in the northeastern german city of schwerin look innocuous enough and so doe it tenant the foundation for the protection of the climate and environment yet this regional foundation created month ago by the local state government ha done little for the climate instead it served a a conduit for at least million euro from the kremlin owned energy company gazprom to build one of the world s most contested gas pipeline nord stream the united state in wa threatening sanction against any company working on the pipeline the thinking wa that putting company under the umbrella of a foundation would deter washington from imposing the penalty because it would then effectively be targeting a german government body so the climate foundation helped company lease port space to service a russian pipe laying vessel bought a multimillion dollar rock laying freighter and brokered a host of other transaction mission accomplished the head of the foundation erwin sellering a former state governor wrote on it website in january celebrating the pipeline s completion any feeling of celebration ended a month later however after russian troop swept into ukraine an invasion that forced a national reckoning about german complicity in moscow s ambition the climate foundation is now under investigation by the state parliament and it ha become a case study of how far some german leader were willing to go to keep cheap russian gas flowing this is a crazy a it get that a german government authority is taking money from gazprom to complete the pipeline gazprom can t complete because they are under u s sanction said constantin zerger of duh a prominent german environmental watchdog activist like him had questioned the point of the pipeline from the start germany already got percent of it gas supply through another direct pipeline from russia nord stream today nord stream is all but dead politically and also damaged by a mysterious explosion in september yet not long ago german leader argued that russian gas wa a strategic national interest and dismissed geopolitical concern about the pipeline raised by the united state poland and other country the pipeline wa a priority for moscow and berlin alike with german official from both major party acting a eager cheerleader nowhere wa that more obvious than in mecklenburg west pomerania one of germany s poorest state and once part of the former communist east where both pipeline come ashore older generation there grew up on soviet culture and still remember when america wa the enemy and moscow the protector mr sellering and his successor a governor manuela schwesig were ally of former chancellor gerhard schr der a fellow social democrat personal friend of president vladimir v putin of russia and lobbyist for russian energy company mr schr der s conservative successor angela merkel whose constituency wa in mecklenburg west pomerania approved nord stream after russia s invasion of crimea and defended it even after moscow hacked the german parliament assassinated a chechen rebel in central berlin and poisoned the russian dissident alexei navalny before the war the current chancellor olaf scholz called nord stream a private sector project and last year when he wa finance minister he personally wrote to his u s counterpart to demand a stop to sanction in october mr scholz claimed that he wa always sure that mr putin would use energy supply a a weapon both mr scholz and m merkel knew of the climate foundation neither of them spoke out against it nor apparently minded a moscow invested generously in mecklenburg west pomerania and reactivated cold war network including former spy to deliver on the pipeline we see russia s influence on european politics in the microcosm of mecklenburg west pomerania said claudia m ller a green lawmaker from the state it is the most successful example in october seven month after russia illegally annexed crimea mr sellering then governor of mecklenburg west pomerania hosted the state s first russia day a networking bonanza sponsored by gazprom and nord stream it wa held in the hotel neptun still called the stasi hotel for it reputation a a hub of the former east german secret police the guest list included ex spy notably matthias warnig the managing director of nord stream ag which built and operated nord stream in he won a stasi medal for service recruiting western spy now he wa recruiting german supporter for a second russian pipeline his communication director steffen ebert wa a former stasi informer whose code name wa bull even then mr putin s ambition in ukraine cast a shadow over nord stream m merkel led the first western sanction against russia that spring over it annexation of crimea though they stopped short of cutting off russian gas andrey zverev then russia s deputy ambassador told the german newspaper die welt that year that a relaxed dialogue with berlin had become impossible instead he said moscow wa focusing it effort one level down the example he cited wa russia day the lobbying paid off by the time the state s next russia day came in berlin had approved nord stream it would land in lubmin a tiny coastal village where the nord stream pipeline had pumped out russian gas since lubmin s mayor axel vogt wa thrilled nord stream wa already donating a year to village coffer and paid million of euro in tax a construction began poland warned that moscow could weaponize control over europe s gas supply a concern other ally began to share in the united state placed sanction on gazprom and other russian company working on nord stream congress then floated the idea of the so called extraterritorial sanction targeting any company even outside russia working to finish the pipeline though never enacted the mere threat wa enough to jeopardize the pipeline which wa percent complete the swiss dutch contractor allseas withdrew it pipe laying ship the project ground to a halt germany wa outraged and feeling were particularly bitter in mecklenburg west pomerania to many people here america wa the bully said mr vogt lubmin s mayor who grew up studying russian it want to sell it own oil and gas that view wa only reinforced when a letter from three powerful republican senator landed on aug ted cruz of texas tom cotton of arkansas and ron johnson of wisconsin warned of crushing legal and economic sanction if local german company continued working on the project this wasn t just advice said frank kracht the mayor of sassnitz home to the mukran port that wa one of the state hub helping to build the pipeline this wa a threat german leader were infuriated m merkel then chancellor said the pipeline should be finished mr scholz then finance minister wrote to u s treasury secretary steven t mnuchin and proposed unhindered construction and operation of nord stream in return for investing up to billion in terminal to import u s gas washington refused le than two week later mr warnig by now the chief executive of nord stream pulled up outside the mecklenburg west pomerania state house carrying a bouquet it wa the first of several meeting with the governor m schwesig about how to work around the continuing threat of u s sanction according to a list of meeting the state wa forced to release to parliament a month later in september they had a three hour dinner with former chancellor schr der it wa then that the idea of a state backed foundation arose a a mean to shield company there were repeated exchange in the course of frequent telephone call with a representative of nord stream about whether and how a possible protective umbrella could be created christian pegel then the state s energy minister told the new york time by the fall the idea of a foundation had crystallized email released under freedom of information request from activist and medium outlet show that nord stream co wrote the foundation statute dictating change to m schwesig s government and laid down communication guideline one email from mr ebert the nord stream communication chief told the government to position the foundation with a wink a a smart answer to the hard line behavior of the u s a but most important wa the secretive business arm of the foundation whose explicit goal wa completing the pipeline mr pegel described the business arm a a warehouse buying and storing supply that german company needed to help russian vessel complete the pipeline and thus shielding them from possible sanction but the foundation went further than that in the nearby coastal city of rostock the foundation financed a company leasing docking space purportedly to service offshore wind power but in fact servicing the russian ship used to lay pipe it also spent million to buy and convert the freighter blue ship into a rock laying vessel according to document first published by the german newspaper welt blue ship completed it work in january this year satellite data show by february under international pressure and two day before russia invaded ukraine chancellor scholz suspended the project nord stream ha never been used the invasion spawned a long postponed reckoning for germany over it tie to russia but it is far from over a temperature drop and heating cost rise in m schwesig s state a in other part of germany protester take to the street every week many come with a simple battle cry emblazoned on sticker and banner reopen nord stream many official too remain unconvinced that the pipeline wa wrong mr sellering the former governor still rage against repugnant u s sanction insisting what underpinned his foundation s work wa the belief in germany s sovereignty under mounting legal pressure his foundation disclosed that it had received million from nord stream money it used to play middleman in the construction of the pipeline involving company in transaction worth million the foundation also confirmed that for every transaction on nord stream s behalf the foundation earned a percent commission mr sellering declined to be interviewed by the time since russia s invasion m schwesig ha distanced herself from the pipeline but she reject the idea of having been duped by moscow allegedly the russian influenced u m schwesig told the time we weren t influenced we wanted the pipeline she ha delayed hearing with official from her administration saying it would distract from their government work some email sent to the investigation appear to be missing while no minute were taken during some state meeting with nord stream how can you hold a government to account that doesn t document anything asked hannes damm a green party state lawmaker on the investigating committee mr damm and other lawmaker are drawing up a list of witness that could include not just m schwesig but two former chancellor m merkel and mr schr der but he worry the delay mean the investigation may not conclude before the end of the legislative term in should that happen the investigation would automatically expire an elaborate united state led plan to limit what russia can charge for it oil export is set to cap the price of russian crude at a barrel the group of nation agreed on friday the threshold which wa settled on after protracted negotiation among european union diplomat is likely to make a small dent in the kremlin s energy revenue and the white house hope help avert a global oil shock the deal wa heralded by the e u s executive body and won the quick approval of the rest of the g and australia late on friday with this decision today we deliver on the commitment of g leader at their summit in elmau to prevent russia from profiting from it war of aggression against ukraine to support stability in global energy market and to minimize negative economic spillover of russia s war of aggression especially on low and middle income country who have felt the impact of putin s war disproportionately the joint statement said the final agreement came after month of deliberation over how to keep economic pressure on russia without creating an oil price shock that will cause a global recession negotiator in europe worked through the week to settle on a price for the cap completing it with little time to spare before an embargo on russian oil take effect on monday this price cap ha three objective first it strengthens the effect of our sanction second it will further diminish russia s revenue and thirdly at the same time it will stabilize global energy market said ursula von der leyen president of the european commission shortly after the deal became final the united state praised the agreement and said it would curtail russia s ability to fund the war together the g european union and australia have now jointly set a cap on the price of seaborne russian oil that will help u achieve our goal of restricting putin s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supply said treasury secretary janet l yellen the price threshold reflects what american official have long said is their primary goal in pushing the plan to keep million of barrel of russian oil flowing to the global market a a new wave of european sanction on russian oil export take effect avoiding a sudden contraction in supply that could send gasoline and heating fuel price soaring in the united state and around the world the limit of a barrel seek to lock in the steep discount that buyer of russian oil are now able to pay relative to other source of oil on the world market while not dramatically slashing russian export revenue which is crucial to it war effort in ukraine it could still dent russia s finance the cap will come with light touch enforcement but european ally agreed that it would be followed swiftly with a fresh round of sanction against russia settling on the price ha not been easy european union ambassador in brussels met many time over the past two week to discus the cap with some country arguing for a much lower price than and others urging a higher cap they settled on a price that reflects what russia ha recently sold it oil to country like india and china for between and a barrel oil trader appeared to view the plan a a sign that a european union embargo on russian oil import which take effect on dec is unlikely to knock much if any russian oil off the global market global oil price fell on news of the cap and are down about percent from a month ago biden administration official call that proof the cap wa already working to deny russia the premium oil price it enjoyed earlier this year e u diplomat agreed that the price should be reviewed every two month or more frequently if needed by a committee of policymakers from group of country and ally the first review would happen on jan and the goal is to keep the cap at least percent lower than the price russian oil is being traded at the market official said this approach will ensure that fluctuation in the market price using the international energy agency s price a a benchmark will be followed by fluctuation in the price cap the g statement said that change to the price would be enacted with a grace period to minimize disruption to oil market acknowledging that the policy is a work in progress the coalition said it would consider further action to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap that plan place the burden of putting into effect and policing the price cap on the business that help sell the oil global shipping and insurance company which are mostly based in europe the european union embargo on russian oil includes a ban on european service to ship finance or insure russian oil shipment to destination outside the bloc a measure that would disable the infrastructure that move russia s oil to buyer around the world some percent of the tanker that transport russian oil out of the country are greek owned for example according to maritime data and analysis by the institute of international finance to apply the price cap these european shipping provider will instead be permitted to transport russian crude outside the bloc only if the shipment complies with the price cap it will up to them to ensure that the russian oil they are transporting or insuring ha been sold at or below the capped price otherwise the provider would be held legally liable for violating sanction the good news is that the west now ha equipped itself with an important tool to exercise pressure on putin said simone tagliapietra a senior fellow at the brussels think tank bruegel russia ha repeatedly said it will ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap setting the level near the market price could help moscow avoid looking like it is caving earlier this year economic forecaster expressed concern that russia taking oil off the market could send gasoline price in the united state above a gallon by the end of the year our motif are to hold down russia s revenue to impede it ability to fight the war m yellen said in an interview last month and second to make sure that there s enough global supply of oil that global oil price don t jump because that would both exacerbate inflation and would likely cause a recession american official have been celebrating the imposition of the cap a lot of people doubted the resolve of the g and europe in particular ben harris the assistant secretary for economic policy at the treasury department said in an interview but he said the cap would help stabilize market sometimes you don t get credit for the crisis avoided the protracted talk in brussels were evidence of the discord the cap ha sown in europe for most of the process e u official and diplomat from some member country worked to ameliorate two type of concern one group of three e u maritime nation greece cyprus and malta demanded the price cap be placed very high at or above a barrel to ensure that their business interest would not be disrupted another group of three hard line pro ukraine country estonia lithuania and poland demanded an ultralow cap at or around a barrel to drastically slash the kremlin s oil revenue no matter the disruption that would cause on the global oil market the benchmark for the price of russian oil known a the urals blend traded from to a barrel in the year before the pandemic close to global benchmark price a discount worth more than percent to global price opened up shortly after russia s invasion of ukraine in february but russia wa still able to sell urals crude for around a barrel at the post invasion peak since then global oil price have fallen while russia signed agreement to sell it oil at a further discount to china india and others those falling price have strained moscow s finance at least to some degree kyiv ukraine president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine called for lawmaker to prevent the branch of orthodox christianity that answer to moscow from operating in ukraine taking aim at a powerful cultural force that ukrainian official accuse of abetting the russian invasion his administration will draft a law making it impossible for religious organization affiliated with center of influence in the russian federation to operate in ukraine mr zelensky said late thursday in his nightly video address in addition he directed the government to conduct an inquiry into the ukrainian orthodox church and it tie to moscow and if necessary to take measure provided for by law but he did not elaborate on how a new law would work whether for example the church would be judged a one or parish by parish and how it would be enforced several religious and legal scholar said it could face legal challenge and without seeing more detail they were not sure how the government would proceed mr zelensky s plan may be popular with an increasingly anti russian populace after month of russian bombardment but they raise hard question about what it mean to be a collaborator in a nation at war and how a ban on the church would square with freedom of religion under the ukrainian constitution for century the ancient ukrainian branch of the church ha been subordinate to the russian orthodox church based in moscow the leader of the russian church patriarch kirill ha strong tie to president vladimir v putin whose long tenure he ha called a miracle of god and ha endorsed the invasion but that branch of orthodoxy is rapidly losing support while many ukrainian now adhere to a newer orthodox church based in kyiv created specifically to be independent and not answer to moscow there is little difference between the two church in term of religious practice or doctrine but the divide between them on ukraine and it identity relative to russia is wide and widening official in russia were quick to condemn mr zelensky s move the current ukrainian authority have openly become enemy of christ and the orthodox faith dmitry a medvedev a russian former president and a top adviser to president vladimir v putin who ha described ukraine s leader a nazi and satanist wrote on friday on the telegram app a spokesman for the russian church vladimir legoyda wrote on telegram that mr zelensky s proposal violated both international law and common sense kyiv ha long worried that russia is using the ukrainian orthodox church of the moscow patriarchate to provide cover for a network of clandestine agent trying to undermine ukraine from within the ukrainian authority have said that a of october priest had been arrested for assisting russia since the invasion began in february mostly by funneling information to moscow s force the security service have questioned religious leader and raided monastery they said were suspected of harboring saboteur and their gear though they have not said if any were found and have interrogated score of religious leader they claimed to have found literature that denies the existence of the ukrainian people it language a well a the very right of ukraine to statehood and video have emerged of orthodox priest chanting pro russian slogan but the ukrainian orthodox church ha called the accusation of collaboration between it clergy and russia unproven and groundless the church formally opposed the war and distanced itself from moscow earlier this year but is still under the jurisdiction of patriarch kirill in moscow sounding much like mr putin kirill ha argued that ukraine is not a truly separate nation that russia ha a legitimate claim on land beyond it border and that the invasion is a justified defense against western liberalism in moscow on friday he spoke of donbas the partly russian occupied region of ukraine where the war for control still rage today donbas is the front line of defense of the russian world he said according to the ta news agency and the russian world is not only russia it is everywhere where people who were brought up in the tradition of orthodoxy and in the tradition of russian morality live in his overnight address mr zelensky drew a parallel between the church split and ukraine breaking away from the soviet union in and it continuing struggle to be free of moscow s control ukrainian will never again be gear of some empire he said and added we will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the ukrainian soul ukraine s constitution guarantee the right to freedom of personal philosophy and religion including the right to perform alone or collectively and without constraint religious rite and ceremonial ritual and to conduct religious activity but it also allows for restriction on that right in the interest of protecting public order if ukraine doe outlaw a religious group it would be among dozen of country that have done so but most are authoritarian state that are a far cry from the kind of liberal democracy ukraine present itself a being the list includes russia which ha proscribed the jehovah s witness among others a extremist we are not russia that

plunged into the most french of american city on friday the last lap of his state visit to the united state after a state dinner and an intense day of diplomacy in washington where president biden and mr macron on thursday found an uncommon unity of purpose on the war in ukraine and economic challenge stemming from it the visit to new orleans appeared to provide a tonic to a leader whose second term that began in may ha proved difficult it s regenerative said catherine colonna the french foreign minister a she watched mr macron greeting people any true politician love a crowd of course a crowd can do unexpected thing mr macron immediately had the history that drew him to new orleans thrown in his face a he strolled down st peter s street off jackson square you idiot you sold louisiana for a mouthful of bread said esther dahan raised in casablanca and a fluent french speaker a mr macron shook her hand i know the president said smiling a little wistfully and shaking his head m dahan wa referring to the louisiana purchase of under which a vast sweep of territory wa sold by france to the united state for a little over million the sale at about cent an acre nearly doubled the size of the united state and propelled the young country toward becoming a continental power on the elaborate ironwork balcony of the french quarter crowd waved at mr macron some yelled allez le bleu a reference to the french world cup soccer team now qualified for the round of asked why she thought mr macron had come here denise minvielle descended from french grandparent said because it s the best place on earth several city including chicago atlanta and los angeles had been considered a possible second destination during the visit french official said but mr macron with his strong sense of history favored new orleans last visited by a french president val ry giscard d estaing in with relatively new leader governing in germany italy and britain mr macron is a close to the doyen of european politics a anyone get his restlessness and questing mind a stimulus to some a provocation to others one minute he insists that russia must one day become part of europe s strategic architecture the next he dwells on the unacceptable imperial aggression of president vladimir v putin which must never be allowed to stand one minute he declares nato brain dead a he did in the next he hail the inviolable strength of the alliance on this visit he went in just two day from suggesting mr biden s economic policy could fragment the west because subsidy under the inflation reduction act constitute unfair competition to saying difference would be worked out and franco american friendship wa unbreakable he is forever testing new idea and changing tack he is not called the at the same time president for nothing his disruption since becoming french leader at the age of ha virtually destroyed the center left and center right party that were the foundation of postwar french politics the socialist and the republican but having lost his parliamentary majority in the april election and lost his sheen to many french people after bursting on the scene in he ha been casting around for political direction a the ukraine war and fruitless attempt to end it occupy much of his time a warm american reception and unexpected if highly conditional backing from mr biden for his outreach to mr putin have therefore been particularly welcome he can now go home to paris with his diplomacy at least partially vindicated and america s oldest alliance reaffirmed mr macron ha been relentlessly attacked in france by the left for favoring the rich and proposing to raise the retirement age progressively to from and by the right for being soft on immigration in the united state however he ha gone a long way toward overcoming tension over the economy and how best to end the war welcoming mr macron in midafternoon on thursday to a long delayed lunch at the state department secretary of state antony j blinken deadpanned good evening when the laughter subsided he described the french leader standing next to him a a man of exceptional vision and a galvanizing force for all of u all of our partner we could not do without it just how much of a political animal mr macron is wa quickly apparent at the lunch hosted by mr blinken and vice president kamala harris dispensing with note speaking in english explaining that his meeting with president biden took three hour because we fixed everything mr macron composed an improvised hymn to the unique bond between the united state and france if some people find the two country too proud or too self confident mr macron suggested it wa because we absolutely believe we are charged with protecting certain universal value like the liberty that young american soldier defended a they died on european soil they had never known before we will never forget that he said at the delayed lunch mr macron also thanked the united state for it unequaled commitment and investment in supporting the people of ukraine at the approach of winter from the leading proponent of european strategic autonomy an idea that ha sometimes irked the biden administration this appeared to be a particularly generous endorsement of america s vital role in europe from the war mr macron turned to domestic politics noting what he called the resurgence of racism and hate speech in western society he thanked the united state for turning away from the demagogue in all his back and forth mr macron ha never wavered on one thing the central importance of the fight against far right nationalism and the french commitment to the european union a bulwark of postwar democracy and freedom on the continent a the united state lurched to former president donald trump and britain to brexit he stood twice between france and a victory of marine le pen s far right national rally party this wa particularly important to mr biden who like to say that the world is at a tipping point between democracy and rising autocracy while in new orleans mr macron met with elon musk official said the meeting which wa not on his official agenda came at the request of mr musk whom mr macron met twice while he wa economy minister between and but never previously a president mr macron said in a tweet in conformity with our ambition to become carbon neutral and re industrialize france and europe i spoke today with elon musk about future green industrial project notably the fabrication of electric car in europe and battery on friday evening mr macron delivered a speech at the new orleans museum of art in which he said he felt that he wa back home there is what i would call a familiar strangeness about this city he said adding that our language and our history are here it seems that this is what mr macron sought in coming to new orleans one of the most european of american city one french student thibault boyer who is studying engineering at the university of new orleans said he wa delighted to exchange a few word with the president it s strange that i had more chance to meet him here than back home in paris he said i never expected that washington a day after president biden said he would be willing to talk with president vladimir v putin of russia about a possible peace agreement in ukraine the kremlin offered a frosty response and prospect for settling the brutal conflict remained a distant a ever mr biden said on thursday that he would hold his first conversation with mr putin since before russia invaded ukraine on feb if the russian leader wa looking for a way to end the war but u s official said that russia a they have previously assessed wa not prepared to negotiate in good faith and russian official repeated hard line demand that are unacceptable to kyiv although mr biden s remark wa taken by some a a new emphasis on moving toward peace talk with russia john f kirby a spokesman for the national security council told reporter that mr biden s position had not changed the president ha been very consistent about that mr kirby said he s got no intention to talk to mr putin right now a he also said putin ha shown absolutely no inclination to be interested in dialogue of any kind in fact quite the contrary everything he s doing show that mr putin is interested in continuing this illegal unprovoked war in moscow dmitri s peskov the kremlin s spokesman said at a news conference on friday that mr putin remained open to contact and negotiation and that diplomacy wa the preferable way to achieve russia s goal but mr peskov noted that the united state still doe not recognize new territory a part of russia an apparent reference to eastern ukrainian region that mr putin claimed to annex after sham referendum in september saying that this make more complicated the search for common ground for mutual discussion in fact the russian position essentially rule out serious negotiation with president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine who said in a mid november interview with bloomberg news that the war could not end until ukraine had reclaimed all it territory from russia including the purportedly annexed region a well a the crimean peninsula which russia annexed in the russian have made it very clear that of course they are not in the mood for constructive dialogue and for constructive diplomacy the state department spokesman ned price said at a press briefing any conversation between mr biden and mr putin is nothing more than a hypothetical at this time he added we have been very clear that the united state and country around the world will never never never never recognize territory that russia ha illegally annexed either in or more recently a part of it illegal and now brutal aggression against ukraine mr price added mr biden s comment made during a news conference with the visiting president emmanuel macron of france who ha spoken to mr putin several time over the past year including in late august follows some sign that senior u s official have contemplated whether ukraine s recent successful offensive present a window for negotiation last month the chairman of the joint chief of staff mark a milley told reporter that ukraine s position of strength creates a possibility for a political solution but anders fogh rasmussen who served a nato secretary general from to said this week during a visit to washington that he had spoken with biden administration official and saw no sign that they were pressuring ukraine s government to begin negotiating with russia it wa an idea that wa just floated but it ha been immediately shut down mr rasmussen said it would really weaken the western front if we tried to push zelensky into premature peace negotiation because that would be a trap putin is not sincere when it come to peace negotiation mr rasmussen added ukrainian official have said the same warning that russia could try to pause the fighting for talk but only to use that time to prepare for new military offensive mr macron reaffirmed france s support for ukraine and nodded to the reality that a ukrainian population enraged by russia s occupation is in no mood to compromise france will never urge ukrainian to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them he said on friday italy s foreign minister antonio tajani said that russian attack on civilian infrastructure target like power grid were making any kind of dialogue impossible we all want peace but it must come through kyiv s independence not through it surrender mr tajani said the responsibility for this situation is only russian now the kremlin must give concrete signal instead of bombing the population white house official said they were not surprised by russia s reaction to mr biden s comment few on the president s national security team expected anything different from mr putin given russia s behavior in the past several week which ha included strike on infrastructure target that have deprived major city including kyiv of heat light and running water this brutalization of ukraine s people is barbaric secretary of state antony j blinken said at a nato meeting in romania on wednesday mr biden s remark about speaking to mr putin wa not intended the official said to signal a shift in policy or to indicate that the president wa drifting from his commitment to ensuring that ukraine s leadership decided when and how to negotiate an end to the war aide say the president continues to believe that negotiation will be necessary but they also say he doe not believe that direct talk with mr putin will be possible unless the fact on the ground change in his remark on thursday mr biden wa careful to show deference to ukraine and the nato ally saying he would talk to mr putin only after consulting with them first in part the message wa intended to be a show of support for diplomacy by his counterpart mr macron ha stressed the importance of maintaining dialogue with the russian leader if only to avoid dangerous escalation or miscalculation he called mr putin in august and plan to speak with him in a few day olaf scholz the german chancellor spoke to the russian president on friday morning a kremlin readout of the call with mr scholz blamed the west for the absence of talk saying that the western approach of pumping the kyiv regime with weapon and providing it with financial and political support lead kyiv to reject any idea of negotiation but there are other audience to consider a well some leader are anxious about the economic impact of a war that ha driven up food and energy price worldwide and in the united state some republican and progressive democratic lawmaker have expressed frustration that the biden administration which ha provided nearly billion in military aid to kyiv since the russian invasion appears to be writing blank check without describing an end game for the conflict white house official said the president s comment about being willing to meet with mr putin under certain circumstance wa not directly aimed at those group but the remark nonetheless signal that the biden administration ha not foreclosed the possibility of diplomacy even though mr biden ha not spoken to mr putin since mid february mr blinken ha spoken to his counterpart sergey v lavrov only once since mid january to discus the potential release of two american imprisoned in russia paul whelan and brittney griner mr biden also said in october that he would be willing to talk with mr putin about releasing the two american speaking a day before mr biden s comment mr rasmussen the former nato chief said he did not believe that ukraine would accept a peace deal that allowed russia to occupy any part of it territory i can conclude quite confidently that a long a you will see russian troop on ukrainian soil you will have a conflict he said the only off ramp for putin is get out of ukraine

president emmanuel macron of france sought to ease trans atlantic tension over mr biden s domestic manufacturing agenda on thursday with both leader emerging from an official state visit promising to work together on economic policy that have rankled european official mr biden promised to make tweak to a sprawling clean energy law passed earlier this summer that mr macron said wa at risk of fracturing the economic alliance between america and europe official in france and other part of europe have said the law known a the inflation reduction act provides an unfair advantage to u s firm by offering generous tax incentive that encourage north american manufacturing since his arrival in washington on wednesday mr macron ha made clear his displeasure over mr biden s domestic policy including a separate bill to boost u s semiconductor manufacturing known a the chip act the french president warned in a speech at the french embassy on wednesday evening and during an interview on abc s good morning america that the law could hamper relation between the u s and europe and freeze multinational investment on both continent the choice made whose objective i share in particular the inflation reduction act and the chip act are choice that will fragment the west because they create such difference between the united state and europe mr macron said at the embassy event by the time of their joint news conference on thursday afternoon mr biden appeared ready to appease mr macron we re going to continue to create manufacturing job but not at the expense of europe mr biden said adding that he wa going to address glitch in the inflation reduction act yet it is unclear how the president might satisfy mr macron s concern any change to the law which passed with only democratic support would likely require an act of congress such action could soon be hard to come by republican will take control of the house next year and key democrat in the senate have shown little willingness to water down measure they cemented into law in hope of bolstering american manufacturing competitiveness still mr macron appeared pleased with the assurance mr biden gave him in the course of a morning meeting at the white house which included a protracted discussion of mr biden s economic plan we agreed to re synchronize our approach our agenda in order to invest in critical emerging industry mr macron said at the news conference mr biden s plan to boost american manufacturing are part of his administration s effort to position the united state a a leader in reducing the fossil fuel emission driving climate change and to become le reliant on foreign nation for critical material like semiconductor but the biden plan ha fueled anger across europe at a critical moment a the united state try to keep it western ally aligned against russia s war in ukraine crucial ally in that effort are increasingly accusing the united state of undercutting them at the expense of domestic priority those frustration have clouded what had been a trans atlantic effort to starve president vladimir v putin of oil revenue needed to fuel his war in ukraine a looming european ban on russian oil prompted the biden administration to push for a workaround that would allow critical supply of it to continue flowing in order to prevent a spike in global oil price european official reluctantly agreed earlier this year to embrace a u s plan that would impose a cap on how much russia could earn for each barrel it sell determining that price ha divided the european union leaving the issue in limbo just day before the embargo is set to take effect ally frustration with the united state ha been building since this summer when mr biden signed two bill aimed at giving a leg up to american industry the inflation reduction act a sprawling climate and energy law offer incentive to support america s electric vehicle industry and the chip act contains billion in subsidy and tax credit for any global chip manufacturer that chooses to set up new operation or expand existing one in the united state in particular european official view the inflation reduction act a putting their domestic company at a disadvantage addressing those concern and understanding the intent of the law is important so that we keep very strong tie between france europe and the united state bruno le

same benefit the united state ha awarded to canada and mexico mr biden suggested on thursday that one provision of the law which applies to country with which america ha a free trade agreement like canada and mexico wa actually meant to include ally including those without such a trade deal like france or the european union there s a lot we can work out the president said some key lawmaker have expressed reluctance to make any change senator ron wyden the oregon democrat who lead the senate finance committee said that congress had passed the law to stimulate the u s auto industry create american job and tackle climate change at the same time i have no intention of reopening it he said congress value america s partnership with the e u but that cannot mean undermining one of the signature element of our landmark bill the debate over electric vehicle subsidy will be one of the most divisive issue on the agenda a the american and european government hold their latest set of economic meeting in a forum called the trade and technology council beginning dec in washington the united state and the european union set up a task force in october to discus their split over the electric vehicle provision both mr biden and mr macron said thursday they had assigned aide to work closely on that joint effort european business executive say they would have preferred if those conversation had been held before the law wa passed markus j beyrer the director general of businesseurope a group representing company in european country said european were disappointed with the policy which is discriminating against european production in a very important field without this having been talked about in the trade and technology council we have a joint responsibility to find a solution to not allow this issue to poison the relationship he said biden administration official have defended the law and encouraged european leader to join the united state in passing more measure to boost their advanced manufacturing production a part of a concerted fight against china u s official think there is space here for europe and others frankly to take similar step a senior administration official told reporter this week in a background briefing previewing mr macron s visit the task force the official said allowed for conversation with europe to make sure that their approach and our approach end up complementing one another being harmonized with one another it is reasonably friendly m yellen said of the legislation during the new york time s dealbook summit on wednesday we re highly dependent on china for most of the mineral that go into making battery and the objective of the inflation reduction act is to have more adequate supply chain among our friend our trading partner john podesta a senior white house adviser on clean energy innovation and implementation said this week that the united state wa confident that the inflation reduction act did not violate any world trade organization rule we intend upon implementing these provision and look forward to dialogue mr podesta added but we think that not only will these be driver in the u s economy but ultimately these are going to have tremendous benefit across the globe a we drive down the price of clean energy and clean energy technology in it discussion with the european the biden administration ha focused on the other benefit of the new climate legislation for global business and on emphasizing the need for cooperation to combat climate change people familiar with the discussion said privately american official and business leader have also pointed to recent situation in which the european took protectionist trade stance that rankled other government such a the e u s carbon border adjustment mechanism and a proposed digital tax it s rich that president macron is criticizing the united state for not coordinating with europe while brussels ha steadfastly refused to discus a lengthy list of regulation that threaten to discriminate against american company said jake colvin the president of the national foreign trade council which represents major multinational business the split over the automotive industry come a the united state is also seeking europe s help on limiting the kind of advanced technology that china can access globally especially the machinery for producing advanced semiconductor that is marketed globally by dutch firm asml senior u s official have flown to europe in recent week to press e u official and corporate leader to join the united state in tightly restricting export of semiconductor technology to china arguing that china s access to such technology pose a national security threat at her meeting with mr le maire at the group of summit in bali last month m yellen noted that america s relationship with france is critical at such a pivotal time for the global economy she said that she wa open to hearing the concern that european have about the inflation reduction act and trying to address them if possible within the limit of the law that congress passed france is america s oldest friend and ally and we re looking forward to continuing to build on our very strong relationship m yellen said dubai united arab emirate on a clear morning in late october the jewel blue hull of the madame gu one of the world s most luxurious superyachts gleamed it aluminum rail shimmering in the sun worker on the pier said they had recently seen people painting cleaning and generally keeping the ship with it helipad and six guest stateroom in pristine condition in past year such a scene would not have been noteworthy many superyachts come and go from dubai s mina rashid marina best known a the home of the queen elizabeth the trans atlantic ocean liner turned hotel that dominates the waterfront here but russia s war in ukraine ha turned an otherwise routine tableau into a diplomatic battleground between the united state and the united arab emirate an important american ally that ha established itself a a safe haven for russian money and asset out of the reach of u s sanction the million madame gu epitomizes the problem in june the united state designated the vessel which is linked to andrei skoch a russian steel magnate and lawmaker under sanction a blocked property that mean the yacht cannot use american company for it upkeep employ u s citizen or even use the dollar the justice department is now taking step to seize the madame gu according to people with knowledge of the plan but the united state can t seize property in a sovereign nation without permission from it government the emirate which ha taken a friendlier position toward moscow is balking at cooperating with the united state to pursue oligarch american official said the kremlin is also using oligarch controlled company in the emirate to acquire war supply that the west is trying to keep out of russia s reach according to a western official involved in the sanction effort against russia emirati official did not comment specifically on the madame gu but said in a statement that they took their role protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously a closer examination of russian asset in the emirate show that even before the war in ukraine dubai had become a playground for russian with link to president vladimir v putin at least businessmen or official with tie to the russian president own home in dubai that are collectively valued at more than million according to the center for advanced defense study five of those owner are under u s sanction since the russian invasion dubai ha established itself a a safe haven for russian yacht and aircraft unable to sail or fly elsewhere after russian jet were barred from the european union in late february the emirate became the destination for percent of all private flight leaving russia up from percent before the invasion it s frustrating when you see huge asset that are sitting out there and it appears that the country is not cooperating said senator sheldon whitehouse democrat of rhode island referring to the emirate it would be nice if there were more common cause against putin while he s busy shelling hospital and school mr whitehouse is sponsoring legislation that would use proceeds of the sale of seized russian asset to help rebuild ukraine senior official at the treasury and state department have also complained publicly about the situation u s official view the presence of superyachts in place like dubai and bodrum turkey a a symptom of wider russian circumvention of sanction and continued access to financial market yacht have also come to symbolize the decadence of russia s oligarch especially at a time when russian soldier are scrounging for body armor and sleeping bag on the front line built by the dutch firm feadship and put into service in the madame gu ha a large helicopter pad on it forecastle with a hangar underneath that can double a a squash court when the chopper isn t on board the vessel ha berthing for crew member according to one trade magazine mr skoch a member of russia s parliament who is linked to asset worth billion of dollar according to u s court filing ha had sanction imposed on him twice by the united state first in and then after russia s invasion this year the treasury department ha cited his longstanding tie to russian organized criminal group mr skoch could not be reached and did not respond to message left at his office at parliament in an interview in october about the government s broader effort to go after the asset of oligarch andrew adam a federal prosecutor leading the department of justice s kleptocapture task force declined to discus the madame gu but the united state he said is warning company they must not do business with individual and asset under sanction the government he said will pursue oligarch owned asset whose sale could be used to aid ukraine where we know there is an asset that can potentially provide significant remuneration for ukraine that obviously is an attractive case to pursue he said u s official are likely to use the case they made for impounding a million airbus business jet linked to mr skoch in august a a blueprint for seizing the madame gu said people familiar with the plan that mean investigator will aim to show that the owner of the vessel or the company that have been providing service to it have intersected with the u s financial system if there are u s dollar or a u s nexus associated with supporting this vessel massive enforcement action could take place said adam m smith a former official overseeing sanction at the treasury department company that provide support to entity under sanction could potentially face their own sanction said mr smith who is now a lawyer at gibson dunn in washington this year the united state ha carried out two high profile seizure of yacht tied to russian under sanction working with cooperative government the million amadea wa taken in fiji in may and sailed to san diego under an american flag in april the united state worked with spanish police to seize the million tango diplomatically the emirate ha been reluctant to take a clear anti russian position when it come to the war in ukraine sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan president of the united arab emirate recently met with mr putin in st petersburg and the emirati foreign minister recently hosted his russian counterpart yet sheikh mohammed ha also talked with volodymyr zelensky the president of ukraine more than once and recently gave the country million in humanitarian aid the united state ha publicly expressed dismay over the mixed message during a visit to dubai in june wally adeyemo the u s deputy treasury secretary warned of the need for vigilance and proactive step in combating russian evasion that same month barbara leaf the state department s under secretary for near east affair said at a congressional hearing that regarding the emirate she wa not happy at all with the record at this point on sanction enforcement mr adeyemo reiterated his concern in a meeting with emirati official in october in washington a senior state department official said in a statement to the new york time that the agency continues to reinforce the importance of conducting enhanced due diligence to prevent sanction evasion and investigating allegation of such activity to the emirate the treasury department declined to comment on the madame gu or the relationship with the emirate last month the treasury department announced it had placed sanction on an emirate based company constellation advisor ltd that the american government said wa operating on behalf of a nephew of another russian oligarch suleiman kerimov mr kerimov according to american court document wa the owner of the amadea superyacht american official are also worried the russian government is using the emirate to acquire military supply for it war in ukraine on nov the treasury department imposed sanction on two emirate based transportation firm that had worked with another iranian firm under sanction which in turn had helped transport drone and personnel from iran to russia based on a recent visit to dubai s mina rashid marina where the madame gu is moored it is clear that international company are playing a critical role in it care the emirate based company dp world through it subsidiary p o marina oversees the pier where the madame gu is moored employee from another dp world subsidiary world security staff the small guard box at the entrance that make dp world which is owned by dubai s royal family potentially vulnerable to american sanction dp world fully complies with all applicable local and national law and intends to continue doing the same regarding the madame gu and other vessel utilizing our service said adal mirza a spokesman for the company he added that dp world had not yet heard from the united state or other country that had placed mr skoch under sanction including britain and the european union a generator set that dock worker said in late october wa powering the madame gu two container like structure near it stern bore the distinctive orange logo of aggreko a british company the generator set wa connected to the superyacht by thick cord one of the container wa emitting grayish exhaust at the mina rashid marina soon after aggreko wa contacted by the time worker removed the generator having identified that the generator wa being used to power a vessel that is allegedly connected to a sanctioned person we immediately terminated this rental and have since recovered the generator the company said in a statement mr mirza the dp world spokesman said the aggreko generator had been replaced with one from a local supplier p o marina arranged for the diesel generator to provide power for the madame gu because that part of the pier a holding area ha no shore supplied electric power said a port official in dubai who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the press at the end of the day if the u a e hasn t imposed sanction it s not really their job to enforce other country law within their border said nabeel yousef a washington based partner at the law firm

the russian foreign minister insisted that the power grid wa nothing le than a legitimate military target hour after ukrainian official announced that six million people across the country were still without power because of the airstrikes foreign minister sergei v lavrov claimed that russia wa using high precision weapon against energy facility that support combat operation and are used to pump up ukraine with western weapon for it to kill russian the ukrainian military ha said that it force have their own autonomous energy supply and that the strike had no effect on their fighting capability and it is civilian who have borne the brunt of the russian tactic of trying to turn the cold and the dark into weapon of war though how effective it will be may depend on the severity of the looming winter ukraine typically experience frigid winter mean temperature between december and march range from degree fahrenheit minus celsius to degree fahrenheit celsius according to the world bank group though it can get far colder on thursday when the daytime temperature in the capital kyiv hovered around freezing the city s mayor suggested that resident consider a temporary evacuation i

civilian can find warmth light and internet access in a speech this week president volodymyr zelensky attempted to rally the population we will pa this challenge of war a well this winter this russian attempt to use the cold against people he said on thursday british defense intelligence official said the attack on ukrainian infrastructure appeared to be the first time moscow had put into effect a military doctrine adopted in recent year known a the strategic operation for the destruction of critically important target or sodcit russia envisioned sodcit a using long range missile to strike an enemy state s critical national infrastructure rather than it military force to demoralize the population and ultimately force the state s leader to capitulate the british defense ministry said in this case british official said the tactic could be le effective because it wa employed only half a year into the war when russian missile stock have been depleted and the ukrainian population ha been able to prepare still in kherson the battered city where the new infrastructure strike took place the attack are a source of frustration just week ago ukraine reclaimed kherson forcing russian troop to withdraw to the east bank of the dnipro river after a counteroffensive that lasted for month since then russian force have fired hundred of shell across the river at the city a in kyiv the authority have been encouraging resident to leave kherson given the lack of power and water in the city on wednesday the authority said they had restored power to percent of customer only for more strike to reverse the situation russian force on thursday fired shell that hit five settlement in the broader region killing one person and wounding two others said yaroslav yanushevych head of the regional military administration despite the effort of ukrainian engineer and the support of the european union and the united state which have started to deliver both transformer and heavy generator it will take six month to restore the damaged infrastructure according to mr herus the energy official during this winter it is impossible to restore all the damaged facility of the energy infrastructure he said on ukraine s espresso television channel this week the deputy minister of internal affair yevhen yenin said on ukrainian television that a total of city town and village were facing power supply problem because of the attack on thursday brig gen oleksii hromov a member of ukraine s general staff warned of a threat of new missile strike on infrastructure the enemy s goal is to cause panic in the population he said soon after he spoke air raid alarm sounded across the country though they were followed by an all clear in moscow mr lavrov dismissed a laughable suggestion that moscow might be trying to engage kyiv in cease fire negotiation so that it can buy time and replenish it force amid setback on the battlefield we have never asked for any negotiation mr lavrov said but we have always said that if someone is interested in finding a negotiated solution we are ready to listen on thursday president biden said at a news conference at the white house after a meeting with president emmanuel macron of france that he would talk with president vladimir v putin if the russian leader expressed a desire to end his invasion of ukraine mr biden said he would do so however only in consultation with nato ally washington standing beside the french leader who ha championed the need for dialogue with moscow president biden said on thursday that he would talk to president vladimir v putin but only in consultation with nato ally and only if the russian leader indicated he wa looking for a way to end the war mr biden s public expression of conditioned willingness to reach out to mr putin gratified french official and provided unexpected support for president emmanuel macron s outreach mr biden noted that mr putin had shown no interest yet in ending his invasion but said that if that changed i ll be happy to sit down with putin to see what he ha in mind evidently determined to present a united front during a white house news conference that at time resembled a love fest mr macron said that france would increase it military support for ukraine and will never urge ukrainian to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them in effect the two leader met each other halfway with mr biden showing more openness to a negotiated settlement and mr macron more unequivocal support for the ukrainian cause if partially choreographed the meeting of mind appeared to exceed expectation on both side it wa a significant show of trans atlantic unity on the eve of a winter that will put immense strain on the ukrainian people a well a pressure on western economy especially european state scrambling to find new source of energy a price rise sharply french official said that during a three hour closed meeting mr biden and mr macron agreed that more ukrainian battlefield gain would constitute important leverage in any talk with moscow in practice the idea of negotiation seems far fetched at a time when mr putin ha nothing he can call victory and volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president ha military momentum i m not going to do it on my own mr biden said of the possibility of talking to mr putin whose action in ukraine he called sick mr macron wa effusive in his support of ukraine and it right to recover it full sovereignty and there wa no hint of his earlier call for the need to avoid humiliating russia if we want sustainable peace we have to respect the ukrainian to decide the moment and the condition in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future mr macron said the very friendly tone of the two leader throughout reflected the ease they have established in several previous meeting the two leader oozing camaraderie referred to each other a my friend emmanuel and dear joe throughout the day later at a lunch in mr macron s honor at the state department antony j blinken the secretary of state laid out the broader significance of the war in ukraine declaring the post cold war era over he said the world wa in a global competition to define what come next in that struggle he said the united state and france stood shoulder to shoulder in the defense of liberty and democratic society mr macron responded by couching the struggle in ukraine a one that the united state and france could only feel a part of our soul and our root in that it involved fighting for liberty and universal value his tone wa strikingly different from the one he had chosen on wednesday when he sharply criticized mr biden s signature inflation reduction act for potentially killing european job through it massive subsidy for green manufacturing suggesting that this wa a policy that could fragment the west such fragmentation of the alliance a the war enters it th month is precisely what western leader are most concerned about avoiding mr macron s criticism wa sharper than biden administration official had expected on the first day of mr macron s state visit the first accorded to a foreign leader by the biden administration but showing some muscle in the united state is a near necessity for french president who like to say that the mark of the strength of america s oldest alliance is it capacity to accommodate even marked difference at time mr macron warned wednesday of commercial hostility that could break out in the next several week and we do not need that what we need is to go hand in hand a process the french call synchronization today the french president s concern seemed to have evaporated a once again each leader stretched to accommodate the other s preoccupation mr biden said he made no apology for the inflation reduction act and it billion of dollar in government funding for green energy initiative but he appeared eager to ease the french concern saying that the bill had glitch that could be solved there s a lot we can work out he said of the law that provides tax credit for u s automaker that manufacture electric vehicle among a host of other measure mr biden said it wa never intended to exclude folk who are cooperating with u mr macron also moderated his previous criticism saying he had told mr biden of the need to re synchronize their economic partnership to succeed together the combination of the war in ukraine and the need to transition to carbon neutral economy to fight climate change ha placed great pressure on european economy the warmth of the two president toward each other and more broadly in celebrating what mr blinken called the unwavering friendship between the two country came just month after relation collapsed in vitriolic recrimination over a deal mr biden reached with britain to help australia build nuclear powered submarine because the deal scuttled an earlier french contract to supply conventional submarine france saw an anglo saxon plot against it interest mr macron briefly recalled his ambassador to france but relation quickly began to warm again after mr biden called american action clumsy in a joint statement the united state said it would support france s maritime deployment in the indo pacific region and both nation committed to working with china on combating climate change here again past difference seemed to fade a the two leader agreed to coordinate on our concern regarding china s challenge to the rule based international order mr macron ha in the past suggested the united state wa too confrontational toward china and that europe must carve out a more measured position to ensure among other thing that russia not fall into the chinese camp the two leader also said they would focus on the need to bolster europe s defense capability the president recognize the importance of a stronger and more capable european defense that contributes positively to trans atlantic and global security and is complementary to and interoperable with nato the statement from mr macron and mr biden said this wa an evident concession to mr macron s overriding conviction that europe must establish strategic autonomy even if the war in ukraine and america s decisive role in providing much needed weapon to kyiv have shown that the goal remains a chimera for now there is no european army having the u s strongly supporting the ukrainian in that time is very important not just for ukrainian but for the stability of our world today mr macron said for today autonomy wa clearly off the table on the table at a black tie state dinner under a tent on the south lawn of the white house were lobster caviar and even american cheese a test of the open mindedness of the french in celebration of a relationship in which a mr biden said there may be slight difference but never in a fundamental way president biden said thursday he ha no immediate plan to contact russian president vladimir putin and will only speak with him if he is looking for a way to end the war in ukraine it appears he s not going to do that he s paying a very heavy price for failing to do it but he is inflicting incredible incredible carnage on the civilian of ukraine bombing nursery hospital child s home it s sick what he s doing biden said i m prepared to speak with mr putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding and he s looking for a way to end the war he hasn t done that biden said biden stressed that the united state must continue supporting the ukrainian people and said putin miscalculated the response from ukraine but i ll only do so in consultation with my nato ally i m not going to do it on my own biden said biden last spoke with putin on feb before he invaded ukraine on feb they have not had contact since biden attended the g summit this month but avoided a run in with putin biden ha condemned putin a a killer and a war criminal for his ongoing invasion of ukraine this week the biden

should begin to explore a diplomatic settlement to the war now in it th month instead of pressing on with a military solution that could allow the conflict to worsen or drag on this will end when we achieve a victory or when the russian federation decides they want it to end zelensky said it may happen that they will only decide to end the war if they feel they are weak they are isolated and they

putin is trying to deprive them of he said when we have air defense system we will be able to protect this infrastructure from the next russian missile strike and they are definitely to come unfortunately this is the reality that we have to prepare for american and european official say moscow is trying to break the morale of ukrainian by depriving them of basic utility over the winter it embraced the tactic after the russian military began suffering major setback in recent month including being forced to retreat from the southern city of kherson and the kharkiv region in the northeast nato country have so far provided some billion in weaponry to ukraine roughly the size of france s annual defense budget but ukraine ha been tearing through stockpile setting off a scramble to supply the country with what it need while also replenishing nato member own arsenal many western made howitzer are breaking because of heavy use by ukrainian troop official also discussed how to better protect the nato member nation that are closest to ukraine including poland and romania from any potential spillover from the conflict the topic took on a renewed sense of urgency this month when a missile that nato leader said appeared to have been fired by ukraine s air defense system killed two civilian in southeastern poland it wa at a nato summit also in bucharest in that president george w bush forced through a controversial promise that ukraine and georgia would join the alliance some day though when wa not clear germany and france objected arguing that the promise wa an unnecessary provocation to russia four month later mr putin ordered russian troop to invade georgia and some analyst have argued that mr putin ha been trying ever since to make sure that nato s vow to expand to former soviet state prove hollow on tuesday recalling the summit meeting mr stoltenberg said we stand by those decision nato s door is open ukraine however will almost certainly not be joining the alliance anytime soon notwithstanding it longtime ambition to to do so admitting a country requires unanimous consent from all nato member and the alliance predicated on the doctrine of mutual defense is highly unlikely to admit a country already at war the gathering tuesday wa also attended by the foreign minister of sweden and finland which both applied for nato membership after mr putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february in london on tuesday in a speech to british lawmaker ukraine s first lady olena zelenska called on the world to hold russia accountable for atrocity in ukraine she said ukrainian had documented thousand of war crime committed by russia and called for the institution of an international tribunal to prosecute them repeatedly citing world war ii m zelenska recalled that year ago in london the ally signed the declaration that became the basis for the nuremberg trial which brought many perpetrator of nazi war crime to justice victory is not the only thing we need she said we need justice the death of a top official who led belarus s failed attempt to improve it relation with the west came a the country face increasing pressure from moscow to get involved in the war in ukraine that is raging across it border the official vladimir makei served year a the foreign minister of belarus a key geopolitical battleground between russia and the west he died suddenly over the weekend belarusian state medium said on saturday without offering explanation mr makei helped his country s veteran dictator aleksandr g lukashenko in a series of abortive effort to balance moscow s increasingly dominant influence with outreach to the united state and the european union his effort came even a the country became a staging ground for the invasion of ukraine last february shortly after mr makei s death wa reported the exiled colleague of a jailed opposition leader maria kolesnikova said she had been rushed to the intensive care ward of a hospital in western belarus on monday also for unknown reason we don t know what happened we hope there will be more information soon m kolesnikova s sister tatiana khomich said in response to a request for comment she added that the jailed opposition leader had been moved two week ago from a regular prison in the city of gomel to a solitary isolation cell in a different facility the family ha not been allowed to contact her since the move mr makei s sudden death and m kolesnikova s unexplained illness put a spotlight on belarus s highly unpredictable and enigmatic internal dynamic at a time of heightened political tension in the country created by the war in ukraine m kolsenikova ha a reputation a one of mr lukashenko s most resolute and effective opponent she is widely admired for having resisted attempt to forcibly deport her from belarus to ukraine in and for vowing to continue her struggle from inside the country instead of taking refuge abroad like many others this led to her conviction last year on charge of conspiring to seize power illegally a belarusian court jailed her for year mr makei by contrast wa never a dissident but wa a close ally of mr lukashenko still he represented an increasingly rare view among belarusian official that the country needed to reach out to the west and to avoid falling entirely under russia s sway his death which belarusian state medium reported on saturday without giving any cause or the customary tribute stirred a flurry of speculation among commentator exiled opposition activist and ukrainian official about why the diplomat who wa not known to have been suffering any serious health problem had suddenly died one belarusian medium outlet nasha niva said mr makei had died at home in minsk the capital of belarus from a heart attack but other report based on unconfirmed rumor suggested he might have been poisoned no evidence of foul play ha come to light but the rumor reflected the climate of fear and suspicion that according to former belarusian government insider now grip even mr lukashenko s most loyal follower due to the uncertainty created by the war in neighboring ukraine ryhor astapenia the belarus initiative director at chatham house a research organization in london said mr makei wa part of the regime clearly but wa the devil that wa known to the west who made it easier for the west at least to understand the political logic of the regime mr lukashenko he added must now decide whether to choose a replacement foreign minister who can try to talk to the west or he could decide that he doesn t want to engage with the west anymore and submit without question to russia while belarus allowed it territory to serve a a staging ground for russia s invasion it ha resisted pressure from moscow to get more involved by sending it own troop to ukraine mr makei had been scheduled to meet his russian counterpart sergey v lavrov this week and also travel to poland for an annual gathering of the organization for security and cooperation in europe mr lukashenko in power since but increasingly beholden to the kremlin to maintain his position a europe s longest serving leader ha not spoken about mr makei s death or paid tribute to his long service the state news agency belta on saturday published a one line article saying that the president had offered condolence to mr makei s family the foreign minister s last known official meeting wa on friday with the apostolic nuncio in minsk the belarusian capital a person close to the vatican diplomatic service said the nuncio the vatican s equivalent of an ambassador did not notice anything unusual about mr makei s physical condition the foreign minister told the nuncio he wa tired but attributed this to a hectic travel schedule foreign diplomat who had worked with mr makei over the year remembered him a one of the few senior belarusian official who could engage in civil conversation with western leader while remaining a trusted member of mr lukashenko s inner circle makei wa a member of an inner circle of lukashenko from the very beginning first a chief of staff and later a the foreign minister said vygaudas usackas the former foreign minister of lithuania belarus s neighbor to the west but he wa also trying to walk a fine line in term of keeping option and door open to talk to the european union and the west in general until the very last moment while understanding the dependence of the regime on moscow he wa seeking the option of keeping the opening with the west mr usackas added that effort often infuriated russia whose president vladimir v putin ha made the submission of belarus to moscow s will a central part of a long and in the case of ukraine violent campaign to bring the slavic land of the former soviet union to heel moscow wa particularly displeased with a high level american visit to minsk in february by then secretary of state mike pompeo during mr pompeo s visit in which mr makei figured prominently the two country agreed to exchange ambassador and also discussed the export of oil to belarus from the united state and it ally a move that threatened to break russia s energy stranglehold on the east european nation the thaw in relation with washington ended abruptly six month later when mr lukashenko backed by moscow used brutal force to end protest by hundred of thousand of people in minsk and other belarusian city after a rigged presidential election that returned him to office for a sixth term just day before russian troop invaded ukraine in february thrusting toward kyiv the ukrainian capital from belarusian territory mr makei insisted at a meeting with foreign journalist in minsk that russia would not invade and that it troop ostensibly gathered in belarus for training exercise would soon all return home valery kaveleuski a former belarusian diplomat who now life in exile and support the opposition said mr makei s obedience to mr lukashenko meant that he had completely lost his appeal to the west a well a his ability to influence government policy he predicted that his replacement will hold a similar approach that is submissive to russia with extremely limited space for maneuver vi vi the west a foreign minister mr makei led his country s outreach to the west which mr lukashenko had tried playing off against russia in a bid to maintain political power at home a reserve colonel in the army who wa fluent in english and german mr makei wa a rare senior belarusian official who could move between hard liner in the belarusian security service and european diplomatic circle making him a valuable member of mr lukashenko s team said pavel slunkin a belarusian political analyst who had worked under mr makei in the foreign ministry through him lukashenko had found a path to the west said mr slunkin referring to mr makei mr makei s diplomatic effort fell apart after mr lukashenko s violent crackdown on street protest in this failed effort rendered the foreign minister in the eye of many belarusian a symbol of gradual political change that never came said mr slunkin western sanction in response to mr lukashenko s crackdown made belarus increasingly reliant on russia and it president mr putin valery sakhashchyk a former belarusian military officer now serving a an adviser on defense to the exiled opposition leader svetlana tikhanovskaya told ukrainian radio on monday that mr makei s death had removed an official who though deformed by year of service to lukashenko wa undoubtedly some kind of bridge with the west today i am afraid that there is no one to fully replace makei and this may be a problem he said this may cause such consequence that russia will take lukashenka on a very short leash and may turn out badly follow our live coverage of biden hosting macron at the white house paris a if to demonstrate that old alliance prove their worth in time of war president emmanuel macron of france will be feted this week in washington on the first state visit by a foreign leader since president biden took office the gun salute and elaborate reception that will be accorded to mr macron starting wednesday reflect the resilience of the very old but sometimes fractious relationship between france and the united state they also indicate the renewed centrality of europe to american interest since the invasion of ukraine by president vladimir v putin of russia nine month ago a world now living with mr putin s nuclear blackmail is a changed world where the ideal of liberty democracy and universal human right central to both american and french identity are directly threatened the state visit is symbolically significant a the return of the trans atlantic relationship to the center of american strategy in the world and it s notable that the country getting the first nod is france not germany or britain said charles kupchan a professor of international affair at georgetown university mr macron s restlessness a he seek some new security architecture for europe and greater strategic autonomy for the continent rather than continued dependence on the united state for defense ha at time been an irritant to the biden administration but at a moment when the united state need a strong europe it ha no more forceful interlocutor than the french president britain marginalized itself through brexit for which it ha paid a heavy price and rishi sunak the prime minister took office only last month olaf scholz the cautious german chancellor with whom mr macron ha an uneasy relationship ha not yet developed anything resembling the broad european authority of his predecessor angela merkel the war in ukraine will be at the heart of talk between mr biden and mr macron with subtle difference certain to surface both in how to end the fighting and how to share the burden of the conflict s harsh impact on western economy we have a demanding political dialogue in the sense that we are ally who are not aligned if i may put it that way said a senior adviser to mr macron who declined to be named in line with french diplomatic practice mr macron while emphasizing that ukraine recover it full sovereignty and accusing moscow of an imperial invasion ha repeatedly insisted that the war must end at the negotiating table not on the battlefield the french president recently said that he would soon talk again with mr putin a conversation he ha maintained throughout the war president biden ha been more emphatic on the need for ukraine to win the war insisting that only the ukrainian can decide when they should stop fighting although in recent week a winter approach the idea of negotiation ha gained some ground gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chief of staff suggested this month that a dialogue box may have opened with the russian withdrawal from the southern city of kherson but senior official close to mr biden have made clear they do not think the moment is ripe in practice with ukraine ascendant on the battlefield and determined to keep recapturing russian occupied land no avenue for talk seems to exist for the moment the good cop bad cop routine combining mr macron s outreach to moscow with mr biden s resolve that mr putin be denied victory appears likely to endure bolstered by a shared determination to avoid escalation in the week leading up to mr macron s visit french minister and official have expressed growing exasperation with what they see a unfair economic competition from the united state it is only month since france briefly recalled it ambassador to washington in fury at a secretive deal reached by mr biden to help australia deploy nuclear powered submarine the agreement which also involved britain scuttled an earlier french contract to provide conventional submarine intense diplomacy laid the dispute to rest a mr biden called u s action clumsy but other economic difference have since emerged europe ha none of america s self sufficiency in energy and is bearing the brunt of the soaring price the war ha caused a it scramble to find new source of oil and gas in particular france ha taken aim at aspect of the biden administration s inflation reduction act including massive subsidy to american green industry which france belief could lead european company to relocate to the united state we want a loyal and strategic form of competition the adviser to mr macron said the buzzword of french official is synchronization of the economic response to the war china favor it own production america privilege it own production bruno le maire the french economy minister told france television on sunday it s perhaps time that europe favor it own production mr macron s government is determined to push a buy europe campaign the biden administration contends that it legislation will expand the pie for clean energy investment not split it up in way damaging to europe it also expects that even with incentive for domestic manufacturing the u s economy will continue to rely on import of renewable energy technology a task force chaired by senior official from the white house and the european commission ha already been created to engage with europe on it concern about american subsidy something french official have not alluded to over the past week president biden who will soon face a republican controlled house seems very unlikely to budge on one of his signature achievement this will be the second state visit by president macron after former president trump invited him in then he wa a fresh face a young man still hoping in vain to charm mr trump and so sway him toward staying in the iran nuclear deal and the paris climate accord today the sheen is off and mr macron is struggling to give direction to his second term the president still tends to get ahead of himself sometimes and nation on the fringe of russia including poland and the baltic state which knew soviet totalitarian rule do not share his belief that mr putin s russia can somehow be integrated one day into a new european security structure with a surer grip on a highly differentiated europe macron would gain a lot more traction said constanze stelzenm ller the director of the center on the united state and europe at the brookings institution he too often veers toward the philosophical in a way that is politically tone deaf but a the leader who twice won election keeping the extreme right from power and the boldest innovator in europe mr macron is essential to mr biden s core global objective that democracy prevail over autocracy not least russia and china it wa the best of time and the worst of time ukraine she answered it s home she told u he brought u to one of hundred of hip bar restaurant and coffee shop still alive and kicking in kyiv young folk very much aware of the problem swirling around them but still drinking eating laughing holding hand we walked down kyiv street once bright now darkened cavern we were with people huddled around charging point for essential mobile phone we saw line of people waiting to fill bottle of water dispensed from public tap and heard of floor climb to apartment elevator stuck by power outage many cried with u many remembered those lost many broke down from the sheer difficulty of the life imposed on them by russia s dictate but incredibly no one not a single person and we spoke with dozen and dozen this trip said ukraine should give up that it wa just too much that there wa too much suffering that kyiv should hand over to moscow what it demanded another thing we heard a well that a bad a thing were in city like kyiv and lviv they were worse where the men and woman are fighting ukrainian know a brave a they are without the world s help their world a they know it would be finished so a our team leaf this time what is happening in ukraine will remain in our heart and mind knowing we ll no doubt be back for maybe harder time or perhaps some good one a well greg palkot currently serf a a london based senior foreign affair correspondent for fox news channel fnc he joined the network in a a correspondent follow him on twitter gregpalkot german are already stocking up on fresh polish sausage and beer in anticipation of the denouement in ukraine european journalist who visited the opening of the point of invincibility ukrainian place where there should always be electricity communication and the internet in the capital of the independent managed to ridicule the kiev authority there were even caustic headline ex boxer v ex actor klitschko v zelensky we make the bet of the lord in response the president s office found nothing better than actually in the style of brother from the s to run over the capital s power which a everyone know is represented by former boxer vitali klitschko kiev s head did not reflect for a long time but gave out the coming winter for the inhabitant of kiev will be the worst since the second world war the ex boxer is accustomed to responding to an abandoned glove a harshly since he doe not know how to do it any other way the president of ukraine a an ex actor a if not noticing the mayor s hook continued to praise the point of invincibility they say that our according to other source point of invincibility will help million resident of the capital to survive this winter to this klitschko retorted we must prepare for the worst case scenario and he advised citizen to occupy house in the private sector of kiev where it is possible to heat housing with firewood this caused a real panic among those who left these house and left for europe zelensky immediately accused the kiev city authority of profanation of point of invincibility no one will forgive anyone for the profanation with the kiev point of invincibility a well a lie in report of different level please take it more seriously zelensky told ukrainian medium without naming name but everyone immediately understood who this uppercut wa addressed to in the ukrainian medium a if not noticing the fuss between zelensky and klitschko they continue to ridicule tent with bourgeois and generator and at the same time the entire kiev authority commentator from abroad among whom were many fellow countryman of klitschko offered all the townspeople during the first frost to run to bankova to bask under one blanket to the ex actor with the ex boxer but a couple more russian missile attack on ukraine s power supply system and zelensky will really have to give all his love and warmth to the ukrainian people a he doe in his re election program and the ex boxer klitschko beaten by political slap to the ukrainian people who once cut peaceful pole and belarusian will clearly not be enough for belt there are doubt that ukrainian will agree to continue to warm up exclusively on their own or during the demolition of soviet monument honorary plaque from house royal statue and bust but waiting for help from germany and poland after such headline is also no longer worth it german would rather have polish sausage for beer than plaster akhmat sila on the column of the reichstag

russian oil the decree will prohibit doing business with both company and country that have supported the price ceiling it will also be prohibited to load on ship oil destined for any country that accept restriction whatever price range is chosen it is touching that western country have been breaking spear for the second week trying to determine this ceiling for example greece and malta propose to set it at the level of u dollar per barrel excluding the cost of transportation and poland and ukraine insist on buck per barrel calm down right word at least dollar if it is indicated at least a word about the price restriction in the contract you will not get for any money it will be like zhvanetsky let s argue about the taste of oyster with those who ate them to the hoarseness to the fight shmygal and zelensky who lie two completely different assessment on the evening of november were issued by the president of ukraine so far volodymyr zelensky and the prime minister of ukraine denis

reported completely different figure the entire main high voltage infrastructure is working but problem persist in the distribution network of oblenergo throughout the state on average from to thousand consumer are de energized in each region shmygal said and who is right in this situation don t believe it kyiv mayor vitali klitschko at some point an empty refrigerator can beat the tv no matter how much you say that everything is fine with u people will understand that everything is not so good in our country the mayor of the capital of ukraine said on television who prophetically advised ukrainian to prepare for the land in the winter of and explained that in order to get warm water it must be heated and he wasn t listened to the european union gave serbia an ultimatum serbian prime minister ana brnabic said that brussels ha set two mutually exclusive condition for the republic s accession to the eu which serbia must fulfill the first is to impose sanction against russia because russia ha violated the territorial integrity of another state and the second is to recognize the independence of kosovo despite the fact that such recognition is a direct violation of the territorial integrity of serbia itself serb are now in deep bewilderment because they do not know how to simultaneously fulfill two such condition and who to go to to the smart or the beautiful kiev announced a boycott of pace and don t turn off the light the ukrainian delegation to the osce parliamentary assembly ha declared a strike the head of the ukrainian delegation nikita poturaev announced that ukrainian deputy delegate to pace will stop working in this organization until the assembly decides on the suspension of russian representative from participation in pace the delegation decided to boycott the work of ukraine in this international organization until such a solution is found we were also supported by friend and ally from estonia and lithuania who were also present and left the meeting of the standing committee with u poturaev told reporter perhaps ukrainian were simply frightened by the darkness since the final meeting of the autumn session of the osce parliamentary assembly in warsaw began in the dark a a sign of solidarity with ukraine the light were turned off in the hall and ukrainian might have thought that now they would also cut down the heat and become quite like at home kuleba proboltals ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba unexpectedly in an interview with the french edition of le parisien revealed a ukrainian military secret according to him a number of country quietly provide military assistance to kiev supplying ukraine with weapon or purchasing them and sending them through third country most of these third country say publicly that they don t supply anything but behind the scene everything is happening kuleba told reporter and most likely took a promise from them not to share this secret knowledge with anyone it is possible that some such case do occur for example bulgarian arm dealer supplied kiev with shell with an expired shelf life for soviet caliber at a triple price even explosion at factory in bulgaria were staged to hide supply and the westerner had to push through official delivery from march to november and it is not a fact that the consent of the parliament which wa obtained will be implemented down with metal the largest mining and metallurgical plant of ukraine arcelormittal stopped steel smelting and production of rolled product it is announced that this is done due to problem with electricity representative of the company reported that the available volume of electricity are not enough to maintain production even at the level of of capacity and this is in condition when due to the increased cost of electricity in europe it own metallurgical production ha decreased and the eu country are ready to buy more ukrainian metal even despite the increased price and there is nothing to buy a it turned out the mayor of kharkiv is ready for a fine the mayor of this city igor terekhov who wa fined for addressing the resident of kharkiv in russian language said that he would continue to communicate with the resident of the city in russian language which is native to of the local population but he stressed that this doe not affect the level of his ukrainian patriotism today the most important thing for u is to win no matter what language we speak terekhov promised stubborn but bad after all if these people win then you the mayor will no longer be fined they will just shoot and throw them into a pit a in the same kupyansk they won t even bury it for the edification of others one line director of the institute of sociology of the national academy of science of ukraine yevhen golovakha announced that according to the poll of his institution vladimir putin ha ceased to be the most popular politician in ukraine yes quit it s temporary about half of the invincibility point in

country stopped accepting hryvnia cash for exchange for franc and where to go now with these hryvnia not to return to ukraine british defense secretary ben wallace at a meeting in kiev with zelensky without taking his hand out of his pocket said that the armed force of ukraine should undertake a decisive offensive in the winter since they were provided with arctic equipment and they are well trained they will still bill for each rag if there is anyone according to western expert about a third of the howitzer supplied by the west to ukraine are no longer suitable for firing and require urgent repair the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want journalist of the new york time wrote about the difficult situation of the north atlantic alliance in short it turned out that the army of the west are not ready for a real big confrontation nato is used to nightmarishing poor country like afghanistan and there is simply no need for a lot of weapon a nato spokesman told u s reporter that the small country of the bloc have fully exhausted their potential and of the member have significantly exhausted themselves although the richest the united state france germany italy are still able to support kiev but even then paris handed over to ukraine caesar howitzer and this is already a fifth of all stock of such gun in the country and france will not give them to zelensky anymore you have to u s reserve in europe have also almost run out and they are not going to replenish them yet it is more important for washington to keep reserve near china and north korea and not near ukraine it turn out that we are no longer fighting with the entire alliance but only with it main country whose reserve turned out to be thicker the nyt wrote that in nato the european military is jokingly called the bonsai army like tiny japanese tree because there are shell for cannon air defense missile ammunition in the eu but they are few in afghanistan according to a new york newspaper nato could fire cannon a day now ukraine alone produce thousand shell per day and our army according to nato military estimate spends thousand round of ammunition per day at the same time in the entire united state thousand of them are made per month in general the modern battlefield turned out to be too much for the anglo saxon general and then there s the commerce it turned out that shell from one country of the bloc are not suitable for the same type of weapon from another take the same heavy gun yes the caliber of all is standard mm but the german shell will not fit into the french howitzer so manufacturer guarantee that they will be able to sell ammunition for their weapon a printer manufacturer make money on branded cartridge the best interviewer of radio komsomolskaya pravda talk with those who have something to say subscribe to new episode and listen whenever you want brussels when the soviet union collapsed european nation grabbed the peace dividend drastically shrinking their defense budget their army and their arsenal with the rise of al qaeda nearly a decade later terrorism became the target requiring different military investment and lighter more expeditionary force even nato s long engagement in afghanistan bore little resemblance to a land war in europe heavy on artillery and tank that nearly all defense ministry thought would never recur but it ha in ukraine the kind of european war thought inconceivable is chewing up the modest stockpile of artillery ammunition and air defense of what some in nato call europe s bonsai army after the tiny japanese tree even the mighty united state ha only limited stock of the weapon the ukrainian want and need and washington is unwilling to divert key weapon from delicate region like taiwan and korea where china and north korea are constantly testing the limit now nine month into the war the west s fundamental unpreparedness ha set off a mad scramble to supply ukraine with what it need while also replenishing nato stockpile a both side burn through weaponry and ammunition at a pace not seen since world war ii the competition to keep arsenal flush ha become a critical front that could prove decisive to ukraine s effort the amount of artillery being used is staggering nato official say in afghanistan nato force might have fired even artillery round a day and had no real worry about air defense but ukraine can fire thousand of round daily and remains desperate for air defense against russian missile and iranian made drone a day in ukraine is a month or more in afghanistan said camille grand a defense expert at the european council on foreign relation who until recently wa nato s assistant secretary general for defense investment last summer in the donbas region the ukrainian were firing to artillery round each day a senior nato official said the russian were firing to round per day by comparison the united state produce only round each month so the west is scrambling to find increasingly scarce soviet era equipment and ammunition that ukraine can use now including s air defense missile t tank and especially soviet caliber artillery shell the west is also trying to come up with alternative system even if they are older to substitute for shrinking stock of expensive air defense missile and anti tank javelin it is sending strong signal to western defense industry that longer term contract are in the offing and that more shift of worker should be employed and older factory line should be refurbished it is trying to purchase ammunition from country like south korea to backfill stock being sent to ukraine there are even discussion about nato investing in old factory in the czech republic slovakia and bulgaria to restart the manufacturing of soviet caliber mm and mm shell for ukraine s still largely soviet era artillery armory but the obstacle are a myriad a the solution being pursued nato country often with great fanfare have provided ukraine some advanced western artillery which u nato standard mm shell but nato system are rarely certified to use round produced by other nato country which often make the shell differently that is a way for arm manufacturer to ensure that they can sell ammunition for their gun the way printer manufacturer make their money on ink cartridge and then there is the problem of legal export control which govern whether gun and ammunition sold to one country can be sent to another one at war this is the reason the swiss claiming neutrality refused germany permission to export to ukraine needed antiaircraft ammunition made by switzerland and sold to germany italy ha a similar restriction on arm export one nato official described the mixed bag of system that ukraine must now cope with a nato s petting zoo given the prevalence of animal name for weapon like the gepard german for cheetah and the surface to air missile system called the crotale french for rattlesnake so resupply is difficult a is maintenance the russian too are having resupply problem of their own they are now using fewer artillery round but they have a lot of them even if some are old and le reliable facing a similar scramble moscow is also trying to ramp up military production and is reportedly seeking to buy missile from north korea and more cheap drone from iran given the russian annexation of crimea in and the war in the donbas region nato s new military spending goal percent of gross domestic product by with percent of that on equipment instead of salary and pension seem modest but even those were largely ignored by key member country in february when the war in ukraine began stockpile for many nation were only about half of what they were supposed to be the nato official said and there had been little progress in creating weapon that could be used interchangeably by nato country even within the european union only percent of defense expenditure by nation are cooperative for nato country that have given large amount of weapon to ukraine especially frontline state like poland and the baltic the burden of replacing them ha proved heavy the french for instance have provided some advanced weapon and created a million euro fund about million for ukraine to buy arm made in france but france ha already given at least modern caesar howitzer to ukraine about percent of all of it existing artillery and is reluctant to provide more the european union ha approved billion billion to repay member state for what they provide to ukraine but that fund the european peace facility is nearly percent depleted in total nato country have so far provided some billion in weaponry to ukraine roughly the size of france s annual defense budget smaller country have exhausted their potential another nato official said with of it member pretty tapped out but the remaining can still provide more he suggested especially larger ally that would include france germany italy and the netherlands nato s secretary general jens stoltenberg ha advised the alliance including pointedly germany that nato guideline requiring member to keep stockpile should not be a pretext to limit arm export to ukraine but it is also true that germany and france like the united state want to calibrate the weapon ukraine get to prevent escalation and direct attack on russia the ukrainian want at least four system that the west ha not provided and is unlikely to long range surface to surface missile known a atacms that could hit russia and crimea western fighter jet western tank and a lot more advanced air defense said mark f cancian a former white house weapon strategist who is now a senior adviser at washington s center for strategic and international study the atacms with a range of some mile will not be given for fear they could hit russia the tank and fighter jet are just too complicated requiring a year or more to train in how to use and maintain a for air defense mr cancian said nato and the united state deactivated most of their short range air defense after the cold war and there is little to go around producing more can take up to two year maintenance is key but there are clever answer for relatively simpler equipment like the m howitzer given to ukraine with the right part a ukrainian engineer can link up to an american artillery officer in fort sill okla and get talked through maintenance over zoom ukraine ha also proved adaptable it force are known inside nato a the macgyver army a reference to an old television series in which the hero is inventive and improvisational with whatever come to hand to shell russian position at snake island for instance the ukrainian put caesar with a kilometer range on barge and towed them out kilometer to hit the island which wa kilometer away astonishing the french ukraine also sank the moskva the flagship of the russian black sea fleet with it own adapted missile and ha built drone that can attack ship at sea american official insist that the u s military still ha enough mat riel to continue supplying ukraine and defend u s interest elsewhere we are committed to providing ukraine with what it need on the battlefield sabrina singh the pentagon s deputy press secretary said this month after announcing more stinger missile for ukraine washington is also looking at older cheaper alternative like giving ukraine anti tank tow missile which are in plentiful supply instead of javelin and hawk surface to air missile instead of newer version but official are increasingly pushing ukraine to be more efficient and not for example fire a missile that cost at a drone that cost already some weapon are running low a of september the u s military had a limited number of mm artillery round in it stockpile and limited number of guided rocket rocket launcher howitzer javelin and stinger according to an analysis by mr cancian the shortage in mm artillery shell is probably the big one that ha the planner most concerned mr cancian said if you want to increase production capability of shell he said it s going to be probably four to five year before you start seeing them come out the other end a week earlier one of the leading polish medium admitted that not only polish mercenary are fighting in ukraine but also active serviceman of the polish army whose number already clearly exceeds bayonet at least two full fledged brigade and this once again prof that russia in the annexed territory of ukraine is opposed not so much by ukraine itself but by the entire nato bloc the already well armed ukrainian army received hundred of tank and bmps armored vehicle and attack drone high precision long range artillery system and multiple launch rocket system mlrs anti tank complex and stinger manpad and in late summer early september delivery of heavy air defense system began kiev is pumped with weapon by the usa great britain germany france italy canada the czech republic slovakia poland latvia lithuania estonia spain bulgaria who is not there in this teremochka but only one weapon is not enough and nato member country train ten of thousand of ukrainian military personnel in military affair and tactic of warfare in different condition at their military base and training ground and also send their specialist who directly work on modern high precision complex for example kiev ha repeatedly admitted that not only the target of strike from the heimars mlrs are coordinated with the united state and in fact it is the pentagon that indicates these target but also the american instructor sent to ukraine command the crew of these very serious combat vehicle and in recent day it ha become known that behind the lever of many of the t tank sent from poland are not at all the ukrainian military nato itself doe not get tired of stressing that the bloc is not interested in a direct clash with russia but they have increasingly begun to speak out for example nato secretary general jens stoltenberg evolved in his statement from march to october from the attitude nato simply support kiev and only help it defend the right to self defense to recognition on october at an open press conference it is important for all of u that ukraine win this battle after all if putin win it will not only be a great defeat for the ukrainian but also a defeat and a dangerous outcome for all of u and here to understand what is happening now you will have to delve a little deeper into recent history russia wa not interested in annexing the territory of ukraine initially moscow s main request wa the demand not to bring nato s border closer to those with russia but the alliance continued to bend it line developing plan to build new military base in the same ukraine moscow wa quite satisfied with neutral country a a kind of gasket between russia and nato member country but when at the summit in the west promised to accept ukraine and georgia a member of it member the question arose in this way if there is no neutral territory and nato go directly to the russian border then the border with the bloc should be pushed back a much a possible the first test of nato s pen in georgia failed and georgia which staged a provocation according to western pattern in now show despite the constant rhetoric about the occupied territory that tbilisi ha learned this lesson it wa after this that nato chose another path of invasion more traditional for the west through ukraine and at first the southern option wa chosen to threaten russia from the crimean peninsula and here moscow worked proactively depriving nato of the prospect of turning the peninsula into an unsinkable aircraft carrier the frank aggressive hostility of the neighbor left no other choice just the other day the inspector general of the bundeswehr general eberhard zorn threw away the cover tinsel in his secret report in which he stated that a direct conflict on the eastern flank of nato ha again become more likely and germany should play the role of a pioneer in europe and strengthen it armed force roughly speaking a direct war between germany and therefore nato and russia that s just with the pioneer general zorn clearly overreacted germany already had such a pioneer who in led his country to disaster and committed suicide however the message of the german general is more than clear implicitly this war between russia and nato not just ukraine is already underway and kiev ha repeatedly admitted that having lost the support and assistance of the west primarily military the zelensky regime would not have lasted even a month and russia is now actually alone leading western country and several dozen other country participate in various nato program successfully resisting this entire bloc suffice it to say that since the beginning of the cvo ukraine ha received a colossal amount of military assistance but the effectiveness of it use by kiev raise more and more question in the west at the same time do not be deceived nato general really want to include the military force of the bloc in the conflict acting on the side of ukraine then what s stopping them after all just a few day ago ukraine hit the territory of poland with it missile and tried to shift the blame for this on moscow it would seem that a more convenient pretext can not be invented to use the th paragraph of the nato charter on collective defense and zelensky in kiev clearly counted on this option of continuing the banquet but the hothead in nato had to cool down the western politician themselves it s one thing to attack an exhausted and exhausted russia and it is quite another to fight with a well established mechanism which with smaller force compared to the enemy took control of more than of the enemy s territory even the part of the army that moscow used in ukraine did not suffer catastrophic loss in the offensive which could be compared with the monstrous loss of the armed force of ukraine and the vaunted equipment produced by nato country did not help much but not only the remnant of the arsenal of the time and production of the ussr but also new weapon are supplied to the independent country by the way the same old tank produced in the country of the socialist community that remained in the west have undergone a deep modernization and they have quite modern fire control system and other stuffing not to mention the fact that ukraine ha become the main testing ground for new weapon of nato country that have not yet been tested if russia suddenly ran out of missile tank and airplane there is no doubt that the army of nato country would have already been drawn into the conflict to the fullest and unleashed a full scale war but so far the russian army is experiencing a shortage of missile only in the dream of ukrainian talking head and in the speech of western politician who carry complete nonsense about chip from washing machine designed for a stupid undemanding consumer and real analyst whose voice is becoming more and more audible pay attention to the fact that russia s weapon stockpile are more than serious and the russian economy having stood on the military track began to produce military product in four shift fighting in ukraine in tenth if not le part of it force and a long a this picture remains that way nato will simply not dare to openly attack our country article of nato s washington treaty known a the principle of collective defense obliges all member country to come to the aid of another member whose sovereignty or territorial integrity is under threat the war in ukraine ha dragged on for nearly a year far outstripping what russian president vladimir putin thought of ukraine s defense or nato s ability to remain a united front a nato s eastern flank you re on the front line of our collective defense biden said to b leader and you know better than anyone what s at stake in this conflict not just for ukraine but for the freedom of democracy throughout europe and around the world while ukraine ha contributed to nato operation and mission in bosnia herzegovina kosovo iraq afghanistan and elsewhere this is not enough to warrant the full protection of all nato nation while nato ha pledged to back ukraine with defensive aid to win the war against russia it ha stopped short of sending in boot on the ground a stipulation only afforded to the member nation though the nato charter stipulates that no nation can be fully considered or accepted a a member while it is engaged in conflict we are not alone in this endeavor he added security official are greatly concerned by the threat china s participation in the war would bring a it would not only change the dynamic on the battlefield in ukraine but would force european nation to cut economic tie and further strain relation between china and the west this geopolitical divide between democracy and autocracy would create it own challenge particularly a it relates to security concern over taiwan we must break the cycle of russian aggression stoltenberg warned we don t know when the war will end but when it doe we need to ensure that history doe not repeat itself caitlin mcfall is a reporter at fox news digital covering politics u s and world news
