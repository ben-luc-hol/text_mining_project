It was the largest of the attacks in recent weeks.""Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine with 81 missiles and 8 Shahed drones. [Thirty-four] cruise missiles and 4 drones were shot down by Ukraine's air defense. [Eight] [Russian] missiles missed their targets,"" the Ukrainian Defense Department said.As a result of the attack, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, previously conquered by Russian troops, lost power, according to nuclear state operator Energoatom.According to Energoatom, the nuclear plant relies on 18 diesel generators, which can run the station for 10 days. This is the sixth time the plant has suffered a blackout after it became occupied by Russian troops months ago.The Zaporizhzhia plant has been subject to international concern as a potential explosion or meltdown could result in unprecedented destruction to the surrounding areas.""The countdown has begun,"" Energoatom said.Lviv Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said five people were killed in the Lviv region and three buildings were destroyed. The number of fatalities could climb as rescue workers are continuing to comb through the rubble, he said.Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Serhii Lysak said a sixth person was killed, and two others were wounded in multiple strikes across the region.Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko also said residential buildings were hit and several power lines were damaged. In addition, at least six missiles and one drone were shot down.Three power stations owned by private electricity operator DTEK were also reportedly struck during the attack. There were no casualties, but the equipment was severely damaged, the company said.Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said three people were wounded in the city’s Sviatoshynskyi district and infrastructure, and vehicles in the city were also destroyed.""We woke up from the explosion, it was very loud and we saw the cars burning,"" said Maryna Kuryluk, a 49-year-old resident.An alarm remained in Kyiv overnight and into the early morning hours. It was lifted just before 8 a.m.Russia’s missile barrage came as its forces advanced into Ukraine’s Bakhmut, where the two sides have fought for six months. Much of the city has been destroyed or reduced to ash.The attack also came after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Kyiv for talks with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on keeping Ukrainian shipping ports open to ship grain from its Black Sea ports.Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko condemned the missile strikes as ""another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine,"" mentioning on social media that facilities in Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions had been targeted.The last massive barrage took place on Feb. 16.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Although it won nearly twice as many votes Sunday as the election's runner-up, the far-right populist Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, or EKRE, Kallas needs junior partners to form a Cabinet that can govern with a comfortable majority for the next four years.The emergence of parliament newcomer Estonia 200, a centrist party advocating liberal values, was the biggest surprise of the election. It won 13.3% of the vote and 14 seats in Estonia’s 101-seat parliament, or Riigikogu. The Reform Party won 37 seats and the Social Democrats nine.Estonia 200, which defines itself as a ""progressive and forward-looking political party,"" failed to exceed the 5% threshold needed to enter the Riigikogu in 2019. This time, the party gathered an array of well-known Estonian cultural figures, academics, business people and politicians as candidates.According to Estonia 200 chairman Lauri Hussar, the common denominator of the three parties lies primarily in the spirit of reform.National security in the wake of neighboring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and socio-economic issues, particularly the rising cost of living, were the main campaign themes of the election.EKRE which ran largely on an anti-immigration and anti-EU platform, was part of Estonia’s government in 2019-21."

She also applauded the work of the average Ukrainian amid the ongoing war.""We are a force and we can continue to change the world,"" Zelenska said at the Forbes 30/50 Summit via a translator.Zelenska's trip to the United Arab Emirates capital comes as the UAE remains one of the few direct routes out of Moscow — for both people fleeing conscription and for the wealthy who want to park their money in a nation with access to Western financial markets.Already, the U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns with the Russian money flowing into Dubai's red-hot real estate market. Meanwhile, the superyachts of Russian oligarchs also have repeatedly turned up in the Emirates since the start of Moscow's war on Ukraine last year.However, the UAE has voted against Russia's invasion at the United Nations and has donated humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the war began. Her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has held multiple calls with UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Meanwhile, the UAE hosted the prisoner exchange that freed WNBA star Brittney Griner and Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December.Zelenska arrived in the UAE on Tuesday and met with Sheikh Mohammed at Qasr al-Bahar in Abu Dhabi, the country's capital.

Cory Mills took aim at President Biden for his handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan – arguing the president placed ""political optics"" over military strategy in the chaotic final months of America's longest war.""Biden's administration originally said they'd be out by Sept. 11, trying to utilize this date for political optics above military strategy,"" Mills, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital Tuesday.Mills, a veteran of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division who spent seven years in Iraq and nearly three years in Afghanistan, became personally involved in the withdrawal mission. Despite running a congressional campaign at the time, Mills assembled a team to help him evacuate an American mother from Texas and her three children who were stranded in Afghanistan.But when the team Mills assembled attempted to land in Afghanistan for the extraction, they were denied the ability to use the runway they had previously been approved for. Subsequent attempts to land were also denied, with American leaders on the ground threatening to arrest the passengers if they landed and revoke the license of the pilot.They duped a Taliban guard by convincing him that the woman was his wife and the children were his, Mills added. The congressman said such extraordinary measures would not have been necessary if the withdrawal from Afghanistan were better planned, pointing to the closure of Bagram Air Base as an example of failed leadership.Mills also pointed to the release of thousands of ""known terrorists"" from Bagram Detention Center, arguing the decision led to the deadly Aug. 26 attack on American forces at an airport gate in Kabul, killing 13 U.S. service members.""I think the critical failure was always the idea of putting politics and optics above strategy, that the real intent wasn't just to try and save all the Americans or allies who we've made promises to over the past two plus decades,"" Mills said. The administration quickly began boasting about ""the most successful airlift operation"" in U.S. history but left many Americans and allies behind while ""60 to 70%"" of those evacuated from Kabul were ""never vetted,"" Mills said.Worse yet, Mills argued, the chaotic failure of the final days of America's longest war could have been avoided had the administration stuck to the terms of the deal bargained with the Taliban under the Trump administration. He noted that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had set conditions for what the Taliban had to do in order for American forces to leave, and those obligations were not being met. Despite that, Biden broadcast the U.S. timeline withdrawal to the Taliban.""I think we made some critical and fatal flaws, not to mention the fact that one of the grand flaws in my opinion is that you left 80-plus billion dollars in weapons and armor, defense articles, and millions of dollars and pallets of cash,"" Mills said.Mills argued the blame for the failure falls on Biden, who as commander in chief had the final say in all decisions made.""This botched withdrawal ultimately led to our adversaries coming more aggressive toward us because they looked at this as a massive failure on a world stage level, and we know that weakness invites aggression,"" Mills argued.Mills pointed out that not only will Afghanistan be allowed to become a safe haven for terrorism once again, but also that the ramifications are already being felt when it comes to dealing with other geopolitical foes such as China and Russia.""There's truly a lot that has come out of this that has essentially damaged our credibility on the world stage and makes many of our allies and others look at us and whether we're truly a world leader any longer,"" Mills said.Mills argued that hearings beginning this week, taking place after the Republican takeover of Congress this year, are an opportunity to examine the critical questions surrounding the failures in Afghanistan while giving the American people answers on what went wrong in the war's final days."

Marsha Blackburn called key impeachment witness Vindman an 'opportunist,' while he fired back at her accusations","Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who made waves as a witness during the first impeachment proceedings of former President Donald Trump, is now being accused of trying to profit off the war in Ukraine by pitching lucrative defense contracts through his private company.In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who was one of the sharpest critics of Vindman throughout the impeachment investigation, blasted him as an ""opportunist,"" and accused him of undertaking continuous efforts to try and personally profit from his attacks against the Trump administration to his reported dealings in Ukraine.The first impeachment of Trump centered around a July 2019 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine—specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses, including Vindman, cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.""When conservatives speak the truth, the mainstream media panics and desperately attempts to provide cover for the left. They did this for Alexander Vindman, just like they did for Hunter Biden, Dr. Fauci and teachers unions,"" Blackburn said, referencing liberal media outlets' staunch defense of Vindman throughout his time as a witness during the impeachment investigation.""Alexander Vindman has always been a political activist and opportunist masquerading behind his career. He saw an opening for personal fame and profited by exploiting the media’s outrage against President Trump,"" she accused.""Vindman has spent the last three years on MSNBC and CNN attacking Republicans. Now, new revelations suggest Vindman could be profiting off the war in Ukraine, just as he did by speaking out against the Trump administration,"" Blackburn added.According to a report by Human Events, a conservative digital newspaper, Vindman has been pitching the government of Ukraine to obtain defense contracts through Trident International LLC, of which he is the CEO.The report stated that last year, Vindman, who was born in Ukraine, pitched a project worth $12 million that his company said would address the country's problems with managing the readiness, repair and maintenance of its weapons systems by developing a center within the country to essentially operate as a middle-man between NATO and the Ukrainian military.It's unclear, however, if the project has been approved as the report stated court documents showed there was an ongoing dispute over payments related to the project.According to Breitbart News, Vindman appeared to confirm Human Events' report in a now deleted tweet.""Thanks for the advert. I’m trying to get logistics in place to help Ukraine win the war and secure America. Looking for philanthropic contributions to get it going. Reach out if you support the cause of democracy and US National Security,"" Vindman allegedly tweeted.Speaking with Fox News Digital, Vindman responded to the accusations by blasting Blackburn, accusing her of lying and contributing to him ultimately leaving the military.""Ooh, Blackburn. She’s an idiot, an agent of chaos promoting disinformation. She has never said one true thing about me. Her attacks in 2019/20 contributed to an environment that made it impossible for me to continue my nonpartisan military service,"" Vindman said.""More importantly, it’s the politicization of Ukraine, by the fringe right, that brought about this war, imperiling Ukraine, Europe, and most importantly the U.S.,"" he added.Fox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.Brandon Gillespie is an associate editor at Fox News.

The U.S. Defense Department had previously recommended against sending the Abrams vehicles, arguing the German Leopard 2 tanks were better suited to the conflict.The U.S. has long resisted sending warplanes to Ukraine, including Soviet-era jets from neighboring nations like Poland, over concerns it could escalate the war beyond Ukraine’s boundaries.While Germany's Leopard 2 tanks will reach the front lines of Ukraine in a matter of weeks, it will take months for Ukrainian troops to be trained on how to use and maintain Abrams tanks.Fox News' Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

They identified populations whose differing levels of radiation exposure may have made them genetically distinct from one another and other dogs worldwide.""We've had this golden opportunity"" to lay the groundwork for answering a crucial question: ""How do you survive in a hostile environment like this for 15 generations?"" said geneticist Elaine Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the study’s many authors.Fellow author Tim Mousseau, professor of biological sciences at the University of South Carolina, said the dogs ""provide an incredible tool to look at the impacts of this kind of a setting"" on mammals overall.Chernobyl’s environment is singularly brutal. On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire at the Ukraine power plant caused radioactive fallout to spew into the atmosphere. Thirty workers were killed in the immediate aftermath while the long-term death toll from radiation poisoning is estimated to eventually number in the thousands.Researchers say most of the dogs they are studying appear to be descendants of pets that residents were forced to leave behind when they evacuated the area.Mousseau has been working in the Chernobyl region since the late 1990s and began collecting blood from the dogs around 2017. Some of the dogs live in the power plant, a dystopian, industrial setting. Others are about 9 miles or 28 miles away.At first, Ostrander said, they thought the dogs might have intermingled so much over time that they’d be much the same. But through DNA, they could readily identify dogs living in areas of high, low and medium levels of radiation exposure.""That was a huge milestone for us,"" said Ostrander. ""And what’s surprising is we can even identify families"" – about 15 different ones.Now researchers can begin to look for alterations in the DNA.""We can compare them and we can say: OK, what’s different, what’s changed, what’s mutated, what’s evolved, what helps you, what hurts you at the DNA level?"" Ostrander said. This will involve separating non-consequential DNA changes from purposeful ones.Scientists said the research could have wide applications, providing insights about how animals and humans can live now and in the future in regions of the world under ""continuous environmental assault"" – and in the high-radiation environment of space.Researchers have already started on the follow-up research, which will mean more time with the dogs at the site about 60 miles from Kyiv. Mousseau said he and his colleagues were there most recently last October and didn’t see any war-related activity. Mousseau said the team has grown close to some dogs, naming one Prancer because she excitedly prances around when she sees people."

She added that the possible arming of Ukraine represented a ""serious question"" for Serbian-Russian relations.The media reports said a Serbian state arms factory recently delivered some 3,500 missiles for the Grad multiple rocket launchers used by both the Ukrainian and Russian armed forces. The 122 mm rockets were allegedly transported to Ukraine via Turkey and Slovakia.Serbian Defense Minister Milos Vucevic has denied the country exported the missiles to Ukraine but left open the possibility they could have gotten there via a third party.""If private companies buy weapons in third states’ markets and then sell them to other companies in other countries, that is not a question for Serbia, that is international trade,"" he said.Serbia is Moscow’s closest ally in Europe, with historic, religious and cultural ties that are bolstered by decades of pro-Russian propaganda campaigns in the Balkan country.Russia backs Serbia’s claim over its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 with Western support. And Serbia has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow over the invasion.Western officials fear Russia could use simmering tensions in Kosovo to try to destabilize the Balkans and avert some attention from the invasion of Ukraine."

None has yet been identified.Ukrainian authorities are still unearthing people who were hastily buried in makeshift graves during Russia's brief but brutal occupation of villages and towns near Kyiv. Almost 200 bodies remain unidentified, while 280 people are listed as missing.Oleksander Pinchuk’s mother, Halyna, is among them. They never found her body in the wreckage of her apartment building, which took a direct hit from an airstrike a year ago. Pinchuk had walked out of the building just eight hours earlier, and has not seen his mother since, he said.On Thursday, Pinchuk stood in the winter chill, grim-faced among a small group of mourners who gathered for a religious service to commemorate the anniversary of the strike in the town of Borodyanka.Nothing remains of the structure except the outline of where it once stood. Behind it is another apartment building, blackened and empty but still standing.Pinchuk said rescue crews only managed to get to the building last April, after Ukrainian forces retook control of Borodyanka. The crews dug through the rubble for about two weeks and located the remains of 15 people. But they found no trace of dozens more believed to have been inside the 108-apartment building.""We still have hope for at least some of them, but the rest, they just burned alive,"" Pinchuk said, his gaze fixed, the pain of loss visible in his eyes.Without a body to mourn over and bury, the 43-year-old hopes against hope that his mother is still alive. He heard rumors that Russian troops took more than 100 people from Borodyanka to Belarus. Perhaps she was among them.""Until the last moment, I will think of her as alive,"" he said.The exhumation of the three bodies Thursday from two makeshift graves on the edge of Borodyanka’s cemetery meant that some families may have a chance to learn what became of their loved ones.A passer-by found the three in early March 2022, when Russia forces still occupied the town, and he buried the bodies with the help of another man, according to Andrii Nebytov, the head of the Kyiv region's police department.The passer-by then fled the region. He only just recently returned and told authorities about the burials, the police chief said.One of the dead is believed to be a 50-year-old local man who was shot and partially burned in his car, but DNA tests are needed to confirm that. Nobody knows who the other two are.There’s not much to go on to identify them. A green pencil is all that was found on one, packets of cigarettes and key fobs on another. The remains are so decomposed that identification and determining exactly how they died will require forensic tests.The exhumations bring the number of civilian bodies found in previously Russian-occupied areas of the Kyiv region to 1,373, Nebytov said. Of that number, 197 have yet to be identified."

She was injured last year when her vehicle hit a land mine, and she helped save the life of a wounded Ukrainian colleague.""We were about 10 to 15 kilometers behind enemy lines on a reconnaissance mission when our vehicle hit an anti-tank mine,"" she said.

He's sitting in Moscow and shelling out orders, but he doesn't seem to understand, or at least he doesn't seem to care what it's actually like on the frontlines,"" she said. Anttila has one message for Putin.""Get out of Ukraine, stop trampling on people's freedoms, respect the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people, and just do the next right thing,"" she urged.Anttila added she intends to return to Ukraine until Putin's forces are finally banished."

Germany so far has been unable to persuade the Swiss to provide supplies from their stockpile of ammunition for Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns that Berlin provided to Ukraine.The ministry, in an emailed response to a query after Swiss daily Blick reported on the request, didn't specify how many tanks Germany would like to buy. Switzerland has 230 of the German-made Leopard 2 tanks, 96 of which aren't in operation, according to German news agency dpa.Amherd this week responded to the German government that any sale would require a decision by the Swiss parliament to declare the tanks officially removed from service, and that while there are discussions in parliament, no such decision has yet been made.Her ministry said that the army has determined that in principle it would be possible to do without a ""limited number"" of battle tanks.Germany is providing 18 of its own military's Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, and they are expected to be delivered later this month. Together with tanks provided by Sweden and Portugal, they will make up a battalion. Poland and other countries also are providing Leopard 2 tanks.Germany's defense minister has pushed for the tanks to be replaced as quickly as possible.German Defense Ministry spokesman Arne Collatz confirmed Germany's interest in the tanks from Switzerland but said there had been no discussion yet of how many tanks might be involved.Asked whether similar queries were made to other countries, Collatz replied that ""we are in constant contact and good talks with many partners."" He didn't elaborate."

The official was not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is still being finalized.The EU has been helping Ukraine through its European Peace Facility — a fund being used to reimburse member countries that provide weapons, ammunition and military support to Ukraine.Under the latest proposal, member countries providing ammunition immediately would be guaranteed to be repaid quickly and at high rates of reimbursement.To fund the project, member states would need to use an additional billion euros after they already agreed in December to top up the European Peace Facility by a further 2 billion euros, with a possibility of an additional 3.5 billion.In parallel, the European Defense Agency would aggregate demands from member states to restock, and lead a fast-track procedure for direct negotiations with industrial providers of ammunition in Europe.According to the official, a total of 12 companies in nine member states are producing 155mm ammunition. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, will incentivize them to ramp up production, with guarantees of long-term demand, making the project interesting for them, the official said.According to various estimates, Ukraine is firing 6,000-7,000 artillery shells daily, around a third of Russia’s total, one year into the war.The plan will be discussed by EU defense ministers next week before foreign and defense ministers further look at it during a meeting on March 20. Leaders could then rubberstamp it during a summit in Brussels on March 23-24."

The two have been allies since the Cold War-era and New Delhi depends on Moscow for nearly 60% of its defense equipment. India has increasingly scooped up Russian oil since the invasion a year ago, initially facing scrutiny from the U.S. and other allies over its growing purchases. That pressure has since waned and India has continued to abstain from voting in U.N. resolutions that condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine.Meloni is on her first visit to India after becoming Italy's prime minister in October last year.She said trade between the two countries had doubled in two years to more than $53 billion. Both sides called for expanding cooperation in defense, green energy, digital transition, cyber security and space.Primary Indian exports to Italy include ready-made garments, leather, iron ore, motor vehicles, textiles, chemicals, gems and jewelry. India mainly imports from Italy machinery, machine tools, metallurgical products and engineering items. Around 140 large Italian companies are active in India.Meloni conveyed to Modi her government’s desire to reboot defense ties with India. Modi said there were ample opportunities in defense manufacturing and co-production.He said the two countries will start joint military exercises and training courses for military personnel.Their military ties were damaged in 2014 after India canceled a $670 million contract for 12 helicopters after Italian defense giant Finmeccanica was accused of bribing Indian contacts to secure the deal.India had received three helicopters and stopped the delivery of the remaining nine AW1010 helicopters.India’s decision to prosecute two Italian marines in the shooting deaths of two Indian fishermen in 2012 sparked a bitter row between the two nations. India’s Supreme Court in 2021 closed criminal proceedings against the Italian marines after Italy paid $1.3 million in damages, ending the long-simmering case."

Over 65% of Democrats say the opposite, however, arguing that aid should continue for as long as it takes.Former President George W. Bush has pushed back on Republican criticism of Ukraine funding last week, arguing that the U.S. is wealthy enough to both support Ukraine and pursue its own priorities.Republicans like Georgia Rep.

However, the claim is unlikely to be true. Rather, the Ukrainian spy agency is more likely looking to dislodge Putin psychologically and cause him to chase phantoms and self-sabotage.While it is plausible that Ukrainians have infiltrated spies into the Russian government, those double agents are likely removed from Putin. It is extremely difficult to recruit an intelligence asset, a spy, who is close to Putin. His inner circle is very small, and its members are under heavy surveillance. Russia’s domestic counterintelligence agency, the FSB, employs a technical surveillance system SORM that intercepts phone calls, monitors text messages and emails, and tracks all internet communications of Russians who hold sensitive positions. Foreigners, especially U.S. and Western diplomats, intelligence officers and businessmen are also constantly monitored.Playing on Putin’s suspicious nature, Ukrainian intelligence probably wants the Russians to initiate a comprehensive security review of those close to the Russian strongman. This process would entail beefed up surveillance, interrogations, lie detectors and other security procedures. Such reviews drain resources, demoralize personnel, and shift the focus from an outside target, a foreign adversary, to an insider threat.With the war entering a second year with no end in sight, Putin is under enormous stress. Ukraine’s efforts to probe whether the Russian master spy is as indestructible, as he tries to portray himself, and sow suspicion in his inner circle, are entirely sensible. But it is not likely that a Ukrainian James Bond is roaming the Kremlin.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

Their actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common humanity,"" Harris said.Reinsalu reiterated the call for a tribunal to examine Russia’s ""crime of aggression,"" but he raised concerns that a ""crisis in the U.N."" has muddied its role and ability to properly help Ukraine since Russia holds a permanent seat on the Security Council.""That aggressor itself has a veto power over these decisions, and so the way to overcome it is truly by the General Assembly,"" Reinsalu said, explaining that he believes the General Assembly, with a mandate and cooperation with the secretary-general, can create the tribunal and bypass Russia’s veto power.But Reinsalu remains concerned that NATO allies are not doing enough to help Ukraine achieve victory.The U.S. on the one-year anniversary of the war announced an additional $2 billion in military aid to Ukraine in the form of laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammo and more, along with new sanctions on Russia’s economy.Reinsalu urged NATO allies to contribute more not just to the Ukraine defense but also to NATO itself as the alliance looks to expand. Finland and Sweden applied for membership due to concerns that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had irreparably shifted the international security landscape, but some existing members do not supply the necessary 2% of GDP to defense spending as stipulated.Estonia, which joined NATO in March 2004, has hit that mark since 2014, investing as much as 2.4% in 2020, though the number dropped to 2.2% in 2021, according to data from The World Bank.""We are making, before the Vilnius Summit, the call to that all the NATO allies should contribute their very fair share to defense, and the 2% is not enough … to raise the minimum of defense expenditure from GDP to 2.5% level,"" Reinsalu said, reiterating a stance revealed in early February."

The proposal does not say what would happen to the regions Russia has occupied since the invasion or give details on how the peace process should proceed, and has failed to gain much support.""The core of China's stance is to call for peace and encourage talks ... and for the legitimate security concerns of all countries to be respected,"" Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.Belarus ""fully agrees with and supports China’s position and proposals on a political solution to the Ukraine crisis, which is of great significance to resolving the crisis,"" CCTV quoted Lukashenko as saying.China has long had a close relationship with Lukashenko, and following their talks, the two leaders oversaw the signing of a raft of cooperation agreements in areas ranging from agriculture to customs enforcement and sports.However, the Belarussian leader's trip also illustrates the depth of Beijing’s ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his allies.China says it is a neutral party in the conflict and has maintained contacts with the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has cautiously welcomed Beijing’s involvement, but said success would depend on actions not words.Despite that, China says it has a ""no-limits friendship"" with Russia and has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion, or even to refer to it as such. It has accused the U.S. and NATO of provoking the conflict and of ""fanning the flames"" by providing Ukraine with defensive arms, while also condemning sanctions leveled against Russia and entities seen as aiding its military effort — including Chinese companies.China has maintained what it calls normal trade relations with Russia, and U.S. officials have warned recently that it is considering sending military assistance to Moscow, which is running increasingly short on ammunition and other war materiel. Beijing has called the U.S. allegations a smear campaign and said it is committed to promoting peace talks.Lukashenko’s government has strongly backed Moscow and allowed Belarus’ territory to be used as a staging ground for the initial invasion of Ukraine a year ago. Russia has maintained a contingent of troops and weapons in Belarus and the two neighbors and allies conducted joint military drills.This stance left Lukashenko even more isolated in Europe, where his country faces sanctions from the European Union over both its role in the war and his repression of domestic opposition.Lukashenko has been Belarus' only president since the position was created in 1994. He brutally suppressed 2020 protests over his disputed reelection in a vote that the opposition and Western countries regarded as fraudulent."

That's not surprising, given the intensity of the fight and the fact that they are clearly using what we are providing them and what our allies and partners are providing them to maximum effect.Noting that he isn't at liberty to discuss certain investigations into the matter, Storch said the Defense Department has ""not substantiated any such instances"" related to Clyde's question.""We're doing audits and evaluations that look at the weapons from the time they begin at the port, while they're transferred throughout as they get to the transhipment points, as they go into the country,"" Storch added.Last week, National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby told reporters in a White House briefing there is ""no indication"" that any of the billions of dollars in defense aid the U.S. has sent to Ukraine has been misplaced or stolen as GOP lawmakers push for an audit.""We have seen no indication to date that any of the resources or weapons we've provided to Ukraine have been misused, misplaced, stolen, sold on the black market or captured by the Russians,"" Kirby said at the time.A Fox News poll released last week found that half of American voters support sending aid to Ukraine for as long as it takes to win.The Biden administration on Friday announced several new actions in support of Ukraine's defense against Russia, including $2 billion in a new defense package, crushing economic sanctions on Russia's mining, tech and electronics sectors and financial institutions that support the nation's military supply chains and new limitations on exports to Russia and higher tariffs on imported Russian goods.Fox News' Chris Pandolfo contributed to this article.Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News.

The rate of response to its outreach is about 27% and its polls are conducted in person. Even if polls in Russia are not thought to be hugely accurate, given the fear factor, they are an important indicator of trends. The director of Levada, Denis Volkov, reflected on the high approval rating among Russians for the war in Ukraine—at 75%—giving a bit of context.""It’s important to understand,"" Volkov told Fox News, ""that there are several reasons for these high, high numbers of support. One is consolidation, the rally behind the flag effect. The other is that people don’t feel the war effects them and their lives directly."" It feels far away to many and that is exactly how President Vladimir Putin wants it.Volkov explained that Putin got a ratings boost from the war similar to the so-called ""Crimea Consensus"" that caused his popularity to rise similarly after he annexed Crimea in 2014. His ratings had over time made their way back down to about 66% just before the Feb. 24 invasion. Not only did they shoot back up into the 80s after he attacked Ukraine, but counter-intuitively, when you look at how the war is going, how little land has been captured and how many men have been killed, Levada polling shows a morale boost among Russians in the wake of the war.Levada’s polling shows Russians dislike the United States in equal measure to their like of Putin. That number has been high for some time. What I find surprising is the expressed Russian readiness to blame the West and specifically the United States for the war that Putin started.Volkov goes on to say that ""what we also see in our surveys that all conflicts Russia has taken part in over the past decades were understood as conflicts between Russia and the United States."" From Georgia to Syria. So blaming the West is nothing new. The stakes just feel much higher now.Volkov said that there is a difference between dislike towards the United States as a system, as feelings about American people and culture. And if older Russians are more skeptical, more pro-Putin and more anti-American, then young people are more positive. And that, he adds, scares the government as well as older generations.""They are fond of Western culture, American mass culture, music, and movies."" And they, Volkov said, are making the government and the older generations quite nervous because of this."
FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/america-republicans-divided-ukraine-than-we-thought,Howard Kurtz,2023-02-28T03:09:02-05:00,"America, especially Republicans, more divided over Ukraine than we thought","Some people favor staying as long as it takes, while others want a timeframe","There is one argument, in my view, that trumps everything when it comes to the U.S. doing whatever it takes to defend Ukraine.If the Ukrainians lose, Vladimir Putin will not only be rewarded for his bloody invasion and war crimes, but will try to gobble up other chunks of Europe, bringing him into direct conflict with NATO. And fighting what would be a much wider land war would be far more costly, by an order of magnitude, than what we are giving Volodymyr Zelenskyy to stop Moscow from rebuilding the Soviet empire.But I want to better understand the case from the other side. And I have to admit the media coverage is overwhelmingly in favor of providing Ukraine with better and more costly weapons, reflecting a consensus among pundits and the foreign policy establishment.In the latest Fox News poll, 66 percent of Democrats surveyed favor arming Ukraine for as long as it takes, the position that President Biden espoused last week when he showed up in Kyiv. But 61 percent of Republicans say America should limit the time frame for such support.That is a deeply divided country, and with House Republicans in charge, it’s not just empty rhetoric. What we do have is a substantial part of the population wondering whether Ukraine is becoming another unwinnable quagmire, along the lines of Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.In those wars, of course, there were American boots on the ground. Ukraine is, in effect, a proxy war where we provide money and weapons, but the people of that country do the fighting and suffer the casualties.It’s also true that economic sanctions have failed to cripple Russia, and that each time the Biden administration says it won’t provide more powerful offensive weapons, the president winds up green lighting them later on, losing precious time.Since the two leading GOP presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, ""favor talks and a peace settlement, along America First lines,"" it’s more likely that the U.S. and not Russia will pivot to a new policy.That does have a way of grabbing your attention. It’s why the U.S. stood by when the Soviets invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. It’s why Trump now regularly rips Biden for bringing us to the brink of World War III.The Russians, with 300,000 troops in Ukraine, have been exposed as having a weak and demoralized military, which is why Putin constantly shifts to bombing apartment buildings, hospitals and other civilian targets. Yet they can also drag out this war for years, at least along Ukraine’s eastern border."

She underscored the importance of fighting corruption, praising Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for enacting measures to ensure transparency in how the assistance is spent.The U.S. official also visited a renovated school that had its windows blown out by the blast wave from a Russian missile that landed nearby in March.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the treaty’s caps on nuclear weapons and continue notifying the U.S. about test launches of ballistic missiles.The inspections have been dormant since 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions on resuming them were supposed to have taken place last November, but Russia abruptly called them off.""We remain ready to work assertively with Russia to fully implement the New START treaty, continued implementation of the treaty based on the best interests of both parties,"" she said.Putin's announcement of suspending participation came just before the first anniversary of Russia sending troops into Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly cast the conflict as necessary to combat alleged Western aims to weaken Russia and has warned of an increasing threat of nuclear war.""Russia must end this war and must cease its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric,"" Jenkins said."

That visit was visibly awkward, given that Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s hard-line views on migration and Francis' call for countries to welcome those fleeing war, hardship and poverty.Since then, Hungary has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. Francis, who has repeatedly expressed solidarity with Ukraine, met at the Vatican with Orban last April and thanked him for taking them in.While Hungary accepted Ukrainian refugees, it has refused to provide weapons to Kyiv or allow their transfer across its borders, and has lobbied against European Union sanctions on Moscow and held up some financial aid packages to Ukraine.Francis has been supportive of Ukraine’s plight following Russia’s invasion -- likening it to a 1930s genocide of Ukrainians blamed on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin -- while Orban has been lukewarm in his support for Hungary’s eastern neighbor.Still, Orban has cast his view of the war as being in line with the Vatican’s, saying during a speech Feb. 18 that his government and the papacy were the only powers in Europe advocating for peace in Ukraine.Francis has also tried to maintain relations with Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church. Hungary was key in blocking the EU from sanctioning the head of the Russian church, Patriarch Kirill, over his support for the war.Francis will meet with refugees during his visit, as well as children. On his final day, he will deliver a speech to the Hungarian academic and cultural world, in which he is likely to issue a message to Europe at large.Francis, who just returned from Congo and South Sudan, has other trips confirmed or in the works this year. The 86-year-old pope, who marks his 10th anniversary as pontiff next month, is due to participate in World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal in August. He has said the Vatican is studying a possible trip to Mongolia at the end of September, after a brief stop in Marseille, France."

That’s up 7 points from 50% who felt that way last February. Those feeling hardest hit include Republican women (78% less money now), rural Whites (69%), Gen Xers (63%), and voters with annual income below $50,000 (62%).That’s how the economy remains the top issue, with 36% saying it’s the most important problem facing the country -- and it’s the number one choice among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. While that 36% is down from 42% in December, it still far outdistances the next highest priorities of immigration/border security (13%), climate (10%), and guns (9%).-- Biden receives best approval ratings yet on Ukraine, foreign policy.As the survey was underway, Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv (Feb. 20) and gave a major speech in Warsaw reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Ukraine (Feb. 21).His ratings are similar on national security (45-51%). Approval on foreign policy is up 2 points since October and stands at a high mark (43-52%). For reference, at around this same point in his administration, former President Donald Trump’s foreign policy rating was 38-53%. He never hit 50% approval on foreign policy.Currently, 44% approve and 55% disapprove of Biden’s overall job performance. That’s mostly unchanged over the last five months. About twice as many continue to strongly disapprove as strongly approve.-- Over half say the U.S. responded correctly to Chinese spy balloon.Biden’s underwater by only 3 points on his handling of the Chinese spy balloon (46-49%), and majorities think the U.S. government reacted appropriately by shooting down the balloon (54%) and the other flying objects (55%).At the same time, there’s widespread belief the government did a bad job communicating with the American people on these airborne activities (68%).

About five times as many Republicans as Democrats think the U.S. failed to react seriously enough.""We acted accordingly, and believe me, the message was clearly sent to China that this is unacceptable,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Feb. 19 on Fox News Sunday.More than 9 in 10 across the political spectrum agree China generally poses a threat to the U.S. However, far more Republicans (76%) than independents (67%) and Democrats (60%) describe it as a ""major"" threat.-- Views on Biden canceling student loan debt are mixed.The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Feb. 28 on challenges to Biden’s authority to cancel student debt. The poll finds 49% think Biden exceeded his authority under the Constitution by creating the program, while almost as many, 44%, say it was within his power.On the program itself, a majority supports canceling at least some college debt, as 25% say all of it should be forgiven and another 37% would cancel up to $20,000 for individuals with annual income of $125,000 or less. Thirty-six percent wouldn’t forgive any of it.Democrats would forgive at least some debt (87%) and say Biden acted within his authority (70%), while Republicans say none should be forgiven (61%) and the president overstepped his authority (79%). Independents say forgive some debt (62%), but also think Biden overstepped (54%).Voters with and without a college degree are equally likely to support canceling some debt, but more of those without a degree think Biden exceeded his authority creating the program.-- Low approval of White House handling of Feb. 3 Ohio toxic train derailment.Thirty-three percent approve, while 57% disapprove of how the administration is dealing with the aftermath of the Ohio train derailment. That’s driven by 82% of Republicans, 60% of independents, and 32% of Democrats disapproving. Regionally, disapproval mostly holds consistent, ranging from 54% in the Northeast to 58% in the Midwest where it happened to 59% in the South. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg first visited the area Feb. 23 and Environmental Protection Agency head Michael Regan was onsite Feb. 16.-- Most think Hunter Biden did something wrong.One voter in five (18%) think Hunter Biden didn’t do anything seriously wrong, while far more think he either did something unethical (36%) or downright illegal (37%). Most Republicans say he did something illegal (69%), while the largest number of Democrats (44%) and independents (43%) say unethical, but not illegal. Some 31% of Democrats say he didn’t do anything wrong."

Ukraine's war is a defensive battle against a powerful foe, while Afghanistan was a civil war.Ukraine's government in 2023 is better off than the government of a decade ago, which was mired in corruption in part due to pro-Kremlin and holdover Soviet interests.But how different it is from Afghanistan doesn't weigh into the need for oversight, Sopko said.The working group had dozens of reports planned for the coming year and certainly will add more. Already the IGs have identified a weakness, particularly in the Pentagon's security aid: There aren't enough U.S. personnel in Ukraine to track what's happening with the U.S. weapons and equipment sent there.""Congress and other Washington-based stakeholders should put their trust in the existing mechanisms in place and let them do their jobs,"" Hoffman wrote in an opinion column for The Hill this week.Calls from Congress to reduce or slow funding, Hoffman added, only help the Kremlin.Kirby's statement came one day after reports that Zelenskyy had fired government officials who had ""allegedly engaged in bribery, used government vehicles for personal use, and purchased inflated food supplies for Ukrainian forces,"" Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote in a letter to the Biden administration demanding more transparency.The call for oversight should be separate from the need for aid, according Sopko, but can't be ignored just because the goal is a noble one. Sopko looks to the example of Harry Truman, who, before running for president, made a name for himself in the Senate by investigating war profiteering in the early years of WWII — perhaps the ""most righteous war"" America has ever fought, Sopko said.""We must look and protect the taxpayers' money, no matter how good the cause,"" he said.Thomas Phippen is an Editor at Fox News."

However, he stressed that the U.S. continue sending military aid, including modern aircraft, to the war-torn nation.""There’s no scenario where Ukraine loses this battle,"" the two-time Academy Award winner said told Politico in an interview that was published on Friday.Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the ""Milk"" star took to Twitter to urge the U.S. and Polish governments to provide Ukraine with fighter jets.Poland had offered to give its entire fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. in exchange for a chance to buy American F-16s as part of a deal to bolster the Ukrainian air force while upgrading their own with NATO aircraft.However, the Pentagon announced later that it would not support Poland's proposal, referring to the move as ""high-risk"" for escalating tensions with Russia.The actor has since deleted his Twitter account.Penn has reiterated his calls for Ukraine to be supplied with more advanced aircraft during media interviews and in private conversations with members of Congress, Politico reported.The Biden administration has faced mounting pressure to provide Ukraine with modern fighter jets from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Last month, Biden told a White House reporter ""No"" when asked if he planned to send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets.""We went back to our hotel and closed our eyes for about two hours, and all of a sudden, the missiles and rockets were coming in,"" Penn remembered.The actor remained in Ukraine for a few days to continue filming after Russia's invasion. According to Politico, he has returned to the country six times, including a November visit when he gave his Oscar statuette to Zelenskyy. His most recent visit took place last week when he screened ""Superpower,"" which premiered on Feb. 17, for Zelenskyy.Penn told Politico that Zelenskyy was""clearly realistic"" about the likelihood that Russia would invade Ukraine during his first meeting with the president on Feb. 23.Fox News Digital's Lauryn Overhultz and Michael Ruiz contributed to this report."
FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-russia-invasion-ukraine,Tucker Carlson,2023-02-24T22:16:08-05:00,TUCKER CARLSON: Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the endpoint of a much longer story,Tucker claims the DNC's lies about Russian hacking paralyzed the Trump administration and expanded the national security state,"But, more significantly, the WikiLeaks scandal threatened to split the Democratic Party into pieces. More than 13 million Bernie Sanders voters, many of them young people, learned that the process they had always believed in, was in fact a sham. They had been cheated.Democratic leaders had to act quickly in the face of this, to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else. The DNC’s servers, they claimed, had been hacked by the Russian military. The goal was to hurt Hillary Clinton, whom the Russians feared for her strength and wisdom, and to help Donald Trump, whom they controlled. Russia hacked the servers, in order to hack the election. That was their story. The Washington Post ran with it the first day, as if it were true.But there was never any evidence that it was true. Almost seven years later, there is still no evidence. The DNC’s story about its servers is a lie. But, as a political strategy, that lie worked flawlessly. Russia made the perfect villain. It was a White, Christian country with a traditional social structure. It was everything the Democratic Party already opposed. The foreign policy apparatus in Washington was happy to hate Russia again. After 40 years of Cold War, hating Russia was muscle memory.So, soon the leaders of both parties in Washington signed on to the Russia collusion hoax. It had the twin benefits of paralyzing the Trump administration, which it did, and justifying the expansion of the national security state. As the years passed and the rhetoric intensified, hysteria set in. After awhile, anyone with a heterodox opinion — from right-wingers to avowed-socialists — could be accused of working secretly for Vladimir Putin. Many were accused, and some were destroyed by it. It was a textbook witch-hunt, far more effective than McCarthyism.And unlike McCarthyism, it never ended. Russia remained America’s greatest enemy, even as China emerged as America’s greatest threat. Over time, the lie that Democrats told to hide their crimes in the 2016 primaries, came to dominate America’s foreign policy, and then to imperil America itself. For generations, statesmen and diplomats worked to prevent other great powers from aligning as a block against the U.S. The idea was pretty straightforward: You might be able to beat one strong country, but if a couple of strong countries ever got together, you would lose. This is why Richard Nixon went to China: to make sure the Chinese government didn’t align with Brezhnev, with the Russians.Donald Trump understood this very clearly: ""Russia will never be our closest ally,"" he said. ""But if Russia ever becomes China’s ally, we’re in deep trouble."" The combination of natural resources, military and economic power — and sheer population — would make the Russian-Chinese alliance the most powerful force in the world. The United States would soon be dethroned, we’d be taking orders. As Trump put it, there is no reason to make Russia our enemy and there are many reasons not to.But the war we are fighting in Ukraine is not against Russia alone, but also against Russia’s newest ally, the People’s Republic of China. What Donald Trump predicted has happened, and in the worst way. If the war in Ukraine continues, we will lose no matter how it ends. The world order is being reshuffled as we watch, and by the time it’s over, the U.S. will no longer be at the top of the deck. That is very obvious to the rest of the world.PRESIDENT BIDEN 2022: The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity... This aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom... Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences. Today, I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions.Strong sanctions. That'll do it. Now, the goal at that point, a year ago today, you may remember this, was to push Russian forces back into their own country to reverse the invasion. And that seemed reasonable to most people. It did not seem like the beginning of a third world war, but it was exactly that. And by December, Lindsey Graham was confident enough to say so out loud. Here he is.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: How does this war end? When Russia breaks and they take Putin out. Anything short of that, the war is going to continue to ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. To signal a cease fire, Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again. So we're in it to win it and the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out.So what happens next in this war? Well, according to our elderly Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, the war in Ukraine will go on forever, and so will our support for Zelenskyy.SECRETARY YELLEN: Let me make clear, the United States and the allies, our support for Ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional.Unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this, how we plan to defeat Russia and its ally, China, and then build utopia. The piece is notably light on details. Now you'd feel a little better hearing all this if Tom Nichols and others like him in Washington had a track record that suggested they could do any of this, a track record of competence and success. They don't. Nichols himself seems to spend most of his life arguing with other people on Twitter. He's never achieved anything at all that we're aware of, but then virtually none of them have achieved anything. Biden's chief Ukraine strategist, Victoria Nuland – you would not hire her to plan spring break. She couldn't do it. She doesn't have the skills.But none of this ever occurs to people like Tom Nichols and Victoria Nuland and for that matter, Joe Biden. The more discredited they are, the more self-confident they become. They see every failure as evidence that their talents are more desperately needed than ever. What is this? Well, it's called hubris.Hubris has caused more suffering than polio. It's caused more deaths than smallpox, and apparently we're in the middle of another epidemic of it."

It has accused the West of provoking the conflict and ""fanning the flames"" by providing Ukraine with defensive arms.The plan released by China’s Foreign Ministry mainly reiterated long-held positions, and analysts said Beijing would be an unlikely broker.But some observers warned that Ukraine and its allies need to tread carefully, saying that rejection of what China sees as its peace overture could move Beijing closer toward providing arms to Russia instead.""As long as China comes up with peacemaker initiatives, it will be forced to maintain neutrality and to abstain from supplying weapons and direct military assistance to Russia,"" Fesenko told The Associated Press.Ukraine also might see ""a scenario in which China is at least pressuring Russia to contain the use of nuclear weapons and create a mechanism to control nuclear power plants in Ukraine,"" he said.For Beijing's part, it needed to clarify its stance, whether or not Kyiv and Moscow pay much heed, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Beijing’s Renmin University.""China feels it necessary to repeat its self-perceived neutrality at this juncture, to save some international influence by not only criticizing NATO but also distinguishing itself from Russia’s behavior,"" Shi said.China's proposal calls for the territorial integrity of all countries to be respected, but does not say what will happen to the regions Russia has occupied since the invasion. It also calls for an end to ""unilateral"" sanctions on Russia, indirectly criticizes the expansion of the NATO alliance, and condemns threats of nuclear force.Russia’s Foreign Ministry welcomed the proposal and said it shares China's ideas, including the rejection of Western sanctions. At the same time, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reaffirmed Moscow's demand for Ukraine to acknowledge Russia's land gains, renounce its bid to join NATO and assume a neutral status, among other conditions for peace.Ukraine has said it will not agree to any peace without the return of all its territory.China abstained Thursday when the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces.Its 12-point peace proposal also urges measures to prevent attacks on civilians, keep nuclear facilities safe, establish humanitarian corridors and ensure the export of grain. It called for an end to the ""Cold War mentality"" — China’s standard term for what it regards as U.S. hegemony and maintenance of alliances such as NATO.Zelenskyy said Friday that his main goal was making sure China doesn’t supply weapons to Russia. And he expressed hope that China’s involvement could be useful in isolating Russia. ""Our task is to gather everyone to isolate the one,"" he said.China's proposal comes as U.S.-China relations have hit a historic low over Taiwan, disputes over trade and technology, human rights, and China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea.Wang was responding to a report in the German magazine Der Spiegel that Russia’s military was negotiating with a small Chinese drone manufacturer for the ""components and know-how"" to allow the country to manufacture about 100 suicide drones a month."

He explained that most Russians are not particularly feeling the pinch. Despite expectations Russia’s economy would tank last year, growth was only down 3%, and the International Monetary Fund expects modest growth this year.Putin in his speech boasted minimum wages had gone up 20% in 2022 and would go up another 18% this year. Loans will be handed out like candy if his words are true.But Russia’s budget deficit is growing in recent months — ""whopping"" was the word Mironenko used in our conversation. But its reserves remain large to the tune of at least $120 billion and public debt is low, he says.But there are two sides to every kopek, and there are cracks in the edifice. Putin claims Russia’s relative economic success during trying circumstances is not down to printing money, but Mironenko says the treasury effectively is doing that while cleverly keeping it from flowing too quickly into the economy to further drive prices up.Sanctions, it seems, will take a bit more time to have a real and visible impact on Russia.""They didn’t destroy the Russian economy at once but have put it on a path of long and slow stagnation,"" Mironenko said. ""We have this figure of minus 3% growth in 2022, but the GDP was expected to rise by 3%."

The president, echoing the Pentagon’s stated goals to ""weaken"" Russia militarily and economically, affirmed his administration’s policy of ""squeezing Russia's economic lifelines"" through sanctions, threatening to ramp up the already ""unprecedented costs"" on Moscow.Putin is aware that Ukraine fatigue is setting in the U.S. Support among the public and politicians, especially some Republicans, for funding and arming Ukraine is not as strong as it once was. He also knows about the Pentagon’s concerns about the depletion of U.S. weapons stockpiles, as result of significant outflows of weaponry to Ukraine, as China is becoming more belligerent with regard to Taiwan. These factors give Putin confidence that Russia could outlast Ukraine as his forces continue to exterminate Ukrainians and obliterate Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, industrial base and agricultural foundation.Putin’s move to potentially dismantle the entire nuclear arms control regime on which the world has relied for decades for strategic stability is viewed by Western analysts as disproportionately escalatory. Washington hopes to contain the conflict in Ukraine, but Putin’s regime does not see this as limited. Loss of war in Ukraine is unthinkable for Putin as it would mean NATO, an adversarial alliance, will end up in a hostile nation on Russia’s doorstep.Putin believes that he faces a potential choice, if he cannot win the war of attrition, of either letting NATO bleed out Russia militarily and economically or using the nuclear card to flip the battlefield dynamics, stop the bleeding and prevent NATO’s expansion into what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter. The risk of Putin using his nuclear card in Ukraine will increase as the conflict goes on and Moscow and Washington are climbing the escalation ladder. Expecting Putin to let Western arms flows hemorrhage Russia out is not rational.Putin does not want to use his nuclear card and Russia will almost certainly not launch a nuclear strike on the U.S. homeland, outside a direct U.S.-Russia military conflict. However, Russian military doctrine does envision tactical nuclear employment on the battlefield to halt an escalating conflict. The strategic disconnect between Moscow and Washington is that what Russia views as de-escalatory and defensive, NATO views as strategic escalation. Russian and U.S. leaders must understand, and soon, that their contradictory views and proxy war over Ukraine may well lead to a catastrophic outcome.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

""And you know better than anyone what's at stake in this conflict, not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world.While Ukraine has contributed to NATO operations and missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, this is not enough to warrant the full protection of all NATO nations.While NATO has pledged to back Ukraine with defensive aid to win the war against Russia, it has stopped short of sending in boots on the ground – a stipulation only afforded to the 30-member nations.Though the NATO charter stipulates that no nation can be fully considered or accepted as a member while it is engaged in conflict.""We are not alone in this endeavor,"" he added.Security officials are greatly concerned by the threat China's participation in the war would bring as it would not only change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine but would force European nations to cut economic ties and further strain relations between China and the West.This geopolitical divide between democracies and autocracies would create its own challenges, particularly as it relates to security concerns over Taiwan.""We must break the cycle of Russian aggression,"" Stoltenberg warned.

It was a time of mixed messages. The U.S. was declaring, including in a backgrounder we got at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, that Moscow was going to attack. Various expert analysts told us the same thing. Right to the brink though, including at a press conference we were at, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was being cagey. He’d later say he didn’t want to spook the public.Shortly after that, I would get my own chilling news. My dear father, at the grand age of 108, had passed away. This cut short my trip to Ukraine in order to get back to New York for his funeral. Maybe appropriate, though, that this happened in the midst of news-gathering. Dad long ago instilled in me a passion for current events. When I went to the den in his home, I found the latest issue of the Economist magazine open to a story about Ukraine.Which brings me to Feb 24, 2022. No, I wasn’t on the frontline of the invasion. I was in my pajamas in the dining room of our home in London in the early hours of the morning. I was getting the latest on every amazing detail of Vladimir Putin’s attack via a What’sApp group we had started in Kyiv earlier. Most important were the messages from our local producer 24 year-old Sasha Kuvshynova. I passed them on to Fox News via a mass email group. In those early confusing days Sasha was an invaluable source of information for the network and our viewers.On the way back to Lviv, I rang my dear friend and cameraman through thick and thin for the last 20y years, Pierre Zakrzewski. He was in Kyiv working with correspondents and friends Benjamin Hall and Trey Yingst, covering the incursions by Russian forces into the suburbs of the capital. They were reporting on the first waves of death, destruction and terror heaped on the Ukrainian people by Moscow. Pierre, as always, was deep in the mix. It would be the last time we’d speak.My sign offs during the lives that night were essentially…Sad time for Ukraine…and a sad day for Fox News. At a proper Irish funeral in Dublin for Pierre the following week…we would lift several glasses. For those we lost. And the country that was under attack.And yes, the battle did go on. Remarkably, the Ukrainians were fighting back with clever tactics and daring deeds. Crucially pushing the Russian troops back and away from the outskirts of Kyiv and driving them across the border as Putin’s ill-planned push to topple the Ukrainian leadership stumbled.We went to Bucha, one of the hardest-hit towns by Russian fighters and saw….a long smoothed-over patch of dirt next to the main church where bodies had been buried in a mass grave. We visited a long residential street…eerily still that day…a shooting gallery for Russian mercenaries a few weeks back. And spoke with residents still breaking down in tears over the horror heaped on them.And we went to Borodyanka. Made infamous for a long apartment building. With the middle gashed out of it by Russian shelling…a statue to a Ukrainian poet with a bullet through its tin head…shops with their fronts knocked out. In many cases, we were told it was brave locals who stood up and fended off a first wave of Russian attacks. Only to get battered by nasty revenge attacks days later.Throughout these trips we spoke with a lot of folks. Some innocents caught in the fire. Some helping to lead this young brave democracy. People like 26-year-old Sviat Yurash. He was our local producer during the early protests and Russian attacks in 2014. He would become the youngest member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became famous as images of his lanky frame walking patrols around Kyiv, a long gun slung over his shoulder spread around the world.Still the war went on. Offensives and counter-offensives. By the time we returned in October and November, Kyiv had gained back more ground, but Moscow had a new tactic. It couldn’t win on the battlefield, so it would strike civilians. Or at least the infrastructure supporting regular folks. Power stations, power lines, water pumping stations, phone and internet relay stations.That became the weekly drill. Air raid sirens. A distant or not so distant rumble. Then emergency teams racing to a site. Which we raced to. To record the damage. And hear from people recounting projectiles falling around them. And then being left without vital essentials. A one-two Putin punch.A cemetery we visited in the heart of Kyiv also told the tale. Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war. We spoke with a mother who lost her son. A couple who lost a friend. Two others who were missing a colleague. Young and old. Black and white family photos. Teddy bears. Football scarves. Bits of life. Turned to death.Also always on our minds, the loss of Pierre and Sasha. We stopped a few times during our reporting to see the exact spot where Russian missiles stole their lives. All that’s left…some ugly divots and spray marks from shrapnel on the side of the road. Flowers and memorial cards left. What was positive, though, the remarkable recovery of Benjamin Hall from terrible wounds. We had a warm reunion upon our return from the latest trip.And so back to this first anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. And what lies ahead. Frankly, not even us grizzled war correspondents know for sure. What seems likely is that Vladimir Putin will not give up. He has set himself on a road to a brutal take-over and until he comes close to achieving something, he’ll continue to throw his cannon fodder into the ugly mix.So far, the U.S. and international allies don’t look like they’re giving up either. Most countries seem willing to up the ante. Though there are worrying signs, including in the U.S., of flagging enthusiasm.Greg Palkot currently serves as a London-based senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

What’s next?",Ukraine says it's fighting a 'smart war' to prioritize military capabilities over sheer brute force,"One year ago today Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Europe entered into a security crisis not seen since World War II and Black Sea blockades created global shock waves that prompted worldwide food shortages.But instead, the world watched as the real time David vs. Goliath story unfolded and Ukrainian troops held strong against one of the largest, most sophisticated militaries in the world – stopping Putin in his tracks.Basic logistical failures like fuel shortages stalled Russian efforts within the first week of the invasion, showing a level of unpreparedness in Moscow’s ranks that flabbergasted Western defense officials.""It is a relentless attrition of manpower,"" Koffler said. ""And he's clearly preparing for a very, very protracted battle.Defense officials and Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines have reported that the constant supply of Russian troops funneled into Ukraine are inadequately supplied, lack sufficient training and are being killed at increasing rates.In mid-February a BBC Russia investigation found that in the confirmed deaths of over 1,000 conscripted men mobilized after Putin’s September order, 40% of them were killed after the 2023 New Year – signaling a spike in frontline deaths.Kyiv has estimated that Russian forces have lost up to 1,000 men a day in the Bakhmut sector alone.It is now believed that Russia's offensive charge will come in waves closer to the spring time when the weather lets up and will likely not be one united push.""It's a war in which tactics and equipment and the smart use of modern technologies are a decisive factor, not the sheer number of armed forces,"" Sak explained, pointing to how the battlefield dynamic in Ukraine shifted once Kyiv had received High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) last summer.""That was a turning point,"" he said. ""We were able to reach the enemy – ammunition depots and command centers – deeper inside their territory.""It's always important to try to be one step ahead of the enemy, not one step behind,"" Sak added.Hoffman argued the West’s hesitancy and repeated decision reversals to send adequate aid to Ukraine is what has prolonged this war to begin with.Koffler argued that Putin’s true aim is in blocking Ukraine from being accepted into NATO, and so long as the nation is embroiled in a war it will not be eligible to join the military alliance.The Ukrainian defense adviser said that ultimately Ukraine will keep doing what it must in the continued face of Russian aggression – fight.Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news."

""Colleagues, this vote will go down in history.""On the one-year anniversary of this conflict, we will see where the nations of the world stand on the matter of peace in Ukraine,"" she added.Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and the yearlong war has involved countries from around the world collectively contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to provide weapons and equipment to Ukraine’s military. Many of the funds have been provided for humanitarian reasons and to repair the country’s infrastructure.According to Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. stands united with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in keeping Ukrainian territories out of the hands of Russia’s rule.Biden also announced during his surprise trip that the U.S. will be providing nearly $500 million in additional security assistance to Ukraine.The president’s visit commitment comes just days before the war reaches its one-year milestone, well longer than experts initially predicted the war would last.Thomas-Greenfield said Russia lied to the international community in the days leading up to the invasion and claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin continue to do so amid global calls for peace.""That cold February night, one year ago today, I asked Russia to stop. To return to its borders. To send its troops, tanks, and planes back into their barracks and hangars. To send diplomats back to the negotiating table. But it was too late. At that exact moment I joined so many others in the Security Council and around the world in making a plea for peace. President Putin chose war. This was an illegal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine. But it was also an assault on the United Nations. It struck at the very heart of the UN Charter,"" the ambassador said.The ambassador visited Ukraine last year and said seeing the impacts of the war and the suffering and resolve of the Ukrainian people was an emphatic experience. She also said she learned ""the most powerful lessons"" as she met with refugees and victims, including a 10-year-old girl named Milena.""But it was in the faces of Ukrainian children that I found hope. I met a 10-year-old girl, Milena, who lived in a facility where displaced families were gathering to prepare for the cold winter. A facility that had once been hit by Russian missiles. And I asked Milena what she wanted to do when the war was over. And she smiled. She told me, simply, that she wanted to go back to school and see her best friend again. Her face beamed with hope. I will never forget her shining eyes,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.The day after her remarks, the U.N. overwhelmingly voted to demand Russia ""immediately"" and ""unconditionally"" withdraw its forces from Ukraine.Thursday's resolution also called for a ""just and lasting"" peace.Belarus, North Korea, Syria, Eritrea, Mali and Nicaragua joined Russia in opposition.The resolution does not force Russia to leave Ukraine.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the vote a victory.Fox News' Andrea Vacchiano contributed to this report."

It's sad, really.Unfortunately, what happens to men also tends to happen to the systems they create. For the last 80 years, our world has been governed by a system formed in the final months of World War II. Its features define our life: free and open global trade routes guaranteed by the U.S. Navy, a universal currency called the dollar and overseeing it all, one supreme power, the world's largest economy, the United States of America.We're going to tell them what the rules are. Once they hear the rules, they'll obey. Janet Yellen seems shocked and outraged that China has decided to align with Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine. It's an outrage. It's unbelievable.

The White House stated at the time that Biden had given Putin a pair of Aviators sunglasses, but it did not disclose Putin's lavish gift to the president.State Department records say the gift was given to the National Archives for safekeeping, a common destination for presidential gifts. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital regarding why it hadn't previously disclosed Putin's gift.The State Department release, first reported by Bloomberg News, describes the gift as a ""Kholuy lacquer miniature workshop desk writing set and pen"" and listed an estimated value of $12,000. Meanwhile, Biden's glasses had a value of a few hundred dollars.The June 2021 summit came just eight months before Putin would invade Ukraine, dashing hopes of improved relations between the U.S. and Russia.The pen set will likely end up in Biden's presidential library after he leaves office. Gifts granted to U.S. presidents are considered to be the property of the U.S. government, not the individual office-holder. Officials must purchase the items for the estimated price in order to own and use them after leaving office.Gift-giving among world leaders is an extremely common practice, but Putin's writing set was by far the most expensive gift listed in the State Department's disclosure. For instance, French President Emmanuel Macron also gave Biden a pen, but it was worth just $430.

Those meetings showed the strengthening of Russia's relationship with China and raised concern in the West that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support for its war in Ukraine.Russia's aims for the naval exercises came under scrutiny because of the involvement of the Admiral Gorshkov, a frigate which is armed with hypersonic missiles and has served as the main testbed for them. The ship arrived in Cape Town last week emblazoned with the letters Z and V, letters also seen on Russian weapons on the front lines in Ukraine and which are used as patriotic symbols in Russia.Russia has said the Zircon missiles can penetrate any missile defense systems by flying at an astounding 7,000 miles per hour  — around nine times the speed of sound — to strike targets at sea and on land. They have a range of over 620 miles, Russia claims.Putin sent the Admiral Gorshkov on a trans-ocean cruise last month in a show of force as tensions with the West escalated over Ukraine. But a Russian navy officer in South Africa said Wednesday that the exercises would focus on maritime security, including the fight against piracy, and the Zircons would not be fired.The drills will involve ""mutual maneuvering of the three sides, assistance of the suffering vessel in a disaster, liberation of a captured vessel by the pirates, and artillery fire which, according to our schedule, does not include the firing with the hypersonic missiles,"" Capt. Oleg Gladkiy said. He spoke through a translator.The Admiral Gorshkov and a Russian oil tanker for refueling, a Chinese destroyer, frigate and a support vessel, and a South African frigate will be involved in the exercises, according to a South African military statement released last week.Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa, Liubov Abravitova., criticized the timing of the drills, which will overlap with Friday's one-year anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine.""The vessel that came to the shores of South Africa basically brought a piece of the war to this peaceful land through having the letters Z and V, which they are using as a marking on their military equipment while bombing Ukrainian cities,"" Abravitova said in an interview with The Associated Press.Last week, a small yacht flying Ukraine’s flag sailed by the Admiral Gorshkov in Cape Town’s harbor in protest. On Wednesday, a group of protesters gathered outside the Russian Embassy in the South African capital, Pretoria. They criticized the presence of the Russian warship and South Africa's decision to host it.South Africa, a key partner of the West in Africa, has come under criticism for holding the naval exercises but has defended itself by saying they were planned two years ago, well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The exercises are to be held around the Indian Ocean port cities of Durban and Richards Bay.

The sides split amid a civil war in 1949.The Pentagon did not comment directly on Chase's visit but repeated its ""commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,"" the Associated Press reported.Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also did not address the visit.""We urge the U.S. to ... stop any form of official U.S.-Taiwan contacts, stop meddling in the Taiwan issue and stop creating new factors of tension in the Taiwan Strait,"" Wang said Wednesday.Tensions between the U.S. and China remain unsteady as Washington accused Beijing of using a balloon that carried surveillance capabilities that soared over the continental U.S. before it was shot down off the coast of South Carolina.Immediately following the spy balloon controversy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to Beijing and the U.S. continues to criticize communication between China and Russia over the latter’s invasion of Ukraine.China, in response, said it has ""no limits"" in its friendship with Russia and instead blames the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin.A delegation of U.S. lawmakers — including Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, Jake Auchincloss, D-MA, and Jonathan Jackson, D-Illin. — visited Taiwan earlier this week as part of their five-day visit.On Monday, the delegation met with the head of the legislature and the following day they met with President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials.The congressional team also met with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s founder Morris Chang, considered the father of the island’s world-leading microchip industry that is now investing heavily in U.S. production."

""They want Russia to win. On the other hand, they don’t want to lose their economic access to Europe.""It’s impossible to know where they’ll come down,"" he added.The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news."

Viktor's team, which belongs to the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, believes he bore the brunt of the hit, helping ensure Serhiy walked away with only a broken arm.Adrenaline helps keep the medical team going and enables them to cope with the almost constant flow of wounded soldiers, including some Russians who are later exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners.""This is our job,"" said Viktor from inside their outpost, which is festooned with Ukrainian flags and drawings and thank-you notes from children across the country."

While the visit received mixed reactions online, Beschloss celebrated Biden while appearing on MSNBC’s ""The ReidOut,"" likening him to Lincoln during the Civil War.""Yeah, I think what Biden did today goes straight through two centuries of proud American history. Just what you said earlier, Joy. Presidents – let’s say LBJ and Nixon used to go to Vietnam, but they would appear on an American air base that was pretty well controlled. To find a day of this kind of presidential bravery in a war zone, you have to go back to 1864, July, when Abraham Lincoln as president went to see confederate soldiers who were firing on Washington, D.C. on the brink of taking it over,"" Beschloss said.Although Beschloss and host Joy Reid singled out Biden as being uniquely brave for his trip, surprise visits to war-torn nations have regularly occurred in the modern age. President George W. Bush famously visited Iraq eight months after the war began in 2003.""It goes back to one other thing. George Washington in 1754, before he was president, long before, was in the French and Indian War of all things and he was in danger of being killed himself. He wrote to his brother, the bullets whistled past me, and I found something charming in the sound,"" he continued.""That’s what presidential bravery in wartime is. Joe Biden goes all the way back to that,"" Beschloss insisted.While Biden’s visit was not the first time a president traveled to a war zone, his appearance marked the first time a president visited a war zone that did not involve U.S. soldiers.During his visit, Biden also pledged nearly $500 million in additional security including additional rocket system ammunition, mortar and artillery rounds, radar equipment, anti-armor weaponry, four Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two tactical vehicles for equipment recovery, Claymore anti-personnel mines, demolition munitions, night-vision equipment, communications equipment, medical supplies, spare parts and other field equipment.Fox News' Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report.Lindsay Kornick is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

He arrived around 4:00 a.m. ET and the plane departed at 4:15 a.m. ET.The plane stopped to refuel at Ramstein Air Base in Germany at 5:13 p.m. local time on Sunday after an approximately seven-hour flight, before continuing on to Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport in Poland. During its roughly one hour and 15 minutes on the ground, the plane's shades remained drawn.It landed in Rzeszów, Poland at 7:57 p.m. local time. The airport was clear at the time of Biden's arrival, and the press pool was quickly ushered to a designated SUV as part of a motorcade estimated to contain approximately 20 cars.The motorcade began rolling at 8:12 p.m. local time and began a roughly one-hour long journey on a family empty highway to Przemyśl Główny train station. No sirens were used during the drive to avoid drawing attention.It arrived at the near empty Przemyśl Główny train station at approximately 9:15 p.m. local time, where Biden was dropped directly in front of his train car at the already waiting train. It contained approximately eight cars, according to a security officer on the train, and had a heavy security presence.The train departed the station at 9:37 p.m. local time. According to an agent on the train, it crossed into Ukraine at roughly 10:00 p.m. local time. Much of the journey took place in the dark and lasted roughly 10 hours, while stopping a handful of times for unclear reasons except to pick up additional security on at least one occasion.The sun had risen by the time the train approached Kyiv and came to a stop at the Kyiv-Pasazhyrsky station at roughly 8:00 a.m. local time. The area around the platform had been cleared and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink awaited Biden and his staff at the station.Biden reportedly said ""it's good to be back in Kyiv"" when he stepped off the train.Biden departed the train at 8:07 a.m. local time and entered another motorcade that departed the station at 8:18 a.m. local time en route to Mariinsky Palace where Biden was greeted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Fox News' Erin McEwan contributed to this report.Brandon Gillespie is an associate editor at Fox News.

Russia also has maintained about 10,000 troops in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.Speaking during a meeting with officials Monday, Lukashenko said the country needs to form paramilitary units in every town or village to serve as territorial defense to complement the country's 45,000 military ""in case of aggression."" He added that every Belarusian man must learn how to handle weapons ""to protect his family and home"" if needed.Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said Belarus will form a force of up to 150,000 volunteers who will be given weapons but keep their civilian jobs. He noted that its members will form a military reserve in peacetime and could act as guerrillas in case of war.While hailing the importance of defense cooperation with Russia and expressing support for the Kremlin’s action in Ukraine, Lukashenko has emphasized that he will only send Belarusian troops into Ukraine if his country is attacked.The Kremlin has staunchly backed Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for nearly three decades, helping him weather months of massive protests triggered by his re-election in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged."

Bush traveled to Iraq in 2003.As the war in Iraq ramped up eight months after U.S. troops invaded, Air Force One landed in Baghdad over the Thanksgiving weekend under a false call sign.Bush would go on to hold several secret visits to war zones during his presidency, including three others to Iraq and two to Afghanistan in 2006 and 2008.Donald Trump, who faced some criticism for waiting almost two years before he visited U.S. troops in a combat zone, also slipped in two unannounced visits during his presidency, including to Iraq in late 2018 and Afghanistan in 2019.Dwight Eisenhower visited and ate with U.S. troops in Korea during the Korean War in December 1952.Lyndon Johnson met with troops in a South Vietnam combat zone in Cam Ranh Bay in 1966.

The U.S. Treasury has already expressed concerns about the amount of Russian cash flowing into the Arabian Peninsula country.The arms fair typically sees the Emiratis host individuals that could be seen as problematic in the West. Former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir came to the 2017 edition. Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov, himself now deeply involved in the Ukraine war, came in both 2019 and 2021.This year's event drew Libya's Khalifa Hifter, the commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army who faces a U.S. lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating indiscriminate attacks on civilians and torturing and killing political opponents.But while not directly acknowledged at this year's show, the tendrils of Russia's war on Ukraine could be seen everywhere at the fair Monday.To reach Russia's exhibition tent, those attending the fair had to leave Abu Dhabi's cavernous National Exhibition Center and cross along a skybridge to an outdoor area.Russian officials delayed Associated Press journalists from going inside their tent as an event was going on, initially without explanation. About an hour later, AP journalists saw Denis Manturov, Russia's minister of trade and industry, come out of the tent.Manturov is sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, with London describing him as being ""responsible for overseeing the Russian weapons industry and responsible for equipping mobilized troops"" in the war on Ukraine. Yet Manturov described the ongoing war as providing advertising for Russian weaponry.Emirati officials did not directly acknowledge Manturov's presence. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment about Russia's presence at the arms show in a country that hosts thousands of American troops. Manturov visited the Emirates as U.S. President Joe Biden was in Kyiv, Ukraine.Inside the Russian tent, a video screen proclaimed the power of Moscow's surface-to-air missile systems, like those now being used to strike cities in Ukraine. Salesmen showed off Kalashnikov assault rifles to Emirati troops. Other model missiles sat on display.Just outside of the tent, Russian Helicopters displayed several of its civilian aircraft, flanked by attractive young women in silver flight caps.UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was not seen at the opening, which was attended by his brother, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. However, one Russian magazine at the arms fair printed an English edition that carried photos of Sheikh Mohammed smiling and shaking Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand during an earlier visit to Moscow.In contrast, a giant armed drone by Baykar was parked next to the Russian tent. The Turkish drone company's Bayraktar drones have played such a key role in Kyiv campaign against Russia there's even a song in Ukrainian about the aircraft.A short walk away, U.S. Army troops showed off a model of a Javelin anti-tank missile, allowing the curious to fire it in a computer simulation.U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Evan Williams of the 2-116th Cavalry Regiment said he and his soldiers had talked to Russian visitors at the fair and others curious about the weapon, which Ukraine has used to deadly effect against Russian armored vehicles.The U.S. Army also had a Patriot missile battery on display at the fair. American forces used the battery in combat for the first time in decades in 2022 to help defend Abu Dhabi against an attack by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Meanwhile, Israel as well had its first full contingent of weapons companies on display, for the first time since the UAE diplomatically recognized the country in 2020. Both Israel and the UAE's leadership have a deep suspicion about Iran's intentions, though the UAE has tried to deescalate with Tehran, which now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.Israeli-Emirati ties have warmed even as Israel continues to build settlements on land the Palestinians want for their future state and as more Israeli-Palestinian violence spikes."

The pair have previously embarrassed European politicians including French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish President Andrzej Duda and then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as Elton John and Prince Harry, with similar hoax calls.The recording features Merkel saying — as she has done publicly before — that the much-criticized Minsk peace agreement had bought precious time for Ukraine.

They are all jam-packed with big-spending, Kremlin-connected Russians enjoying legal impunity and living like the gods they think they are. I suspect that nearly every $25,000-a-night hotel room in the world is occupied by a Russian.Until this changes, these powerful oligarchs will continue to support Putin’s bloody war. They currently aren’t paying any price. Thus, targeting and seizing the wealth of Putin’s many collaborators is an essential part of any real strategy to end his disastrous invasion of Ukraine.Second, expand the list of Russians who are subject to sanctions. The current list only scratches the surface of those who are supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Finally, the West must deny Russian oligarchs the safe harbors around the world where they reside, vacation and invest their ill-gotten wealth. If they want to support Putin, let them sit in Moscow with him.That kind of crackdown on the Kremlin’s oligarchs will have long-term benefits for the future security of Europe. And for Russia. Putin won’t be in power forever. But whoever comes next will find themselves surrounded by an intelligence service, military, mercenary industry, and economic elites deeply invested in corruption, organized crime and violent nationalism. Unless Europe and the U.S. decide that enough is enough.The best way to break the current deadly stalemate reminiscent of the trenches in World War I is to try a new approach. Show Putin’s vast army of enablers that their lifestyles and wealth aren’t safe as long as Russia continues to wage war against innocent Ukrainian civilians.Amed Khan is a direct action philanthropist.

We are committed to helping Ukraine. Not because of vague moral arguments or abstractions like the so-called ‘rules-based international order.’ But rather, because America’s own core national interests are at stake. Because our security is interlinked, and our economies are intertwined.The U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort since the Russian invasion a year ago, giving more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. That includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.In January, the U.S. announced additional security assistance, including approval by President Biden of 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine.But there have been indicators of growing hesitancy among some Republicans. McCarthy said in November that Republicans wouldn’t write a ""blank check"" for Ukraine. A relatively small but vocal group in the House has opposed the continued aid and called for it to stop.There have also been dissenting voices in the Senate. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., expressed concern this week that pouring support into Ukraine will hurt America's ability to defend against aggression from China.Meanwhile, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published this week showed that 48% of those polled support providing weapons to Ukraine, down from 60% in May 2022.""If you want to help Ukraine win; if you want NATO to emerge stronger from this conflict; and if you want sustained political support in America for our staying engaged and invested in maintaining a Europe that is whole, free  and at peace . . . then America’s friends on this continent must mirror the resolve and reciprocate the commitment that you hope to see from us,"" he said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.He can be reached at adam.shaw2@fox.com or on Twitter."

I think there’s still a little bit to be worked out, but certainly, the tanks being built here in Lima are central,"" she said.An Associated Press reporter was allowed to accompany Wormuth on the tour, the first journalist to walk the production lines since the U.S. pledged Abrams tanks to Ukraine.U.S. officials have declined to provide details about the Abrams that will eventually go to Ukraine, saying they have to decide whether to send refurbished older Army tanks, Marine tanks or some other version. But in most cases, the tanks would need upgrades at the Lima plant before being shipped to Ukraine’s battlefront.""Part of it is figuring out — among the different options — what's the best one that can allow us to get the Ukrainians tanks in as timely a fashion as we can,"" without disrupting foreign military sales, Wormuth said.Officials said Thursday that production totals at the plant — which is formally called Joint Systems Manufacturing Center-Lima — vary, based on contract demands. And while the plant is currently building 15-20 armored vehicles per month — including tanks — it can easily boost that to 33 a month and could add another shift of workers and build even more if needed.Wormuth said the timeline on sending Abrams to Ukraine depends on whether the U.S. takes tanks from existing American military training stocks or from Army units, which would be less desirable because it could affect their readiness to fight. And the development of tanks for Ukraine would also have to be squeezed in between the current contracts for foreign sales, which include 250 of the newest versions for Poland and about 75 for Australia.In a dramatic reversal, the Biden administration announced in January that it will send 31 M1A2 Abrams tanks to Ukraine — after insisting for months that the 70-ton battle powerhouses were too complicated and too hard to maintain and repair. The decision was part of a broader political maneuver that opened the door for Germany to announce it would send its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and allow Poland and other allies to do the same.Ukrainian leaders have pressed for the Abrams, which first deployed to war in 1991 and has thick armor, a 120 mm main gun, armor-piercing capabilities and advanced targeting systems. It runs on thick tracked wheels and has a 1,500-horsepower turbine engine with a top speed of about 42 miles per hour.As she walked the production lanes in the 25-acre building, Wormuth got to see the newest version of the Abrams as it transformed from an empty steel hull into a shiny, newly painted tank — a process that takes 18 to 24 months. The U.S. doesn't build new tanks from scratch. It has a fleet of about 2,500 Abrams, and takes older tanks, tears them down and and uses the empty hull as a starting point to build a new one. Some hulls have been refurbished multiple times.Across the aisle from one empty hull, sparks flew as a worker welded pieces of the tank together. In another section, a worker showed where they will install a new auxiliary engine in the latest version, which will run on diesel when needed to save on the large amount of jet engine fuel the tank consumes. And, farther down the lane, workers had laid out the two rows of tracks the Abrams runs on, preparing to install them on one of the tank bodies. The tracks stretch out more than 60 feet (18 meters) and weigh two tons on each side.Roughly 800 people work at the plant, which is spread across 369 acres in northwest Ohio. Its 1.6 million square feet of manufacturing space is the only place where the M1A2 Abrams is made. About 45% of the workers are focused on the tank, but the plant also churns out Stryker armored vehicles, tank support vehicles and some other equipment.As Wormuth wrapped up her visit with a look at some of the finished tanks in another building, a long line of the newest Abrams sat outside on nearby train tracks. And as she was preparing to leave, the train cars began to move, taking the tanks on to Fort Hood, Texas, where they'll get their radios and other equipment before going to their final destination with an Army unit.Speaking to reporters afterward, Wormuth said the Army will invest about $558 million into improvements at the plant over the next 15 years. Some of those include expanded use of robotics."

He also reiterated an Israeli offer to help Ukraine develop a ""smart early-warning"" air raid system.But he gave no specifics on when that system might be delivered, made no mention of Russia and did not appear to respond to Ukrainian appeals for Israel to provide offensive weaponry.""Israel, as stated in the past, stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and remains committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Cohen said.The visit came just before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion and as Western nations seek to increase aid to the country.Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has walked a tightrope between assisting Ukraine and avoiding friction with Russia, with which it has strategic regional interests. Unlike other western countries, Israel has not imposed sanctions on Russia or Russian officials or provided Ukraine with weapons.It has provided humanitarian support to Ukraine, including a field hospital, and pledged to provide the aerial-warning system. Ukrainian leaders have talked about some intelligence cooperation with Israel, but Israeli officials have not publicly confirmed these ties or the extent of any such cooperation.""During our detailed and frank talks, we focused on ways to enhance bilateral relations, increase assistance, and address shared security challenges,"" he said.Cohen later was meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of the country’s Jewish community as part of the brief trip.Cohen was reminded of the hardships endured by Ukrainians when air raid sirens sounded as he entered the country’s Foreign Ministry.Cohen said earlier this year that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government ""will definitely do one thing: publicly, we will talk less"" about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but would keep providing Ukraine with humanitarian aid. Shortly after taking office, he spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Israel maintains good working relations with both warring countries, and has large populations of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. Israel also relies on security coordination with Russia over neighboring Syria, where Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian military positions in the past decade. Russian warplanes also operate in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and Russia and Israel maintain communication to avoid conflict.As other Western nations step up assistance to Ukraine, pressure has built on Israel to share some of its sophisticated military means with Ukraine, including from the U.S.Yossi Shain, a former member of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee, said Israel’s ultranationalist government — which has butted heads with the Biden administration on the issue of West Bank settlements — may try to gain Washington’s favor by providing defensive capabilities to Ukraine, while ""not crossing certain lines that will endanger its lesser involvement because of the threats of Russia"" in neighboring Syria.Last year, Israel’s former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, attempted briefly to mediate between the sides, flying to Moscow shortly after Russia’s invasion and meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Bennett said an interview earlier this month that Putin assured him at the time that Russia would not kill Zelenskyy."

Ukraine is counting on continued Western military aid to repel Russian advances and to launch its own offensives.The truck-mounted Archer is a so-called ""shoot and scoot"" weapon, able to quickly fire a succession of three rounds and be on the move again before the first shell hits its target.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that Ukraine's Western suppliers are ""in a race of logistics"" to stop Russia from seizing the battlefield initiative.Archer cannons will join other Western-supplied equipment that has helped tilt artillery engagements in Ukraine's favor, along with French-made Caesar howitzers, U.S.-supplied HIMARS and other precision-strike systems.Zelenskyy described the Archer as ""one of the best artillery pieces"" and predicted it would impact Russia's invasion forces on the battlefield.""The stronger Ukraine is now, the sooner the Russian aggression ends,"" he said.Kristersson was less emphatic about another weapons system on Kyiv's wish-list: Fighter planes.He didn't rule out such support. But he suggested that Sweden wouldn't want to go it alone as a potential supplier and that other nations would have to rally around the idea of plane deliveries, as they eventually did around sending NATO-standard tanks to Ukraine.Kristersson said Sweden's drive to join NATO — along with fellow candidate nation Finland — will also play into its thinking about military supplies to Ukraine.Being a candidate for NATO membership ""puts us in a very special situation right now. We have very obvious reasons to be very careful with our own defense right now."" he said.""We will do everything we can to support Ukraine and we will do it in a way that doesn't adventure or risk the Swedish ability to defend ourselves, because that is a core competence for a NATO-applicant country to uphold,"" the prime minister said."

It had been detected initially by radar systems in Romanian airspace at an altitude of about 36,000 feet.""The crews of the two aircraft did not confirm the presence of the aerial target, neither visually nor on the onboard radars,"" a ministry statement said, adding that the two MiG-21 LanceR aircraft stayed in the vicinity for about 30 minutes before returning to base.It was unclear whether the two incidents were related, and neither country said where they believed the objects had come from.The events follow a string of comparable incidents this month in the U.S., in which objects detected and shot down by warplanes included a high-altitude Chinese balloon that traversed American airspace. China said it was a weather balloon that had accidentally drifted off course.The incident in Moldova triggered widespread travel disruption and brief panic when authorities temporarily closed the country's airspace over what they later described as an object ""similar to a weather balloon"" spotted near the northern border with Ukraine.Scores of flights in the country of about 2.6 million people, one of Europe’s poorest, were canceled or rescheduled. Some were diverted to Romania.""Given the weather conditions and the impossibility of monitoring and identifying the object as well as its flight path … the decision was taken to temporarily close the airspace,"" Moldova's aviation authority said in a statement.Romania has been a NATO member since 2004 and a European Union member since 2007.

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-condemns-russian-use-iranian-drones-ukraine,,2023-02-14T16:40:05-05:00,US condemns Russian use of Iranian drones in Ukraine,"'Iran is a partner in the conflict with Russia,' a US defense official stated","American defense officials on Tuesday sought to dispel any doubt that Iran is supplying drones for Russia’s war in Ukraine, releasing photos and analysis of unmanned aircraft deployed in the conflict to demonstrate Tehran’s involvement.During a briefing in London, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency displayed photos of drones that attacked Ukraine alongside images of those previously traced to Iran. A comparison of design details such as tail fins, nose cones and landing gear shows that the weapons used in Ukraine are ""indistinguishable"" from Shahed-131 and -136 attack drones and Mohajer 6 unmanned aerial vehicles used in the Middle East.The effort to ""show the homework’’ is intended to help persuade governments or international agencies of Tehran’s involvement. Iran has said it supplied a ""small number"" of drones to Russia before the invasion of Ukraine but has denied providing any more since troops crossed the border last February.The evidence proves otherwise, an official from the Defense Intelligence Agency said while speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information.""Iran is a partner in the conflict with Russia,’’ the official said.U.S. officials also suggested that Iran was gleaning valuable information by deploying its technology in Ukraine, including how the drones perform in different weather conditions, seeing how they can be used under different scenarios and getting real life feedback that allows them to make the weapons more effective.For example, after learning that civilians were able to flee because they could hear the drones approaching, weapons designers are likely to make future models quieter, the official said.The war in Ukraine also allows Iran to demonstrate the capabilities of its technology to other potential buyers.""Iran sees this as a great marketing opportunity,’’ the official added.The analysis was released a day after Britain presented evidence that Iran is supplying advanced weapons to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.Britain presented drones and missiles seized from vessels in the Gulf of Oman to the United Nations as evidence that Iran is violating Security Council resolutions barring weapons shipments to the Houthis.The timing of the release suggests Western powers are hardening their stance on Iran, said Tobias Borck, a research fellow for Middle East security studies at the Royal United Services Institute.For the last 20 years, Iran policy has been focused on limiting Iran’s nuclear program. But efforts to resuscitate talks on a nuclear deal are stalled, and officials in Washington, London and Brussels have begun to shift their messaging.The idea that an agreement could be a confidence building measure paving the way to resolving other issues in the region is vanishing."
FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/world/reporters-notebook-italian-support-ukraine-the-wane-according-recent-poll,Amy Kellogg,2023-02-14T11:22:30-05:00,Reporter's Notebook: Italian support for Ukraine on the wane according to recent poll,Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recently said he had a very negative view of Zelenskyy,"""If I were prime minister, I would never go talk to Zelenskyy,"" Berlusconi said, adding, ""We are assisting in the destruction of his country, the killing of his soldiers and civilians. All that was needed was for him to stop attacking the two autonomous republics in the Donbas, and this would never have happened.""  Nevermind that in the minds of many, Putin provoked the initial hostilities in the Donbas back in 2014 and stirred it up with his agents before turning around and saying that Russian speakers were under attack.The current Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, who met with Zelenskyy last week in Brussels and is planning to visit Kyiv, was quick to enact damage control. Berlusconi is the leader of one of the parties in her coalition government, and during the election campaign she had to constantly push back against suggestions that a right-wing government would be soft on Russia. This, in part because of Berlusconi’s longstanding friendship with Putin. Her office issued a statement immediately after Berlusconi’s rant, saying that Italy’s support of Ukraine is ""solid and unwavering."" And in that, Italy is officially in lockstep with its European partners.Still, the fact that Berlusconi made those comments as local elections were taking place in some regions does suggest that the wily 86-year-old politician believes there is a significant part of the population who thinks just like he does.According to Professor Lorenzo De Sio at Rome’s Luiss University, old pro-Russian sentiment dies hard around here. ""Italy is at the crossroads between the European world and the Mediterranean world. It was at the crossroads between East and West during the times of the Iron Curtain. It’s important to remember that Italy used to have the strongest Communist Party in Western Europe."" With that, De Sio, says, comes a lingering critical attitude toward the United States in some corners, and positive attitudes toward Russia, which, by the way, has been a very strong trading partner for Italy. Italy had always worked hard at holding neutral ground when it came to Moscow versus the West.De Sio does believe that most Italians support President Zelenskyy and Ukraine and are horrified by the scale of death and destruction being visited on the country, but the numbers do not unequivocally back that up. A poll right after the war broke out found ""57% of the population took the side of Ukraine, 38%  took no side and just five percent sided with Russia,"" De Sio explains, adding that a recent Ipsos poll found that things had changed significantly. ""Support for Ukraine has dropped from 57% to 45% percent,"" and the group that supports neither side has gone from 38% to 47%. De Sio says data shows just 41% of Italians support sending weapons to Ukraine, and 52% oppose it.So, are there are a lot of closet Putin supporters among those who publicly don’t take sides in this war? It is not clear, but De Sio believes that many in that segment opposed to arming Ukraine are mostly disillusioned that diplomacy has not found a way and are frightened of further escalation.Meanwhile, Berlusconi did hint that he wanted to be that missing peace bridge. He claimed to have re-established relations with Putin last fall after the Russian leader sent him twenty bottles of vodka for his birthday and a ""very sweet note."" Berlusconi said he sent back an abundance of Lambrusco."

The trial was part of the Kremlin’s sweeping, months-long crackdown on dissent.Russia’s Investigative Committee announced launching a case against Belotserkovskaya on March 16 2022, several weeks after Moscow's troops rolled into Ukraine. It was the first publicly-known case under a new law adopted earlier that month that penalized information seen as disparaging to the Russian military.The Russian authorities issued an arrest order for the blogger in absentia, put her on a wanted list and seized roughly $2.2 million worth of her assets.She was also declared a ""foreign agent,"" a designation that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations aimed at discrediting the recepient.Belotserkovskaya by far has been handed the longest prison sentence under the new law and is the second prominent public figure to be sentenced in absentia.Last week, a Moscow court sentenced Alexander Nevzorov, a television journalist and former lawmaker, in absentia to eight years in prison on the same charges. Nevzorov was accused of posting ""false information"" on social media about the Russian shelling of a maternity hospital in the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol. Moscow has fiercely denied its involvement.The journalist moved abroad after the start of the Ukrainian conflict.In December, prominent opposition politician Ilya Yashin was sentenced to 8½ years in prison under the same law.

The proposed aid package will be put to a vote in parliament.Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that overall, the European Union’s economic, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine now amounts to almost 50 billion euros. Earlier this month, the EU said it would unveil its 10th package of sanctions against Russia on the Feb. 24 anniversary of the war. It will target technology used by Russia’s war machine, among other things.Norway, which isn't an EU member, gave Ukraine more than $1 billion in civilian and military aid last year.""It will lead to an increased use of oil money,"" Gahr Støre said, adding that he's hoping ""a large majority"" in the Norwegian parliament would approve the aid package. A parliamentary majority is expected to pass the proposal.""Supporting Ukraine is supporting a people experiencing war, but it is also support for our fundamental security,"" Gahr Støre told a press conference.At a conference earlier Monday in Oslo, Gahr Støre spoke of a new Iron Curtain dividing east and west.The government in Oslo also proposed to increase the aid to countries that are hit by the war in Ukraine by  $490 million -– that money should be used on humanitarian aid and food.Last week, the Norwegian government said that oil profits should go toward funding more aid to Ukraine.Norway is one of Europe’s largest fossil-fuel exporters, and the conflict in Ukraine has boosted its gas revenues. However, Norway has fended off accusations that it’s profiting from the war in Ukraine.A rush by European countries to secure alternative energy sources following Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago dramatically increased the demand — and price — for Norway’s oil and gas."

The former prime minister traveled to Moscow and met with Putin in March 2022, and he detailed their conversation during an interview posted online on Saturday.""I asked ‘what’s with this? Are you planning to kill Zelenskyy?’ He said ‘I won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ I then said to him ‘I have to understand that you’re giving me your word that you won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ He said ‘I’m not going to kill Zelenskyy,'"" Bennett said of their conversation.Bennett said he then called Zelenskyy to tell him the news.""’Listen, I came out of a meeting, he’s not going to kill you.’ He asks, ‘are you sure?’ I said ‘100% he won’t kill you,'"" Bennett said.Revelations of Putin's promise come just weeks before the one-year anniversary of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts have since fizzled out, however, and Zelenskyy now says he is unwilling to speak with Putin until he withdraws his forces from Ukraine.Other Ukrainian officials have dismissed Bennett's statement, arguing Putin was simply lying.""Do not be fooled: [Putin] is an expert liar.

After an eight-day ""slogging match,"" the Russians won by what one military historian called ""suicidal bravery"" by getting close enough to throw mines under the tanks and having aircraft pick off German tanks from above. Consistent with Russia’s warfare style, Soviet forces out-sacrificed the Germans, with the Russians losing 3,800 tanks, while the Germans lost 760.Putin views the war in Ukraine as his Cuban missile crisis, as Ukraine’s potential acceptance into NATO would bring the alliance even closer to Russia’s borders. Moscow is putting everything on the line to minimize this risk that it views as unacceptable. The Pentagon is foolish to assume that the Abrams tank will become a game-changer in the war and will bring peace to Ukraine.It is for this reason that every Abrams that is sold to foreign customers, even allies, has the depleted uranium armor – which is intended to mitigate vulnerabilities – removed, according to the specialized military website, Breaking Defense. What has become an unrestricted supply of top of the line materiel to Ukraine – which is not, officially, even a U.S. ally – drives up the risk of these secrets falling into our adversaries’ hands.The Wall Street Journal recently called out the U.S. armaments industry for its unpreparedness for a China conflict. Washington’s erratic actions during the highly-consequential Russia-Ukraine conflict, have exposed an absence of planning and strategy within the Biden administration.

He told reporters in Berlin that the application from industry to permit delivery of Leopard 1 tanks had been made ""some time"" ago.Hebestreit's comments came after the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that the government had cleared the export of the tanks and that they could be sent as soon as the defense industry gets them in working order.It said that two companies, Rheinmetall and FFG, want to prepare dozens of Leopard 1 tanks that could be delivered to Ukraine if it is interested. But it also said that there are issues so far with securing sufficient ammunition for the vehicles. It wasn't immediately clear when any deliveries might be possible, but it appeared unlikely to be a quick process.The Leopard 1, manufactured between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s, was the first battle tank built for West Germany's Bundeswehr. The German military hasn't had any of the tanks since 2003, Defense Ministry spokesman Arne Collatz said.Germany last week agreed to send 14 modern Leopard 2 A6 tanks from its military's current stocks. Several other European countries have equipped their armies with Leopard 2 tanks, and Germany’s move — which followed weeks of mounting pressure to supply battle tanks — meant that they also can give some of their stocks to Ukraine.The United States has said it will send 31 M1 Abrams tanks.Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, welcomed Friday's announcement from Berlin."

Those numbers are up a touch compared to six months ago, when approval was 61% for weapons and 59% for money.About 8 in 10 Democrats back continuing financial (79%) and weapon support (79%). Fewer Republicans and independents feel that way, as just over half favor sending additional funding (51% and 55% respectively) and weapons (55% and 56%).Some 68% of voters are concerned about the war, down from a high of 82% in March 2022, which was soon after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. These days, more are worried about inflation (86%), crime rates (80%), political divisions within the U.S. (78%), and opioid addiction across the country (76%).Democrats (61%) are more likely than independents (50%) and Republicans (42%) to believe Ukraine is winning and to be concerned about the war (76% of Democrats are concerned vs. 64% of Republicans and 61% of independents).Of the issues included on the survey, Biden receives his best marks for how he’s handling Russia/Ukraine: 45% approve, while 51% disapprove. That’s better than his ratings on the economy (37-61%), border security (35-61%), immigration (35-61%), and inflation (31-66%).Part of what pushes Biden’s Russia/Ukraine ratings higher is that 21% of Republicans approve – more than double what they give him on any other issue.The president’s overall job performance rating stands at 45% approve vs. 54% disapprove, which is right around where it’s been since September."

He did not reveal how large the contribution will be, but he said the government would make it soon.""We are in a situation where we have room for action due to extraordinary income from the petroleum sector,"" said the prime minister, who leads Norway’s Labor Party. He said the aid would be arranged in a way that has very little impact on the level of activity in the Norwegian economy.Norway is one of Europe’s largest fossil-fuel exporters, and the conflict in Ukraine has boosted its gas revenues. However, Norway has fended off accusations that it's profiting from the war in Ukraine. Last year, the country gave Ukraine more than $1 billion in civilian and military aid.""We are now stepping up this aid.

Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs meetings of the bloc’s heads of state and government, will hold a summit in Kyiv on Friday with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Despite the continuing ruthless attacks of the aggressor, we are seeing a major momentum of reforms in Ukraine,"" Hahn said. But he noted that ""the EU accession path is a marathon, not a sprint"" and that the EU's 27 member countries must agree unanimously for Ukraine to join one day.It’s not clear exactly how the reforms can move at an accelerated pace almost one year into the war and with an economy being drained by defense spending and which relies on injections of foreign financial assistance, much of it from the United States and Europe.Visibly things are moving. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy’s government continued its recent crackdown on alleged corruption with the dismissal of more high-ranking officials. But an EU advisory mission set up in Kyiv in 2014 said then that it would take at least a decade to make a dent in the problem.In a new report this week, the anti-corruption group Transparency International praised Ukraine for the steady progress it has made in battling the scourge in recent years, although it ranks the country a low 116 out of the 180 countries listed for perceived corruption.""However, Russia’s war of aggression has disrupted some of the reform processes and exacerbated corruption risks. Reconstruction and recovery efforts can be drastically undermined by wrongdoers pocketing funds, both during the war and after,"" the report said.EU member countries are divided over whether Ukraine should be allowed in. France and Germany, notably, believe that the bloc should be reformed and its decision-making processes streamlined before it allows in any new members.They’ve championed a new grouping, the European Political Community, whose inaugural meeting in Prague last year was attended by representatives from more than 40 countries. Another summit is scheduled in Moldova in June.During the visit, the EU announced that it’s ramping up its military training mission for Ukraine, from an initial target of pushing 15,000 troops through the schooling to up to 30,000 troops. One focus is to train the crews of tanks that Western countries have offered Ukraine, Borrell said."

Sikorski was foreign minister at the time of the disaster and is now a member of the European Parliament and an outspoken government critic.Sikorski belongs to Civic Platform, a party that has been in opposition since 2015.

We support it and we will support it.

Meanwhile, 31% of Americans say the U.S. is giving the correct amount of aid, down significantly from the fall. Another 20% said they would like to see the U.S. give more aid, while 20% also said they were not sure.Pew Research conducted the poll from Jan. 18-24, surveying 5,152 U.S. adults, according to the Washington Post.Biden's administration has delivered tens of billions worth of military support to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He announced last week that the Pentagon would deliver 31 M1 Abrams tanks to the country in the latest package.The U.S. has already supplied thousands of combat vehicles, including 1,700 Humvees, and pledged earlier this month to send another 500 armored vehicles of various types.The new rush of aid last week comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears the one-year mark. Russia has also announced plans to expand the size of its military to 1.5 million troops in the coming years with a series of conscriptions.Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the troop increase on Tuesday, and it is expected to be completed by 2026, according to Russian state news agency TASS.""Only by strengthening the key structural components of the Armed Forces is it possible to guarantee the military security of the state and protect new entities and critical facilities of the Russian Federation,"" Shoigu said, according to Reuters.Russia's military has around 1 million troops, and it is difficult to estimate how many have been killed in the fighting with Ukraine.The Kremlin previously considered the size of its armed forces as sufficient, but that changed after hopes for a quick victory over its neighbor were shattered by a fierce Ukrainian resistance.Fox News' Caitlan McFall contributed to this report.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Disintegration of Russia, change of the government? There is also talk of tearing Russia apart. This is mad,"" he added.Milanovic won the presidential election in Croatia in 2019 as a left-leaning liberal candidate, a counterpoint to the conservative government currently in power in the European Union and NATO-member state. But he has since made a turn to populist nationalism and criticized Western policies toward Russia as well as the Balkans.Milanovic has built a reputation of being pro-Russian, which he has repeatedly denied. Yet in recent months, he has openly opposed the admission of Finland and Sweden into NATO as well as the training of Ukrainian troops in Croatia as part of EU aid to the embattled country.On Monday, the Croatian president expanded his narrative by saying he believes that Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, will never again be part of Ukraine.After months of hesitation, the U.S. said it will send 31 of its 70-ton Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, and Germany announced it will dispatch 14 Leopard 2 tanks and allow other countries to do the same.""What is the goal of this war? A war against a nuclear power that is at war in another country? Is there a conventional way to defeat such a country?"" Milanovic asked on Monday. ""Who pays the price? Europe. America pays the least,"" he said.Although the presidential post is mostly ceremonial in Croatia, Milanovic is formally the supreme commander of the armed forces. His latest anti-Western outbursts have embarrassed and irritated the country’s government which has fully supported Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s aggression.""The summary of that narrative is: let’s sit down as soon as possible, let the Russians take away I don’t know how many thousands of square kilometers of Ukraine and forget about the expansion of NATO,"" Plenkovic said."

In addition to the destruction of half of Ukraine’s power grid which has plunged Uzhhrod and most of the Zakarpattia region into freezing nights and days without electricity, Archbishop Borys Gudziak of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church said that over 2,000 Ukrainian schools, 500 hospitals, 150,000 dwellings, and 20,000 miles of road have been destroyed. ""This is genocide,"" he said.Last week, the U.S. and Germany finally agreed to give Ukraine the tanks for which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading.  America’s gas-guzzling M-1 Abrams tanks and Germany’s Leopard 2’s, more flexible and easier to operate, may help Kyiv take the military initiative ahead of an expected new Russian offensive this spring.Recently, Washington announced yet another package of $2.5 billion in arms -- Stryker armored combat vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and the Patriot, the most advanced ground-based air defense system. But Ukraine has been begging for such advanced weapons for months. America’s endless internal dithering has delayed giving Ukraine what it needs to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from systematically razing the country.Individuals, too, have demonstrated astonishing creativity. Hours after the Russian invasion, Jose Andres, who created the World Central Kitchen, sent food workers to help feed refugees crossing the border. Since then, some 4,500 staff and Ukrainian volunteer ""food fighters"" --chefs, drivers, warehouse managers, and logistics experts— have helped serve over 1 million meals a day throughout the country.""It only takes two-to-five minutes for a wounded person to bleed out,"" he said.

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukrainian-tv-star-fundraises-100-million-for-countrys-army,Nana Sajaia,2023-01-28T13:15:47-05:00,Ukrainian TV star fundraises $100 million for country's army,Some reports suggest Prytula has presidential aspirations,"When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special operation"" on the night of February 24, one of Ukraine’s biggest showmen, Serhiy Prytula, was on a train heading to Lviv, the furthest city in Western Ukraine, where he was studying for a master's of public administration at the Ukrainian Catholic University, a prestigious private university.Two years earlier, a prominent TV presenter and highly requested showman, he had established a charity foundation called the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation, which supported Ukrainians in need, from autistic children to cancer patients. Now his country was being invaded by a superpower. His reaction was to start fundraising for the Ukrainian army. Today, his foundation employs 100 people along with dozens of volunteers.""The Facebook page just reminded me that in December, 2021 we had a meeting with our donors. I told them our foundation has raised about $250,000. That was a success story at the moment, but today, we crossed the line - 3.9 billion Ukrainian Hryvnias (roughly $100 million). It feels way better"", Prytula tells Fox News.Over the last 11 months, the foundation has donated more than 11 thousand communication devices, almost four thousand drones and over 900 cars to the Ukrainian army, as well as over 13,000 individual first aid kits, and it has arranged combat medicine training for six thousand individuals.On top of assisting the armed forces, the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation has delivered about 15 tons of food to more than 250,000 citizens in war-affected areas.Individual initiatives like those by Prytula Foundation are the very reason Ukrainians call themselves ""a nation of volunteers,"" adviser to the Defense Ministry Yuriy Sak tells Fox News, recalling how Ukrainians came together in the face of the annexation, and thousands enlisted to volunteer for the armed forces.""Even though we knew we had a dangerous enemy, who sooner or later was going to attack us, the ministry of defense wasn't able to immediately provide for the newly arrived hundreds of thousands of soldiers. This is why during the first month or two of this war, when new soldiers were arriving, they were unequipped,"" Sak noted.According to Sak, the original mission of ""a nation of volunteers"" was to ensure that soldiers were well equipped: ""So volunteer engagement was dedicated mostly to providing things like bulletproof vests, helmets, tourniquets, medical kits, because we knew the enemy was ruthless"".Eleven months since Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine, Western allies are pledging a massive weapons package for Ukraine to defend itself from Russia's aggression and repel its troops from occupied territories.Every other military package Ukraine has received for the last 11 months has gradually increased, from lightweight anti-tank Javelins to the Patriot air defense battery."

Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people.The bombardments followed announcements by the United States and Germany of plans to ship powerful tanks to help Ukraine defend itself. Other Western countries said they also would share modern tanks from their stockpiles.Moscow has bristled at the move, and accused Western nations of entering a new level of confrontation with Russia.Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russian military used fiercely-burning phosphorus munitions in its shelling of the village of Zvanivka, about 20 kilometers north of Bakhmut, a city that has become the focus of a grueling standoff in recent months. The shelling also damaged apartment buildings and two schools in the nearby town of Vuhledar, Kyrylenko said.The governor of the neighboring Luhansk region, Serhii Haidai, said Ukrainian shelling hit two Russian bases in the occupied towns of Kreminna and Rubizhne, killing and wounding ""dozens"" of Russian soldiers. His claim couldn’t be independently verified.Further south, Russian troops resumed shelling the town of Nikopol, across the river Dnieper from the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, damaging apartment buildings, gas pipelines, power lines and a bakery, officials said.Separately on Friday, Russian authorities took new steps in their months-long and widely criticized effort to graft four Ukrainian provinces onto Russia’s already vast territory. They said the illegally annexed provinces would change from the time zone that covers Kyiv to the one in Moscow.Russian President Vladimir Putin’s highly orchestrated announcement of the illegal annexations came despite widespread international condemnation and the fact that Russia didn’t fully control the areas it annexed. Russia claims to control nearly all of Luhansk and about half of Donetsk.Less than 1-1/2 months after the annexations, Russia lost control of the city of Kherson and broad swaths of the surrounding territory following a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Kherson was the only regional capital Russia seized since starting its invasion on Feb. 24, and its loss dealt a heavy blow to the Kremlin.Planned Western deployments of modern tanks for Ukraine remained on many minds on Friday.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Canada’s CTV that his country was ready to send 60 modern tanks — half of them the PT-91 model, which was built in Poland from 1994 to 2001 as a modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72M1. He said those deliveries would come on top of Poland’s plans to send 14 of its Leopard 2s, after Berlin approved other allies sending the German-made tanks to Ukraine.The German government insisted Friday that it does not see itself in direct conflict with Russia, after Moscow seized on comments by Germany’s top diplomat this week that suggested otherwise.""We support Ukraine, but we are not parties to the war,"" she added.- Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said Russia used its latest hypersonic Kinzhal missiles to strike energy facilities in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia regions Thursday. He said Ukraine lacks defenses against the Kinzhal, adding that Russia has few such missiles and mostly uses them against priority targets.Ihnat said in televised remarks that Russia also used Kh-55 missiles — air-launched missiles that were designed to carry nuclear warheads — with dummy warheads to distract Ukraine’s air defenses.- Russian state-run media say the state communications watchdog has restricted access to the CIA and FBI websites for allegedly spreading materials ""containing inaccurate socially significant information"" and ""discrediting"" Russia’s armed forces. The Russian government has made it illegal to discredit its troops or spread ""false information"" about the military."

The U.S. decision followed Germany’s agreement to send 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks from its own stocks.""The U.S. is the arch criminal which poses serious threat and challenge to the strategic security of Russia and pushes the regional situation to the present grave phase,"" she said.""I do not doubt that any military hardware the U.S. and the West boast of will be burnt into pieces in the face of the indomitable fighting spirit and might of the heroic Russian army and people,"" she said, adding that North Korea will always ""stand in the same trench"" with Russia.North Korea is the only nation other than Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and has also hinted at plans to send workers there to help with rebuilding efforts."

Remaining indifferent is tantamount to condoning murder,"" he said in a statement that echoed Zelenskyy's warning.One Auschwitz survivor said Russia’s war in Ukraine has recreated a ""feeling of horror"" in a Europe, whose leaders pledged ""never again"" after Nazi atrocities were uncovered in the wake of WWII.One image of girl holding her mother’s hand while clutching a teddy bear in the other drew images of himself on a train headed for the concentration camp.""It was literally a blow to the head for me because I suddenly saw, after almost 80 years, what I had seen in a freight car when I was being transported to Auschwitz.

But when using the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, program, it could take months or years because the government goes through procurement to identify and hire contractors to build the weapons.Biden announced the weapons approval on Wednesday, just hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said Ukraine would also get Leopard 2 tanks from Berlin as Russia plans for a major offensive.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Defense Secretary joined the president Antony Blinkin, who described the tanks as the ""most capable tanks in the world"" which will enhance Ukraine’s ability on the battlefield.""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" Biden said.Earlier this month, Germany suggested it would not agree to send its tanks to Ukraine unless the U.S. did as well, citing concerns over escalating the war.While senior defense officials would not confirm if the decision was a stipulation of Berlin’s or motivation from Washington to get Germany to roll out the Leopard tanks, the move was championed as a show of long-term support for Ukraine.The U.S. has already supplied thousands of combat vehicles, including 1,700 Humvees and pledged earlier this month to send another 500 armored vehicles of several types.The Abrams tanks will be procured through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and will not come directly from U.S. stockpiles.It remains unclear how long it will take to get the Abrams tanks up and running in Ukraine and defense officials did not say where the trainings will take place, though it was confirmed that the trainings would be held outside of Ukraine.Caitlin McFall of Fox News contributed to this report.Greg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital."

European Union (EU) and U.S. diplomats have applied pressure of late, issuing warnings that Belgrade must accept the plan advanced by the EU Special Representative for the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue to normalize relations with Kosovo.The EU sponsored plan, first reported by Serbian media, does not require Serbia to fully recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. Instead, Serbia must stop blocking Kosovo’s membership in international organizations such as the Council of Europe or NATO. Serbia’s continued intransigence would threaten Serbia’s hopes of joining the EU and receiving greater amounts of Western investment.""The EU proposal was submitted to the Parties as basis to work on in order to achieve progress in moving the Dialogue on normalization of their relations forward and get us from the permanent crisis management as we have seen since last summer with incidents, escalations and confrontations, to a more sustainable process of normalization,"" Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at the European Commission, told Fox News Digital.However, the EU proposal has not been made public since the diplomatic efforts are ongoing, and its longstanding policy not to comment on alleged leaks or media reports claiming to have seen or published the document, Spano added.Despite the positive news, Western officials fear that Russia, preoccupied with the invasion of Ukraine, may use the opportunity to scuttle any plan and meddle in a region where Moscow exerts significant cultural and political sway. Russia wields its soft power in support of its Slavic and Orthodox Christian allies in Serbia.Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to keep the Balkan region divided and prevent it from comfortably integrating into institutions such as NATO and the EU. Moscow supports anti-Western and often corrupt officials in Serbia and across the Balkans who disrupt the good governance measures that need to be implemented in order to join the EU. From Putin’s perspective, causing trouble in the Balkans is an easy and cheap way to drive a wedge in Europe.At its disposal, Russia utilizes its energy resources and extensive intelligence networks in the region to push propaganda, conduct cyber espionage and fund sympathetic political parties. Belgrade also imports nearly a quarter of its oil from Russia and signed a three-year gas deal with Russia, flouting Europe’s pivot away from Russian energy.Although the EU is Serbia’s largest donor, Russia uses its influence to curry favor with like-minded political actors, media figures and citizens in Serbia to promote its anti-Western and anti-U.S. worldview in a vulnerable corner of Europe. Serbian society is also partially receptive to Russian narratives particularly on Ukraine. A poll conducted across the territory of the former Yugoslavia shortly after the invasion on Feb. 24 showed that a majority of Serbs blamed the U.S. and NATO for the war and not Russia.The European Union and NATO would like to see a resolution to the conflict, but President Vucic is an enigmatic figure who likes to play both sides of the divide. While Serbia is an EU aspirant, Vucic regularly talks up Serbia’s ties to Russia and his personal connection with Putin for domestic political purposes. Like Putin, Vucic often invokes the trauma of the 1990s to reinforce a grievance narrative that Serbia was a victim of western overreach.Russia’s war in Ukraine, while solidifying European unity not seen since the days of the Cold War, has upended Vucic’s pragmatic attempt to play off both sides. Serbia joined U.N. resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the referendums annexing territory in the eastern Donbas region, and voted to boot Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.Although Vucic has shifted against Russia in some ways, Serbia is still one of the few nations that was reluctant to join sanctions targeting Russia following the invasion. Additionally, while almost all nations in Europe shut their airspace to Russian flights, Serbia has kept their airspace open. Further compounding the balancing act Vucic finds himself in, the Serbian military trains with both NATO and Russia.""Thus far, President Vucic has successfully maintained this balancing act, however, the space for this balancing act continues to narrow down as EU and U.S. representatives keep pressuring Serbia to align itself with the West,"" Ivanov said.The territorial dispute between Serbia and Kosovo following the 1999 war is unresolved and is a roadblock to further European integration. Kosovo was a former province of Serbia and was once integrated within the nation of Yugoslavia. NATO led a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, which comprised Serbia and Montenegro, to defend Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians against violence from Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and Serbia thus far refuses to recognize their independence.""In Serbia, where officials frequently play the victim card, Russia is therefore portrayed as righteous as it was on the side of the victims rather than what they perceive as NATO ‘perpetrators.’ As such, the anti-NATO card resonates with many Serbs throughout the region, from Serbia to Bosnia and Herzegovina"", Leon Hartwell, non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Fox News Digital.The EU is often criticized for not taking a harder stance against Serbia and its both-sides posture toward Russia. However, observers note that the EU’s recent pressure campaign might finally lead to Serbia changing its behavior and moving closer toward the West."

Host Tucker Carlson remarked the email read like no other missive on the laptop, but could have been mistaken for one written in official State Department jargon or the like.""The strategic values to create a land bridge for RU [Russia] to Crimea. That won't directly affect Burisma holdings, but it will limit future UK exploration and utilization of offshore opportunities in particular. It will also further destabilize the UK nationally and for whatever government is in power and the US will respond with even stronger sanctions. Those sanctions will threaten the tenuous support of the EU, which does not have the political will to incur steep energy price increases"" and so on,"" the email read, host Tucker Carlson reported.Devine remarked the email ""reads like a classified document,"" with Carlson noting Hunter even used the diplomatic ""RU"" abbreviation for the Russian Federation.""There's information in there that is not readily available. He sounds very knowledgeable and very breezy about it. And you have to remember that this is at a time – a month before he joined the Burisma board. He needed money desperately, to feed his drug habit, and they were going to pay him $83,000 a month to do not very much,"" Devine added.She said that if Hunter were to have had access to classified information, that would drive ""his price much higher"" on the foreign business front.Devine said it should be easy for authorities to discern whether Hunter may have had access to Obama-Biden-era classified materials, considering whether Special Counsel Robert K. Hur could cross-match that email and other information on the laptop the Delaware documents, or even those found in Washington at the University of Pennsylvania facility.She noted that the little the public has been told of the first tranche of documents found in Delaware pertain to the U.K., Ukraine and Iran – pointing out Hunter's email talks about the U.K. and Ukraine in particular.""So it's kind of a guess at this point, but it's a pretty obvious connection,"" she said.Devine added another prudent step would be for Hur, the former Baltimore federal prosecutor looking into the Biden documents scandal, to connect with Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as he oversees the investigation centered around Hunter.Charles covers media, politics and breaking news, and has covered the annual CPAC conference for Fox News Digital.Charles is a Pennsylvania native and graduated from Temple University with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism.

He was charged alongside Sergey Shestakov, a former Soviet and Russian diplomat who later became a U.S. citizen and a Russian interpreter for courts and government offices, through a five-count indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court Monday.McGonigal and Shestakov both were arrested Saturday. The indictment is a rare move by federal prosecutors to bring charges against a former senior FBI official before a federal grand jury.Though not referenced in or related to the indictment, McGonigal, while serving as chief of the cybercrimes section at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., was one of the first bureau officials to learn of allegations that George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser for former President Donald Trump, boasted that he knew Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton, launching the investigation into alleged Russian election interference known as Operation Crossfire Hurricane, Business Insider previously reported. Fox News is told that as a senior counterintelligence official at the time, he likely was briefed on Crossfire Hurricane at the time the investigation was launched.Both men are charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (""IEEPA""), one count of violating the IEEPA, one count of conspiring to commit money laundering, and one count of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Shestakov is also charged with one count of making false statements, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, prosecutors said.It was then-President Barack Obama who in 2014 issued Executive Order 13660, which declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea.On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") designated Deripaska as a Specially Designated National (""SDN""), sanctioning him for acting on behalf of a senior official of the Russian Federation’s government and for operating in the Russian energy sector.As part of their negotiations with Deripaska’s agent, McGonigal, Shestakov and the agent attempted to conceal Deripaska’s involvement by, among other means, not directly naming Deripaska in electronic communications, using shell companies as counterparties in the contract that outlined the services to be performed, using a forged signature on that contract, and using the same shell companies to send and receive payments from Deripaska, according to the indictment.EDITOR'S NOTE: This report has been updated to clarify McGonigal's reported connection to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation."

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putins-pivot-ukraine-bring-permanent-war-europe,Rebekah Koffler,2023-01-24T08:00:03-05:00,Putin's pivot in Ukraine will bring about permanent war in Europe,Putin is making significant changes to Russia's military strategy as the war against Ukraine nears the one year mark,"Last week, Russia announced that it will make ""major changes"" to strengthen its armed forces’ during the 2023-2026 time period, a sign that Moscow is recasting its approach in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s new strategy is focused on fighting a large-scale war rather than a ""special military operation."" Here’s why this change will likely result in a permanent conflict in the European theater.Ukraine is the buffer state that each side seeks to rely on in the event of a direct NATO vs. Russia war. Trading territory for enemy’s blood to protect the heartland is the essence of this approach. It is why the question of control over Ukraine has been festering since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, and it is where the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries.Having won the Cold War, the U.S. has been incorporating Ukraine into the Western orbit, allowing the U.S. and Europe to reduce their military posture in Europe. Ukrainians are valiantly fighting the Russians, having sacrificed thousands of military personnel and 20,000 to 40,000 civilians to death or injury to hold the line, while the majority of NATO countries, 22 of 30, fail to contribute the required two percent of GDP towards common defense. Washington views the arming of Ukraine as a sound investment to bleed the Russian military.Moscow views NATO expansion into Ukraine in the same way as if a Russia-lead Collective Security Treaty Organization moved into Mexico. In other words, the outcome of this war is existential for Putin, who is determined to keep Ukraine away from NATO, even if he has to destroy it.Putin is moving to an all-out war strategy, developed on his orders after the Russian military strategists forecast a direct confrontation with NATO a decade ago.Pantsir anti-aircraft systems were reportedly installed on several rooftops in central Moscow, including near the Kremlin, on top of the ministry of defense building, and near Putin’s Valdai residence in Russia’s Novgorod region. The system is placed on combat alert.Last week, Shoigu emphasized Russia’s goal to augment, naval, aerospace, and nuclear forces, in order ""to guarantee the military security of the state."" Earlier, Putin also assigned the chief of the military general staff, Valeriy Gerasimov, to lead combat operations in Ukraine, a notable move as Gerasimov is the author of a special anti-U.S. doctrine.The Russians sacrificed 25 million lives in World War II and their current losses are approximately 100,000. Given Russia’s population of 143 million, there’s a lot more bleeding that lies ahead before Washington could reach its goals of Ukrainian victory and weakening Russia.Russia shares a turbulent past with both Sweden and Finland dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, having fought multiple wars with them. In fact, Russia defeated Sweden and ended the Great Northern War in July 1709 at the battle of Poltava, which today is located in the eastern part of Ukraine.This long-term impact on Europe and the world will be incalculable.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

They left homes and family behind indefinitely and because their country is on the wrong side of this war, they don’t always feel welcome in their new homes. The situation for them though will become worse if another punitive measure being discussed is acted on. Canceling their Russian citizenship altogether.More chilling, Soldatov says, is the fact that there have even been threats to go after exiles wherever they are."

By 2015, the hired soldiers were doing Putin’s bidding in Syria to support it's president, Bashar al-Assad, and to carry out objectives the Kremlin did not want its military linked to.Wagner is now believed to operate not only in Ukraine and Syria, but across Africa in the Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan, Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Madagascar and possibly Eritrea.""It is also control over deposits of precious metals and stones,"" he added.Kovalenko said that control over natural resources is just one of Russia’s aims.While 10,000 Russian mercenaries are estimated to be spread across Africa, the Wagner enterprise has grown substantially since Putin invaded Ukraine.Ukraine estimates that Russia has lost over 120,000 soldiers, though it is unclear if this also includes Wagner forces as mercenaries not generally considered among military casualties.Wagner forces and Russian troops do not typically work together. Despite the statement from the defense ministry regarding the joint effort to capture Soledar, the Russian government maintains a level of detachment from the mercenary group.Despite asserted separations between the Russian defense ministry and Wagner, they share an undeniable copacetic relationship.Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news."

It can also cause visual recognition issues for individuals with learning disabilities,"" it said.Pennsylvania State University classifies both Times New Roman and Calibri fonts in the same category of fonts with ""reasonable legibility,"" but neither made its list of ""highly recommended fonts"" for accessibility, which include Verdana and Tahoma fonts.""The new font change will make the Department’s written products and communications more accessible. It demonstrates Secretary Blinken's allyship to those with disabilities and underscores his support for employees with disabilities. Moreover, this change underscores that the values and message of disability inclusion are not restricted to any given month or period, but something that should be pursued all year round,"" it said.Brandon Gillespie is an associate editor at Fox News.

It would prevent future Russian aggression in Europe and deter Chinese expansionism by demonstrating western resolve and lethality. It is essential, however, that in providing Ukraine with the support it needs, Washington does it in a way that provides full accountability to the American people and neither adds major unfunded liabilities for the U.S. taxpayer nor consumes resources required to counter the People’s Republic of China.Retaining the ability to confront Russia and China simultaneously will require some of our European allies to do more toward supporting the effort in Ukraine. This will enable the U.S. to shoulder the bulk of the load deterring China in the Pacific.For the United States victory would be a Putin regime that is unable to mount a subsequent attack on a NATO country that could obligate our direct involvement in a European war.President Biden should lay out a strategy to insulate the American people (and our allies) from the fallout of Putin’s energy war. This will require maximizing our production of and access to reliable fuels (oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear) and constructing pipelines and export terminals to move fuels where they are needed for domestic consumption and export.President Biden has justified restricting certain military aid to Ukraine in the hopes of preventing Putin from using a nuclear weapon, but this only allows Putin to hold our aid hostage with nuclear threats as he has been doing since the beginning of the war. The PRC will not be a constructive partner of any sort on Ukraine, but Beijing could help dissuade Putin from using a nuclear weapon if they believe it would harm their own interests.President Biden has politicized the Ukraine issue in Congress. Ukrainian leadership could help restore bipartisan support for assistance to the war effort by more actively engaging with congressional conservatives and addressing their concerns about corruption and a drift into endless war.Congress should set the terms for reconstruction if Ukraine expects American taxpayer investment or U.S. government support for American entities that participate in the reconstruction process. All Americans need to hear directly and unequivocally from President Zelenskyy that their money will not be spent on contracts with PRC entities or to free up other resources for this purpose.Many Americans remain unconvinced that continued engagement in Ukraine is in our vital national interest. The burden is on the Biden administration to make this case. Currently, less than half of the country approve of the way he is handling the situation.If President Biden refuses to work closely with conservatives on Capitol Hill on Ukraine strategy, he risks undermining a year of concerted U.S. engagement, allowing Putin to regroup for potential future aggression and failing to deter China—all of which would be a sad waste of the $100 billion already committed to Ukraine.Victoria Coates is a senior research fellow in Heritage’s Thatcher Center for Freedom."

Dmitry Suslov, deputy head of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the National Research University Higher School of Economics, seemed hopeful that the GOP would use that fact against Biden the next time he seeks billions in new aide to Ukraine.House Republicans have opposed the broad funding proposals put forward by the Biden administration and congressional Democrats. However, many have said they would continue to support Ukraine funding, although that funding might be in small chunks that are focused only on Ukraine’s direct military needs.Another Russian expert, Andrey Koshkin, head of the political science department at the G.V. Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, said the scandal would likely weigh heavily on a president who is not popular among Americans.Rebekah Koffler — president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook"" — said the point of the TASS story is likely to dishearten Ukraine and create new worries that the U.S. will be a less enthusiastic contributor to its defense effort.""They’re trying to sow more division and discourage the US from providing more help,"" she said.Koffler said a third target is the international audience, which she said is part of a broader effort to show how divisive democracies can be.Pete Kasperowicz is a politics editor at Fox News Digital."

The police then moved in to continue forced evacuations of anti-coal protesters encamped there, according to a report from France 24.The village has become a flashpoint for anti-coal protesters in Germany, who have grown frustrated by the country's lack of ability to transition away from the fossil fuel source to greener forms of energy.The encampment of protesters once numbered about 2,000, but police efforts to root them out have dwindled their numbers to around 200 as of Wednesday.Activists sounded alarms as police began to push into the encampment Wednesday, with some demonstrators clinging to trees while others built structures in high spaces in an attempt to evade officers.Protesters led chants against police from loudspeakers while some began an impromptu violin concert from the rooftops of an abandoned house in an attempt to encourage their fellow remaining protesters. Others tied themselves inside metal barrels and resisted attempts by police to talk them out.""We can't untie them, not today anyway. For that, we need special shears"" a police officer said.""We have other things to do at the moment, one thing at a time,"" another added.Despite that, the spokesperson argued that there is a ""clear legal situation"" allowing for the town to be dug up to mine coal, and he encouraged demonstrators to respect the law.""This is part of our democratic understanding, it is part of an agreement, and this is the law in force. The government, therefore, expects the law to be respected, and the police are there to enforce the law,"" the spokesperson said, adding that police would have ""no sympathy"" for violence.But reporters and witnesses on the ground near the town have said the majority of protesters have been peaceful, with one protester saying she has not seen any violence from police or demonstrators.""Everything happened calmly, we were singing carols, then one of my comrades was picked up, and I was pulled with him,"" said Eire, a college student in her 20s.Police have promised that those detained in the clearing operation will not be arrested, but they also noted that the protesters will be removed from the town and prevented from returning.The show of force was made necessary as a result of an agreement that RWE, the energy company that owns the neighboring mine, would expand its operations into Luetzerath to mine for coal, necessitating that the rest of the abandoned town be demolished.On Wednesday, the company took to social media to urge protesters to cooperate with efforts to clear the town, arguing that the expansion of coal mining in the area is needed amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis in Germany.""Luetzerath coal is needed... during the energy crisis and thus use less gas in electricity generation,"" the company wrote."

During his late December visit to the U.S., Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the battery would make a significant difference in bolstering Kyiv's defenses against Russia's invasion.The number of Ukrainians coming to Fort Sill is approximately the number it takes to operate one battery, and they will focus on learning to operate and also maintain the Patriot, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday.Kyiv's decision to take troops off the battlefield to train across the Atlantic in the U.S. is unusual, although it has sent forces for short-term training at European bases for other more complex systems it has received, such as on the longer-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket System.Patriot training normally can take several months, but ""the longer those troops are off the line, they're not actually engaged in combat,"" Ryder said, so the training will be shortened.Fort Sill was selected because it already runs Patriot training schools, Ryder said.The U.S. pledged one Patriot battery in December as part of one of several large military assistance packages it has provided Ukraine in recent weeks. Last week Germany pledged an additional Patriot battery.Each Patriot battery consists of a truck-mounted launching system with eight launchers that can hold up to four missile interceptors each, a ground radar, a control station and a generator. The Army said it currently has 16 Patriot battalions.The Patriot batteries will complement a variety of air defense systems that both the U.S. and NATO partners have pledged to Ukraine, as it faces an evolving barrage of missiles and drones against its civilian population and infrastructure from Russia in the nearly 11-month old conflict. In the last few months Germany has pledged four IRIS-T air defense systems; the U.S. has also pledged eight mid-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and Avenger air defense systems."

His motivation is simple—he seeks to be exceptional in the same way that Napoleon was exceptional. But, after confessing to his crimes and being dispatched to Siberia, Rodion experiences a spiritual metamorphosis and repents for his sins.Somewhere in the bowels of the Kremlin, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, KGB killer and former Mayor of Dostoyevsky’s own St. Petersburg, is pondering the impacts of his 300-day special military operation. But there is no chance for a Rodion-like redemption here.Putin believes he is the reincarnation of Russia’s Imperial and Soviet past. There is no crime, no matter how horrible, that warrants reflection much less redemption when that crime is committed for the advancement of the Russian state. Rodion saw himself as Bonaparte; Putin believes he is the reincarnation of Peter the Great, Alexander I, and Stalin. Peter the Great built cities and opened his country to European thought and mores. Tsar Alexander marched into Paris after vanquishing Napoleon. Stalin subjugated Eastern Europe and terrorized the planet. Putin’s ethno-messianism however may be putting Russia on the road to oblivion.The Russian high command is exposed as gangsters, racketeers, and yes-men. This is a cabal that with each defeat resembles more and more the cast of psychopaths and dead-enders who stuck it out with Adolf Hitler in the Berlin Bunker. Like Hitler, Putin now seeks refuge with the world’s pariahs—in this case Iran and North Korea. Shockingly for him, China has not come to his rescue, and he has received the back of the hand from the leaders of India and Turkey.Once dismissing Europe as a spent force, Putin’s brutality has rearranged the continent’s map. Russia’s northern forces are now staring directly across at the modern and highly capable armies of Finland and Sweden, whose countries have emerged from a neutral slumber to challenge their ancient enemies. He will have a hard time defending decisions to Russian posterity that led to the revitalization of NATO with Poland now assuming a leadership role once coveted by Germany and reinforced the primacy of the Anglo-American alliance (no matter how indifferent the Biden Administration is to the historic ties between Washington and London as the most reliable lasting bulwark against global tyranny).Karl Marx’s collaborator Friedrich Engels famously called the Russian Empire a ""prison of peoples."" Ronald Reagan pointed to the Soviet Union as ""the focus of evil in the modern world."" If the West stays the course and that is not a given with the Biden administration and an appeasement chorus in Berlin and Paris, Putin’s legacy will be an impoverished third world Russia. It is ironic the imperialist dreams of the small-time policeman might lead to the final death knell of the Russian/Soviet Empire.

Here’s why we are probably entering the ""hottest"" phase of this war.The Kremlin’s biggest fear is the deployment of U.S. and NATO troops into the theater in Ukraine. Moscow military planners have previously concluded that war between Russia and the United States is inevitable, given that the two Cold War adversaries have been in a confrontation for geopolitical control over post-Soviet states since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So, escalation is not an unthinkable option for Putin.Members of the Washington officialdom now openly acknowledge that arming Ukraine is a low-cost way of bleeding Russia of manpower and matériel, arguing that it would prevent a larger European conflict. This justification contradicts the results of several years worth of wargaming conducted by the U.S. government to simulate a direct Russia-NATO kinetic conflict. These table-top military exercises revealed that continued escalation of hostilities in a contested post-Soviet territory eventually drags the U.S. into a broader war, spiraling out of control.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/world/inspired-ukraine-taiwan-seeks-bolster-military-preparedness-china-threat-continues,Eryk Michael Smith,2023-01-09T02:00:36-05:00,"Inspired by Ukraine, Taiwan seeks to bolster military preparedness as China threat continues",Taiwan's president recently announced that mandatory military service was to be raised to 1 year,"KAOHSIUNG CITY, Taiwan — After close to a decade, men over 18 in Taiwan will again be required to serve a full year in the military rather than just four months, a return to a conscription policy that had been in place since 2013. The new requirement will be phased in over the year and will reportedly apply to males born on or after Jan. 1, 2005.Speaking to the nation late last month, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen pointed to Ukraine holding off the might of the Russian military for more than 300 days, something she argued was due in no small part to Ukraine’s readiness. Tsai said Ukraine’s strong resistance capacity had ""bought time"" that allowed the international community to come to its aid. Taiwan’s president said she and her cabinet, as well as military officials, had spent much time debating the issue and that although it was ""a difficult choice,"" expanding the length of conscription was necessary. She also announced that the basic monthly pay for conscripts would jump from around US$212 per month to just under US$662.Russia’s underperformance in the war in Ukraine has been highly instructive and motivating for Taiwan’s civilian and military leaders. But of course, China has also been taking notes as it watches Ukraine — and for Taiwan, the hope is that China is learning one major lesson from Russia’s stumbles: that even a vastly overpowered nation is hard to beat on its home turf, especially if its people are trained and willing to resist.Experts in both Taiwan and the United States, though, have long expressed worries about a seeming complacency in Taiwan regarding defense. Taiwan’s leadership says they are addressing these concerns with more scrutiny of weapons and tactics — and by reinstating a year of conscription.In comments to Fox News Digital, Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow and director of defense strategy at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, notes that an all-volunteer military is a preference, but both here and globally, it’s becoming harder to recruit professional soldiers.""If it’s going to be four months, we might as well not do it at all. So much money was wasted on these few months of training,"" a retired Taiwanese air force captain told Fox News Digital. Choosing to withhold his name, the retired captain said, ""No one wants a war, and I don’t think one is imminent, but if it comes, we need to have soldiers who at least know the basics."" He also compared Taiwan’s military requirements to those in Israel and said a discussion on mandatory training for women could be a good next step.China’s bullying of Taiwan permeates every part of the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, from China blocking Taiwan’s participation in health conferences organized by the United Nations to a simulated naval blockade and live missile tests after former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi defied Beijing and visited Taipei in August 2022.The new conscription policy was met with a predictable mix of emotions and opinions, but somewhat surprisingly, strong opposition has been sparse and the prevailing response — from both sides of Taiwan’s main political divide — has been support for the government’s move. Before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, however, this would likely not have been the case.Ian Easton, author of ""The Chinese Invasion Threat,"" an influential book that examines what a China-Taiwan conflict might look like, told Fox News Digital that he found the change ""remarkable"" and said, ""Only very rarely does a liberal democracy undertake difficult reforms like this in peacetime. Not long ago, the national conscription system was regarded as the third rail of Taiwanese politics: touch it and you die. But now any politician in Taiwan who doesn’t take national security seriously is likely to be in hot water at the polls.""Easton’s observation is illustrated by Enoch Wu, a politician with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Wu, a candidate in a Jan. 8 by-election for a seat in Taiwan’s parliament, made his stance clear in a May 2022 New York Times op-ed, writing, ""We seem to expect American sons and daughters to risk their lives to protect our home, while relieving our own of that very duty."" Tough words, but it’s a sentiment that’s picked up significant traction over the last year.Of course, not everyone in Taiwan is happy about the upcoming change. Some parents and their sons have voiced displeasure and concerns. When Teresa Chen, a coffee shop owner in the southern city of Kaohsiung, heard the news, she and her husband did the math and were relieved that their 21-year-old son would not be affected by the change.""I don’t want him to lose a year, especially as he’s not interested in the military,"" Chen told Fox News Digital.On the other side of the same Taiwanese port city of almost 3 million, another set of parents sighed in resignation — 14-year-old Alen is now set to serve a year, and while neither Alen’s parents nor the junior high schooler are looking forward to it, they all agree there are benefits to military service, from character-building to better physical fitness. Other parents agree. One Taipei father told Fox News Digital he’d rather have his son properly prepared for conflict, which of course he hopes never occurs.A good number of people in Taiwan often argue there’s little point in trying to hold off a full-on invasion from China as it is significantly stronger by almost every military standard, but experts such as Michael Turton, a long-term Taiwan-based writer, blogger and advocate for keeping the island’s democracy free from interference from Beijing, says this kind of ""defeatist"" attitude is due in no small part to Chinese propaganda.""A hidden factor is that every male [now] experiences a program of conscription that is obviously ineffective in producing a useful military response … so it [the defeatist propaganda] does have some effect,"" says Turton.Kitsch Liao, assistant director of Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told Fox News Digital that the same ""defeatist"" attitude is sometimes expressed in uninformed comments by some in Taiwan about the ""low quality"" and ""ineffectiveness"" of weapons being sold to Taiwan by the United States.As in South Korea, Taiwan wrestles with concerns that mandatory time in the military could mean delayed careers and disrupted lives for its young men, but most seem to agree these concerns are dwarfed by the existential threat posed by Beijing.Whether the United States should or would send more trainers or engage in joint patrols with Taiwan is up for debate, but most Taiwanese seem to be closing ranks and agreeing that, at the very least, men of fighting age should be trained well enough to offer a genuine resistance to a potential Chinese invasion. Local news reported that by 2024, conscripts in Taiwan will undergo a longer boot camp, fire significantly more live rounds and be trained to fire powerful weapons, such as the U.S. Javelin and Stinger missiles."

It's primarily designed for reconnaissance missions and has enough armor to protect against light infantry weapons, according to the French defense ministry. They have wheels rather than tracks, allowing it to be more mobile than heavy tanks.Ukraine has for months sought to be supplied with heavier tanks, including the U.S. Abrams and the German Leopard 2 tanks.The Czech Republic and Poland have provided Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukrainian forces.France's decision was announced after an hour-long call between French President Emmanuel Macron and Zelenskyy Wednesday afternoon. The Elysee declined to provide details about the agreement.The AMX-10 RC has been in service with the French military since 1981 and has undergone recent upgrades. France's defense ministry said the combat vehicle is now being gradually replaced by the new equivalent named Jaguar.The decision is another in France's military support to Ukraine, following the French defense minister's visit to Kyiv last week.Paris has supplied Ukraine with a substantial chunk of its arsenal of Caesar cannons, as well as anti-tank missiles, Crotale air defense missile batteries and rocket launchers. It is also training some 2,000 Ukrainian troops on French soil.U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration is considering sending to Ukraine Bradley Fighting Vehicles, a medium armored combat vehicle that can serve as a troop carrier.Biden was asked during an exchange with reporters while traveling in Kentucky whether providing the tracked armored fighting vehicle to Ukraine was on the table. He responded ""yes,"" without offering further comment.The German government has for months faced calls from Kyiv and some lawmakers at home to deliver Leopard 2 heavy tanks to Ukraine, but has said that it wouldn’t go alone with such a move and that no other country has supplied similar Western equipment.The co-leader of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, Saskia Esken, told n-tv television Thursday that Scholz and the government are in regular and close contact ""with our partners, with our friends, of course particularly with the Americans"" on weapons deliveries.Britain says it has given Ukraine more than 200 armored vehicles for troop transport, but no tanks as of yet."

Ethnic Serbs had set up barricades at the border to protest the arrest of an ex-policeman suspected of being involved in attacks against ethnic Albanian police officers, France 24 reported.""Such an illegal blockade has prevented the free movement and circulation of people and goods, therefore we invite our citizens and compatriots to use other border points for circulation,"" Kosovo police said in a statement.Several shooting incidents followed, with attacks on Kosovar police and international peacekeepers. Serbian armed forces went on heightened alert, but Vucic appeared to ease tensions after reaching an agreement on Dec. 29 that would see the blockade removed, the BBC reported.Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, Russian ambassador to Serbia, said Serbia may rely on Russia regarding the Kosovo situation, ""regardless of the serious challenges … in the context of the confrontation with NATO,"" according to Russian news agency TASS.Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, but Serbia has never recognized it and has actively encouraged the country’s ethnic Serbian population to defy Kosovar authority.This potentially chaotic situation presented a prime opportunity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who treats Serbia as a ""very close ally,"" according to Stradner.""[Serbia] does not border Russia, but in every possible sense they are supporting Russia when it comes to the war in Ukraine,"" she said, adding that the Russian ambassador ""received extra instructions from Moscow on how to proceed"" on the issue.Despite the removal of the blockade, Anonymous called out Vucic and accused him of prompting the blockade at Putin's request, eventually declaring war on Vucic.In the first week of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia attacked Ukraine's government websites. The use of cyberattacks prompted Anonymous to declare war on Russia and start targeting Russian websites and commence a series of ""hack and dump"" attacks.The large impact of the attacks has seen a large volume of information dumped out in public, including the release of 120,000 Russian soldiers’ personal details, access to the Kremlin’s CCTV system, and also gas pipelines out of Russia, according to the AnonymousTV Twitter account (it should be noted that Anonymous, by nature, has no single ""official"" account).The group fired back, saying, ""#Anonymous is not a small group of powerless people to ignore, we are an organized, globally active, collective of like-minded individuals and our message will be clear, if you don't stop your dangerous actions in #Kosovo,"" a post on AnonymousTV’s Twitter read.Dustin Carmack, a research fellow for cybersecurity, intelligence and emerging technologies at the Heritage Foundation, cautioned that while such revelations may have good intentions, it’s hard to predict the knock-on effects.""You saw that throughout different intelligence revelations over the last decade and the impacts that can have in Europe and other places,"" Carmack told Fox News Digital.""You don’t know what the final tie-in for that person is who makes that decision, and that makes it very difficult for the Brits or Americans or anybody,"" he added.Fox News Digital sent requests for comment to the Serbian foreign ministry and the U.S. State Department."

If any movement to turn Berlin against Kyiv were to succeed, it would deal a critical blow to a country that has depended on Western military assistance to survive under an onslaught of Russian forces.Germany has sent over 1 billion euros in humanitarian aid, military equipment and advanced air defense systems to Ukraine since the war began, and polls show the majority of Germans still support Ukraine. But the polling also indicated support for German military support for Ukraine may be waning as Berlin attempts to tackle the steep rise in energy costs facing its citizens.Germany also represents a unique opportunity for Putin to turn Europe against Ukraine, with the country sharing deep historical and cultural roots and a population of several million Russian speakers.The story comes after authorities in Germany last month foiled a coup attempt by far-right members of the Reichsbürger movement, with the government saying the ""domestic terrorist organization"" planned to overthrow the German government and install a ""prince"" related to the former German royal family.According to Koffler, Russia's experience in East Germany also gives the Kremlin a leg up on running such a campaign.As the war nears its second year, Ukraine will continue to depend on the support of a united Europe and the U.S. But as energy costs continue to rise, the pro-Putin movement within Germany threatens to capitalize on the economic situation and push Berlin away from Kyiv.According to Koffler, the groundwork for such a success was laid by Moscow long ago."

Russia followed up its holiday missile attack with drones that flew into the city just after midnight on Monday morning. Air-raid sirens blared and at least two explosions were heard in the heart of Kyiv, according to The New York Times.Russia has made relentless use of the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones since the fall. The drones have an extensive range and explode on impact.Ukrainian air defenses routinely shoot down most of the drones on approach to their targets, the sheer volume of strikes allows some to detonate.Ukraine largely uses U.S.-supplied anti-air defenses to protect its major cities. The U.S. has granted tens of billions of dollars in military aid to the country.The flow of weapons has put a strain on U.S. stockpiles, and Congress passed a massive budget granting the Pentagon nearly $900 billion to refit.The traditional measure of U.S. military readiness has been its capacity to supply and carry out two major conflicts in separate areas of the globe. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued in December that U.S. support for Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in that readiness.The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since February, and there are plans to send much more. The aid is such that President Biden's administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used. The volume of U.S. aid to the country has given rise to some skeptics within the Republican Party, who are calling for greater accountability.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

In other words, the return on our investment in Ukraine will be more pitches for more investments in Ukraine. Give me money so I can demand more money. That's what Zelenskyy promised us last night.But unfortunately, this is not one of those times. The United States is flat out of money and not just in some abstract PowerPoint presentation kind of way, where we show you graphs of the national debt and we all pretend to be shocked and horrified. No, no, no. The United States is broke in a real way, meaning we can no longer afford to take care of our citizens.How high is it? Well, over the last three years since COVID began, the federal government spent about $100 billion in extra Medicaid payments to Americans. That's a lot of money. How much is it? Well, it turns out that $100 billion is roughly what Congress has sent to our fast-talking Ukrainian friend in the sweatshirt in less than a single year. Just for comparison, just you would know what the priorities are in Washington, your health care is just too expensive. Sorry. And your border is too. Can't afford it. But for the strongman who runs Ukraine, no cost is too high.VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.NBC News took off right after them. That was the headline for NBC. Its house ""historian"" Michael Beschloss declared this: ""For any members of Congress who refuse to clap for Zelenskyy, we need to know from them exactly why. We need to know why."" Thought crime alert. You've been reported as not applauding. Explain yourself, pleb. And then Beschloss went on television to drive home the point. Our sources have reported you are not clapping. Watch this.Why wouldn't you clap for a man who banned a Christian denomination? A man who arrested priests, raided monasteries, seized churches outlawed opposition media outlets, outlawed political parties that opposed him, threw his primary political opponent in jail. Why would you applaud for a man like that? Do you love Putin? Are you opposed to democracy? Explain yourself. That's what he's saying. That's what they're all saying.Remember when Joe Biden told us about Nord Stream? There were two stories. The first story was Joe Biden promised to blow up Nord Stream, the pipeline that brought natural gas from Russia to Western Europe. He's going to blow it up. Do you remember that? You're not allowed to remember it, but we remember it. And we saved the tape. Here it is.PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine, again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream tube. We will bring an end to it.REPORTER: But how will you do that exactly? Since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control.JOE BIDEN: We will. I promise you. We'll be able to do it.Foreign Policy Magazine, which used to be a real magazine, called any questions about what happened to Nord Stream a ""Kremlin talking point."" Wow. Could it be they were lying? Oh, yeah, they were lying. Oh, they were lying.So if Russia didn't do it, then the people who suggested maybe the Biden people were behind it were 100% right. So you'd think in a free country, in a democracy, you would get to discuss that in public. But you can't. And the press corps is not going to help you. They don't ask questions. We don't have that anymore. Here's what we have.JOHN BERMAN: Politicians and the press often toss around comparisons to Winston Churchill. But this time, minus the cigar and the whiskey, it fits.ANA CABRERA: President Biden face-to-face with the man who has drawn comparisons to Winston Churchill.ANDREA MITCHELL: And in a dramatic wartime appearance reminiscent of Winston Churchill in World War II.HILLARY CLINTON: This was historic. Some people have compared it to when Churchill came.JON MEACHAM: Zelenskyy is very much acting in the Churchillian tradition.JONATHAN LEMIER: What could be a Churchillian moment.JOHN SPENCER: I mean, he is a modern Winston Churchill with an iPhone.SEN. JACK REED: Someone who probably is the most courageous and inspirational leader since Winston Churchill.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: Where Winston Churchill stood generations ago, so to President Zelenskyy stands.MARGARET HOOVER: That's exactly what I'm saying.GEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY: This is a historical figure. This guy actually can be compared to Winston Churchill, to Lincoln in 1860.Alright. So this is clearly some sort of weird psychodrama that a ruling class is engaging in that gives meaning to their otherwise barren lives. The problem is there are potential consequences that could end the world. So the other day, Lindsey Graham came out, the Republican from South Carolina, and said that he agreed with Joe Biden and Zelenskyy. The real goal is not to move Russian troops out of Ukraine, back to pre-February borders. The real goal is regime change in Russia. Watch this.LINDSEY GRAHAM: How does this war end? When Russia breaks and they take Putin out. Anything short of that, the war is going to continue. To ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. To signal a cease fire, Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again. So we're in it to win it. And the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out.Take out Putin. Putin's bad. Kill him. Fine. What happens then? Well, the world's largest landmass falls into ungovernable chaos. And that country has the world's largest nuclear arsenal. What happens to all those weapons? In a country with a lot of people who hate us. Lindsey Graham has no idea. He doesn't care. He's not interested. He's not going to be here to find out.And you know what they don't care about? You, your health care, your southern border, your children, your schools, your country. They don't care."

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/world/frozen-conflict-look-back-2022s-key-moments-ukraines-fight-russia,Michael Lee,2022-12-22T12:00:54-05:00,'Frozen Conflict': A look back at 2022's key moments in Ukraine's fight with Russia,The stalemate between Ukraine and Russia is likely to continue into 2023,"While much of the world celebrates Christmas and rings in a new year, Ukrainians will be marking the passing the grim milestone of having reached the 10-month mark in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Koffler's comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine is set to hit the 10-month mark and promises to spill over well into 2023, a sort of stalemate many analysts failed to see coming when Russian forces crossed the border and spilled into Ukraine.Expectations of a swift victory were likely shared by Russian President Vladimir Putin when he launched what he coined a ""special military operation in Ukraine"" on Feb. 24, a plan designed to bring a quick win that would usher in a new phase of Russian dominance in the region.""Putin expected to subdue Ukraine within days, maximum weeks, force [Ukranian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to capitulate or flee and install a new government that is pro-Russian, or at minimum not pro-Western — a new regime that would abandon plans to join NATO,"" Koffler said.However, such a quick victory for Putin has failed to materialize, setting the stage for a continuation of the war into 2023. As the world waits to see how the war unfolds in the new year, here is a look back at some of the key moments of the conflict in 2022.As the world celebrated the calendar flipping to 2022, Russia was continuing its months-long build up of forces in Ukraine. By January, military analysts in Ukraine were estimating that Russia had amassed a force of close to 100,000 troops on the border, having ended the year by pushing for a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, a proposal that was rejected by both Ukraine and members of the alliance.Russian troops began spilling into allied Belarus, also on the border of Ukraine, to conduct military exercises. The continued build up sparked international condemnation from the West, with the U.S. sending $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine and President Biden warning of consequences for Russia in the event of an invasion.""Russia will be held accountable if it invades,"" Biden said in a January press conference.However, Russia's military buildup continued, reaching nearly 200,000 troops at Ukraine's border as the eventual invasion neared.""Russia accumulated, over the course of approximately two months, a build up of 190 000 troops, including military hardware, logistics, supplies,"" Koffler said.On Feb. 21, Putin announced Russian recognition of two eastern Ukrainian breakaway regions in Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The move brought the first round of NATO sanctions against Russia and growing concern that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent.Undeterred by Western threats, Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine three days later and sent in many of his troops on a mission for the ""demilitarisation and denazification"" of Ukraine.Within minutes of Putin's announced invasion, explosions could be heard in major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa. Reports quickly circulated that Russian troops had landed in the crucial coastal city of Mariupol, while observers closely followed large units of Russian forces making a beeline for the capital.Heavy fighting broke out across the country and eventually spilled into Kyiv, while the Russian air force continued its bombardment of major cities and key infrastructure across the country. Many analysts expected the outmatched Ukrainian military to quickly fold under the pressure, but the country's resistance to the invasion proved more fierce than what had been predicted.Billions worth of Western money and weapons continued to flow into Ukraine, giving their seemingly outmatched forces a chance to fend off the offensive. By April, Russian forces in the north began a retreat and reorganization of forces, while Ukraine maintained control of its capital.Having failed to quickly end the war, Russia reorganized its forces and shifted its focus to the southern and eastern portions of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were put on the defensive across multiple fronts as the Russians secured key cities and infrastructure and amassed heavy forces with an eye towards maintaining an occupation of areas in Kherson and Donbas.Heavy fighting continued in the east and south throughout the spring and deep into the summer, while Putin shifted gears toward targeting critical infrastructure in a bid to weaken the will of Ukraine's civilian population.""Moscow also launched ‘Strategic Operation to Defeat Critical Infrastructure of the Adversary,’ a war fighting doctrine, developed on Putin’s orders a decade ago as part of the plan to restore control over post-Soviet states, which Russia views as part or its strategic security perimeter - Putin’s version of the Monroe Doctrine,"" Koffler said.The cooperation in Ukraine has seemingly deepened ties between Iran and Russia, with Tehran going so far as to send military advisers to Crimea to train Russian forces on the use of the UAVs.However, bolstered by continued U.S. and allied security assistance, Ukraine showed little sign that it was willing to give up on the regions, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowing to retake the territories currently occupied by Russian forces, including the long-held Crimean Peninsula.""Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up,"" Zelenskyy said during an August address.Zelenskyy showed he intended to make good on that promise by the end of August, launching a Ukrainian counteroffensive that suddenly put Russian forces on the defensive for the first time in months.Ukrainian forces attacked long-held Russian positions across the south and eastern regions of Ukraine with fierce flighting that eventually led to Ukraine regaining control of large areas it had lost in the months before.""Zelenskyy mounted a blistering counter-offensive, in which Ukrainian forces recaptured approximately 5% of the 20% of Ukraine’s territory occupied by the Russians,"" Koffler said.The offensive also worked to reignite international support for Ukraine, ushering in a renewed round of security assistance to assist Ukrainian forces in maintaining the offensive.""He continued to galvanize the West to help his country defeat the Russian occupiers,"" Koffler said of the Ukrainian leader.The Ukrainians had also once again dealt a large blow to Putin's war plan, forcing the Russian leader to bring more new troops to the fight as heavy Russian casualties mounted.""Putin drafted an additional 318,000 troops, having invoked a partial mobilization, the first since World War II,"" Koffler said.The offensive also forced Putin to admit that the conflict could be a protracted one, which would require the government to increase its funding for the effort.Meanwhile, crippling international sanctions proved to be an obstacle to Russia's aims, limiting Putin's ability to resupply his forces with gear and munitions while applying pressure on him politically.As Zelenskyy made his historic trip to the White House to meet with Biden this week, the future of the war in Ukraine remains as uncertain as ever. While the Ukrainian leader appealed for greater assistance, the U.S. is seeking to balance its continued support with Ukraine while attempting to avoid risking further escalation with Putin.Zelenskyy's trip came as Biden announced an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance in Ukraine, which will for the first time will include Patriot missile systems Kyiv has long coveted. It also comes as Congress appears poised to sign off on an additional $45 billion in aid for Ukraine, a development Koffler believes will make it hard for Russia to achieve its war aims.During Zelenskyy's address to a joint meeting of Congress Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader stressed the importance of supporting Ukraine now, arguing that Russia's aggression could eventually threaten NATO allies or even the U.S. homeland.He also pointed to Russia's renewed partnership with Iran, warning the two ""terrorist"" countries cooperation threatens the rest of the world.However, Koffler noted that despite Russia's view that Ukraine is a critical buffer between itself and NATO, a path to victory for Russia will also remain elusive.Koffler also expressed pessimism at the chances the sides could reach a diplomatic solution to end the conflict, arguing that the terms of such a solution would likely be unacceptable to both sides.""This is rapidly turning into Afghanistan 2.0,"" Koffler said. ""My assessment is that 2-5 years from now, there will still be fighting on the ground in Ukraine. Even if some sort of a deal is brokered eventually — which I see no chance of right now — it will not bring ultimate peace because neither side trusts the other."

His country is being devastated and his people are dying by the thousands under Russia’s relentless assault. And Zelenskyy believes that additional billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars will help him expel the Russians and secure victory. He believes he is justified in using every possible tool in his toolbox, including his talents as a performer.Zelenskyy thanked Congress and the American people for the ""invaluable assistance,"" having expressed hope that his ""words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart."" He spoke accented but very comprehensible English, using forceful language and a somber tone as he was reading from his notes, frequently looking up to connect with his audience and sometimes placing his hand on his heart to express gratitude. He periodically raised his voice and tapped the podium with his fist for emphasis. He wore his signature olive-color crew-neck military style sweater, cargo pants, and heavy boots, maintaining his image of a wartime president.While Putin does seek to re-establish control over post-Soviet states, which Moscow views as its security perimeter and its version of the U.S. Monroe Doctrine, he has no designs on any NATO countries, including the former Soviet Baltic States. The claim by Washington and Kyiv politicians that Russia would attack a NATO country – which would trigger the collective defense clause – is nonsensical. The Russian army is struggling to secure a clear military victory over a much smaller opponent, having exhibited incredible tactical incompetence in this war. How on earth would it go against a NATO nation or even Sweden or Finland? Putin is not suicidal.We learned in Afghanistan that even for the Taliban, which lacks a regular military, it doesn’t take much to keep a low-intensity conflict going indefinitely. It took Washington ""experts"" 20 years to absorb that reality and it cost American taxpayers $2.2 trillion and 6,000 lives. Putin’s military, as tactically inept as it is, is still the top dog in the region. As long as Russia keeps gradually dismantling Ukraine, Putin has achieved his ultimate goal – prevent Ukraine’s NATO membership. Russia’s definition of victory is denying victory to Kyiv and Washington.The charismatic Ukrainian Churchill in a T-shirt mentioned former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, gifted a Ukrainian flag that he brought from the battlefield, and gave Nancy Pelosi a big kiss at the end of his speech. ""Providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority,"" declared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., before Zelenskyy’s address. The message to Americans delivered by the Washington establishment and Kyiv on Wednesday was clear – Ukraine’s priorities equal America’s.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

Churchill famously acknowledged, ""No lover ever studied every whim of his mistress as I did those of President Roosevelt."" Likewise, Zelenskyy's mission was to get inside the minds and hearts of Americans and to woo its leaders, hoping for an enduring unity and continued support.In the scope of history, the appeals for help from both Churchill and Zelenskyy strike a chord that runs deep, reminding us of our status as the first great democracy that other seek to emulate.Bret Baier is the Chief Political Anchor of Fox News Channel, and the Anchor and Executive Editor of ""Special Report with Bret Baier.""

And he made a direct appeal for more U.S. military aid.Zelenskyy's address came as Congress is slated to pass a $1.7 trillion spending bill this week.

They've argued that sending more aid without proper accountability metrics in place or a plan for ending the war is improper.""Most of my constituents do not wish to have their money sent to Ukraine, especially not without oversight or an audit,"" said Rep.

He visited his operation headquarters on Friday to sound out military commanders.His trip for talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was his first to Minsk since 2019 - before the COVID pandemic and a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2020 that Lukashenko crushed with strong support from the Kremlin.Russian forces used Belarus as a launch pad for their abortive attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in February, and there has been Russian and Belarusian military activity there for months.Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring.Moscow and Minsk have set up a joint military unit in Belarus and held numerous exercises. Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week.But Lukashenko, a pariah in the West who relies heavily on Moscow for support, has repeatedly said Belarus will not enter the war in Ukraine. Foreign diplomats say committing Belarusian troops would be deeply unpopular at home.Already, Western sanctions have made it hard for Belarus to ship potash fertilizers, its top export, via Baltic ports.Western military analysts say Lukashenko's small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference - but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere.Putin's visit was announced on Friday after a surprise Dec. 3 trip to Belarus by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, where he signed an agreement with his Belarusian counterpart whose details were not disclosed.Adding to the ominous mood music, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, one of the few officials in Lukashenko's government with any rapport with the West, died suddenly last month. No official cause of death was announced.His successor, Sergei Aleinik, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday.Lukashenko said he and Putin would discuss a long-running effort to integrate their respective former Soviet republics in a supranational Union State. The talks are seen by the Belarus opposition as a vehicle for a creeping Russian annexation.Belarus's state news agency, BelTA, said they would answer questions from reporters after their talks.At a government meeting after the talks with Putin were announced, Lukashenko unexpectedly said that any ceding of sovereignty would be a betrayal of the Belarusian people.""Particularly after these large-scale negotiations, everyone will say: 'That's it, there are no longer any authorities in Belarus, the Russians are already walking around and running the country',"" Lukashenko said.He said he would discuss economic cooperation, energy supplies, defense and security with Putin."

Spoehr,2022-12-19T10:00:31-05:00,"Defense bill not perfect, but should result in stronger, more effective US military",The NDAA is a clear win for those who support a strong US military,"Having passed both chambers of Congress by wide margins, the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is now headed to the president. Though delayed through mis-prioritization of the legislative process, the final bill accomplishes its most important task: authorizing funding and providing a policy framework to strengthen the nation’s defenses.Also included is a provision lifting the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for service members. With military recruiting falling well short of its targets, it is hard to argue the wisdom of separating service members or denying enlistment to volunteers for declining to take the vaccine. The recruiting crisis led the NDAA to shrink the Army’s end strength by 33,000 soldiers from its 2022 authorized level.One item added to the bill was the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act. This will serve to enhance U.S.–Taiwanese relations in the face of Chinese adventurism. It authorizes $10 billion over five years to strengthen security cooperation, makes Taiwan eligible for a regional contingency munition stockpile, combats Chinese coercive activities, advocates Taiwan’s participation in international organizations, and supports stronger economic and cultural ties. Appropriators must now fund the program, but this is a necessary first step.Finally, the NDAA includes increased accountability for Ukraine aid. Prior U.S. aid packages to Ukraine had extensive accountability and reporting requirements, but the NDAA builds upon that by requiring the Defense Department, State Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to develop a framework—reviewable by Congress—for conducting comprehensive reviews and audits of all assistance they provide to Ukraine.The bill is not perfect. Some provisions unrelated to national defense remain. But lawmakers should be congratulated on narrowing the bill to mostly focus on enhancing warfighting capabilities. The net result should be a stronger, more effective U.S. military.Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Spoehr is the director of The Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense."

Putin suffered severe territorial losses this fall, with Ukraine retaking much of the ground it had lost to invasion, but the ground war now sits in stalemate.Ptuin's new strategy has been to target Ukraine's infrastructure, knocking out power and water facilities ahead of Ukraine's brutal winter.A major missile attack struck three separate Ukrainian cities on Friday, the capital of Kyiv, southern Kryvyi Rih and northeastern Kharkiv. The bombardment targeted the cities' energy supplies.Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said his city was without electricity in the aftermath of the attack, while Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Syniehubov announced three strikes on critical infrastructure.While Ukraine has been somewhat successful in knocking out missiles and drones while still in the air, the volume of Russian attacks has typically overwhelmed Ukraine's defenses, allowing attacks to slip through.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

FoxNews,UnitedStates,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putins-fashion-faux-pas-russian-military-uniforms-unsuitable-combat-brutal-winter-fight,Rebekah Koffler,2022-12-19T04:00:06-05:00,Putin's fashion faux pas: Russian military uniforms unsuitable for combat in brutal winter fight,Uniforms are based more on style than combat suitability,"The temperature in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, recently dropped to 25 degrees and Ukrainians are freezing as Russian airstrikes are pounding the country’s vital infrastructure, cutting off electricity and heat and depriving them of drinking water.But ""General Frost,"" on which the Russians have relied for centuries to help defeat the country’s enemies, has also turned its weapon against President Vladimir Putin’s soldiers. The Russian forces, who have been fighting, on Putin’s orders, against their Slavic brethren for 10 months, are reportedly dying from hypothermia because their uniform no longer holds up to severe Eurasian winters.The fiasco stems from several odd decisions made by the post-Soviet military leadership and by Putin himself.The Soviet Red Army uniform was a poor man’s version of the Imperial Russian Army dress from the 19th century. In the run-up to World War II, when Russia had the largest army in Europe, approximately 2 million soldiers, Moscow prioritized low-cost but effective couture, compared to the pompous, flashy designs favored by the czarist generals. The uniform was practical, with no frills other than a bright distinctive insignia worn by senior officers that made them easy targets for German marksmen.The winter wear included a greatcoat or half-length fur coat, a cap with ear flaps and thick felt wool valenki footwear worn by the Russian military and civilians alike for hundreds of years. Designed for extreme Russian winters, the uniforms helped the Russians forces beat the French in 1812 and the Germans in 1941-1945. Napoleon Bonaparte admitted that the Russian winter was largely responsible for the disintegration of his army. Many of Hitler’s lightly clad Nazi troops also froze to death.An exception was the officer field cap that proudly sported a new Russian national symbol, the double-headed eagle, which the soldiers dubbed ""mutated chicken."" Igor Sergeyev, who rose to defense minister in 1997 under Yeltsin but was fired by Putin in 2001, made Russian military dress look like that of the U.S. Army. And Anatoliy Serdyukov, who was also fired by Putin, ordered winter uniforms to be slim and tailored.But the biggest uproar in the ranks erupted after the radical changes made by a famous fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin. Known for his theatrical styles, Yudashkin’s evening gowns are displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the California Museum of Fashion in Los Angeles and the Museum of Fashion and Textile in Paris.Service members complained that the uniform was made of cheap synthetic material, making them too hot in summer. Its pockets were too small and didn’t fit a mobile phone or identification papers and other documents. Velcro patches fell off, buttons disappeared within two weeks, stitching came apart, and color faded after a couple of washes. The uniform was also inappropriate for combat because it made a rustling sound with movement and melted in fire.Most importantly, the ""designer"" uniform was also too flimsy for Russian winters, because instead of natural textiles, like cotton, linen and wool, it was made of new high-tech materials. The Russian soldiers joked that at minus 15 Celsius they started jumping up and down to keep warm, and at minus 20, they couldn’t wait for the enemy to shoot them to spare them from freezing to death. Putin’s current defense minister banned Yudashkin’s invention the minute he assumed his post in 2012, prompting the famed fashionista to blame the Russian military authorities for ""playing Dolce & Gabbana"" rather than following his design recommendations.Current Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made a series of his own innovations. Since Shoigu has no military experience himself, he didn’t want to visually appear as being outranked by his army men. Shoigu introduced the limit to the number of medals worn on the ceremonial military dress to 10, allowing only those earned in combat. Until then, Russian servicemen participating in military parades on Red Square decorated themselves with several dozen medals arranged in four or five rows that didn’t fit on their chests, many of them civilian and, therefore, meaningless.The most radical change to the Russian uniform was introduced by Putin himself. In September 2020, by presidential decree, Putin banned the famous Russian military papakha headdress, which was worn by Russian, and previously Soviet, generals and high-ranking offices.Made of the fur, skinned from 3-day-old baby lambs of a special breed called Karakul, these hats kept the Russian generals warm because the fur bristles were thick, densely set and water-repellant. But Putin and Shoigu chose to replace the $317 papakhas with much less costly $79 caps made of rabbit fur.With the vain Russian military brass having prioritized style and copying the West over functionality in the post-Soviet uniform, it is hardly surprising that their forces are shivering to death as winter sets in on the battlefield.While the troops look dapper during the famous Russian military parades, pleasing Putin and his lieutenants, they are making good-looking corpses, too.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

If passed, the money will go toward purchasing missiles for the Army, new weapons systems for the Navy and expanding ammunition plants, among other things, the New York Times reported Sunday.The traditional measure of U.S. military readiness has been its capacity to supply and carry out two major conflicts in separate areas of the globe. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued last week that U.S. support for Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in that readiness.China's recent aggression toward Taiwan has also contributed to calls for more spending. Aid to the self-governed island has already been delayed, thanks in large part to the flow of weapons to Ukraine.The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since February, so much that President Biden's administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used. The volume of U.S. aid to the country has given rise to some skeptics within the Republican Party, who are calling for greater accountability.Nevertheless, funding conflicts with near-peer rivals is far more expensive than the asymmetric warfare the U.S. military has largely engaged in this century.The potential $858 billion budget would represent a 4.3% annual increase over the past two years, according to NYT.And the U.S. isn't the only one. Allies like Japan have also announced ramped-up military spending in the face of growing Chinese aggression.

That reconstruction, however, is a way off. There is no point rebuilding what may be bombed again. As long as the war rages, talk of reconstructing Ukraine seems somewhat theoretical. But arming it is urgent business if Kyiv is to continue to claw back territory lost and defend itself. Bill Browder thinks Russia needs to pick up that tab, too.As such, Browder considers the idea of having frozen Russian Central Bank assets go to arms for Ukraine an ""elegant"" solution to the cost of conflict crisis, and he’s on a mission to make it happen. Aid to Ukraine has become a political football in Washington, as another disputed budget deadline looms amidst fears of a possible government shutdown before year-end. Republicans want President Biden to stop writing ""blank checks"" and have been crying out for greater oversight of the money spent on Kyiv. Some would like to see those dollars instead spent on America’s southern border. Browder says any drag on Ukraine’s military momentum now—any clipping of its wings—would be catastrophic.Laws on sovereign immunity stand in the way of diverting frozen Russian Central Bank funds to arms for Ukraine. Money that belongs to governments can’t just be expropriated. Browder argues that is surmountable. Laws, he believes, can be changed, especially when arguments about ""breaking legal precedent"" ring increasingly hollow.Browder said he’s suggesting to different lawmakers around the world that in specific and unique circumstances, such as ""when a country invades its neighbor unprovoked, if they’re involved in genocide and various other horrible crimes"" sovereign immunity shouldn’t apply.Browder has some experience working the powers of persuasion when it comes to forcing justice to be served.  When Moscow wouldn’t press charges for the death—many say murder—of his accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison—Browder drew up a list of those he deemed responsible for the death and after a long lobbying effort, got them punished."

Beloved Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed in the attack. Hall spoke remotely during an acceptance speech upon being awarded a 2022 Foreign Press Award from The Association of Foreign Press Correspondents at the Roosevelt House in New York.Hall said ""only then perhaps can good things, can change come from it,"" and praised the people who have helped his recovery.FOX News Media President Jay Wallace accepted the award on the reporter's behalf with a speech that paid tribute to Hall, Zakrzewski, Kuvshynova and everyone who helped ensure Hall made it home.""Ben, he makes it look so effortless.

To extract Hall from the combat zone, the group worked with the Pentagon and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, along with the Polish and Ukrainian militaries. The effort on the ground was led by a ""special operations and intelligence veteran,"" the group revealed, as the team made sure Hall was stabilized and overseen by military medical personnel during the transport. Wallace thanked Austin, the government and other news organizations who also provided support along the way.""We were in contact with the State Department and the DOD. There was nothing the United States could do that day. They said, until you can get him to Poland, there is nothing we can do.

The increase in optimism comes from both Democrats (+11 points since December 2021) and Republicans (+13 points). Still, Democrats (71%) are considerably more optimistic than Republicans (42%) and independents (40%).That’s according to the latest Fox News national survey of registered voters, released Wednesday.Despite this increased optimism, just 31% are satisfied with the way things are going in the country today, while 68% are dissatisfied. A majority of Democrats (58%) are satisfied, compared to just 11% of Republicans.Eight-in-ten voters (81%) give the economy a negative rating, with nearly half (49%) saying economic conditions are downright poor.Three-quarters (74%) report inflation causing them financial hardship over the last six months — an increase over the 67% who felt that way a year ago — and 58% rate their personal economic situation negatively.Voters don’t see relief on the horizon, with just 25% expecting the economy to turn the corner next year and nearly twice as many (48%) thinking it will get worse.On a personal level, nearly half (46%) say they have been hurt by the economic policies of the Biden administration, while just 16% believe they have been helped; another 35% say the policies don’t make a difference. A year ago, the numbers stood at 38% hurt, 17% helped and 43% no difference.Inflation is President Biden's worst issue: 30% approve of the job he is doing (67% disapprove). His ratings on China (33% approve), immigration (35%), the economy (36%) and guns (36%) are not much better.Four-in-ten approve of the job he is doing on energy policy (40%) and the war in Ukraine (42%).Overall, 44% approve of the job Biden is doing, while 56% disapprove. That is slightly worse than last year at this time, when 47% approved and 51% disapproved.Biden is not the only one with an approval issue. Just 27% of voters approve of the job Congress is doing, while 67% disapprove.By a 52-41 percent margin, voters say Biden exceeded his Constitutional authority when he canceled student loan debt worth an estimated $400 billion dollars over 30 years. Those most likely to say he exceeded his authority include Republicans (81%) and those over age 65 (59%). Democrats (72%) and voters under age 45 (56%) are the most likely to think Biden was within his authority. Independents are 16 points more likely to say the president exceeded his authority than stayed within his limits (54% exceeded vs. 38% within his authority).Voters are most likely to attribute rising crime rates across the country to a breakdown of moral values (21%) and the availability of guns (17%). Fewer blame weaker criminal penalties (14%), mental health issues (12%), decreased police funding (9%), a lack of jobs (9%), illegal immigration (8%) or the pandemic (7%).  Democrats believe the availability of guns is the top reason for rising crime (30%), while Republicans think it is a breakdown of moral values (24%).Forty-five percent of voters now believe coronavirus is completely or mostly under control in the U.S., while 54% say it is only somewhat or not at all under control.  This is a markedly improved outlook from last December, when just 27% thought it was completely or mostly under control."

Murekezi had remained in Russian-controlled territory prior to the exchange, ABC News reported.Murekezi spoke of his treatment in a Russian ""torture chamber,"" where he stayed for some weeks earlier in the war, subjected to electric shocks in a basement while soldiers accused him of being a CIA operative and participating in pro-Ukrainian protests.

The Patriot system has a range of up to 100 miles, according to some reporting.Russia on Wednesday apparently responded to reports that the U.S. would be announcing the deployment of the advanced missile system imminently and claimed it would become a legitimate target for Russian strikes in Ukraine, according to a Bloomberg reporter – though this warning doesn't appear to change Moscow's operational standing.Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news."

Sentiment against Putin's invasion of Ukraine has also grown steadily within Russia throughout the conflict.Putin kicked off his invasion of Ukraine in February and initially made significant progress. Ukrainian forces, bolstered by tens of billions in funding from the U.S. and allies, stalled the invasion and successfully took back thousands of square miles of occupied territory this fall.Putin mobilized 300,000 military reservists in September, a move that triggered a wave of military-age men to flee the country out of fear of a general draft. The infusion of fresh troops does not appear to have had much impact on the front lines, however.As a result, Putin's strategy has largely shifted away from land grabs. Putin's military has rained down missiles and shells onto Ukraine's energy and water infrastructure since the late fall. Now many Ukrainian citizens are facing the country's bitter winter with unreliable access to power and other necessities.President Biden's administration announced an additional $53 billion in aid to assist the country in fixing its power grid and water infrastructure in late November.In total, the U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February.The Biden administration is already struggling to track those funds, as Republicans warn of impending audits once they take control of the House in January.Likely future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said his party will not be giving Ukraine a ""blank check"" to fend off Russia's invasion. A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands. The Biden administration's previous tracking efforts have inspected only a fraction of the aid provided to the country.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

And what about the US?,"The Pentagon has used up, in 10 months of the war, 13 years worth of Stinger production and five years worth of Javelin production, according to Raytheon’s CEO. U.S. defense industry production capacity to restock those inventories is extremely limited. U.S. security aid in November reached $68 billion, and the Biden administration has asked Congress for another $37.7 billion.But the probability of a peace settlement remains extremely low. Moscow, Kyiv and Washington — the key stakeholders in the current war — maintain irreconcilable positions while pursuing unachievable goals.It is unlikely that Zelenskyy’s recent appeal for another $55 billion to cover budget shortfalls and reconstruction will find many supporters. Even Elon Musk, whose donation to Ukraine through his company SpaceX to provide Starlink satellite communications is projected to reach $100 million by the end of the year, indicated that there are limits to his generosity. Without Starlink internet terminals, on which the Ukrainian military is reliant for command and control, Kyiv’s ability to continue the fight will be severely degraded.On Wednesday, Putin issued yet another veiled nuclear threat as he and his security council are mulling a response to Ukraine's strike on Russian nuclear missile carriers stationed in a strategic aviation airbase in Russia proper. Paragraph 19 of the Russian nuclear doctrine allows the Kremlin to press the ""red button"" to launch a retaliatory strike when its strategic weapons facilities are attacked.The Russians have a very high tolerance for casualties, having sacrificed more than 20 million during World War II. Unless Washington steps in and compels Zelenskyy to negotiate an end to this bitter, devastating stalemate, Putin will fight till the last Ukrainian standing.Rebekah Koffler is the president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of  ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America.""

But America has paid a high price and the costs to foreign policy could add up for years.Here are the other big winners in Brittney Griner’s release: Putin, Saudi Arabia, Viktor Bout, and the Biden political machine.Many Americans regard vaping cannabis as less serious than a parking ticket. Even Whelan, who is still in prison in Russia, had the grace to say he was glad to see Griner freed.What really stinks is Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine. It was painful to see the State Department working to get Brittney Griner back, when civilians in Ukraine are dying at Putin’s hands and nuclear tensions are high.Griner’s release is a win for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, too. It turns out that maybe Biden was talking to him about something other than oil.  The Crown Prince wants to raise Saudi Arabia’s international profile, and he scored points brokering a deal with Russia and the U.S., and one that was announced just after a visit from Xi Jinping.Giving the Crown Prince a diplomatic success was also easy for Putin and will help keep up Russia’s status amongst the oil merchants of OPEC+  regardless of whatever happens in Ukraine.Of course, what really stinks is Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine.

The U.S. has also provided billions of dollars in economic support to Ukraine, enough to account for a majority of Ukraine’s annual budget.Last month, the Biden administration asked Congress for another $37.7 billion in support for Ukraine. If that passes, Congress will have approved more than $100 billion in Ukraine-related spending, although not all of that money went to Ukraine – for example, billions of it is being used to replenish U.S. weapons stocks.Still, any international plan to relieve Ukraine of debt payments or to eventually forgive the debt will affect the U.S. more than any other nation.The legislation approved by the House includes several other Ukraine-related provisions including extending U.S. security aid to Ukraine through 2023, a joint military trauma care and research agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, and ongoing short- and medium-term aid to the country.Pete Kasperowicz is a politics editor at Fox News Digital."

The yacht belonged to Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oil and media baron who has led a pro-Russian party in Ukraine for years, even after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas.According to The Guardian, it is the first such sale on behalf of the Ukrainian people since Western governments began to impose restrictions on the assets of hundreds of oligarchs.Medvedchuk was recently part of an unexpected September prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine. Some 300 people were exchanged, including the commanders who led a prolonged Ukrainian defense of Mariupol earlier this year.This year, many assets that made up Medvedchuk's 2021 net worth of $620 million have been seized by the Ukrainian government: palatial villas across Ukraine, cars and shares of capital in various companies.The United States now has its sights set on the $156 million yacht named Madame Gu, the New York Times reported. The craft, linked to Russian oligarch Andrei Skoch, has been named a blocked property by the U.S., but its seizure will prove diplomatically complicated. Madame Gu is currently docked in Dubai, with the U.A.E. balking at cooperation.The seizure of these crafts has been an important strategy pursued by the Biden administration."

President shows he's observer-in-chief, not a leader",President Biden keeps confusing process with strategy and real progress as the leader of the United States. It's a dangerous path,"After chatting up French President Emmanuel Macron during his pitstop in Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed a willingness to meet with Vladimir Putin to talk about Ukraine.Throughout his presidency, Biden has demonstrated a penchant for confusing process (talking, taking meetings, etc.) with progress. Sadly, there appears to be no discernable strategy behind these activities.The highlight of this ""strategy"" was a promise to be tough on China. A week later, after meeting Chinese President Xi, Biden declared that we just all need to get along. The ""strategy,"" it seems, was lost in the translation.All that is context for Biden's proposal to talk with Putin about ending his assault on Ukraine.It would also call for working with the Republicans in Congress to develop a post-war aid package—one that would help rebuild Ukraine, include rigorous accountability mechanisms to assure the assistance is spent wisely and not syphoned off by kleptocrats, and cut China out of the rebuilding process. Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine can afford to shovel foreign aid into a corrupt, bottomless hole.So far, President Biden has shown no interest in acting strategically. But if one hopes to lead the free world, it is not enough to simply talk with heads of state. There needs to be an actual, realistic plan, and the determination to follow through."

Their arrival Tuesday marked the final step in an arduous journey after they lived through sporadic bombings and drone attacks in Ukraine, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, one of several groups working to rescue animals from the war.Their new home is The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, about 90 miles north of Minneapolis. They were put on a plane that was returning to the U.S. from Poland. It landed Tuesday in Minneapolis, from where sanctuary staffers brought them to the facility where they were assessed by a veterinarian and given a warm place to rest. The flight was funded in part by the New York-based Andrew Sabin Family Foundation.Dr. Andrew Kushnir, an American veterinarian with the fund who accompanied the cubs on their flight, cared for the cubs in Ukraine and Poland. Despite drone attacks and airstrikes, he prepared their specialized formula every three hours, the fund said. On nights when the power went out, he used his arms and legs to warm their milk bottles.The cubs came from two litters, Whitney said. Three were rescued from Odesa, she said, while Prada, the oldest, was born at a breeder in Kyiv. The rescuers don't know what became of the mothers, she added.The nonprofit Wildcat Sanctuary shelters nearly 130 lions, tigers, cheetahs, leopards and other wildcats, many of which were rescued from the trade in exotic pets, including the four cubs.

Ted Cruz got into a heated exchange Tuesday after Shaheen shut down Cruz's questions for an ambassador nominee concerning allegations that then Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the country's top prosecutor in 2016.Cruz accused the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairwoman of ""covering"" for Biden after Shaheen prevented nominee George Kent from answering his questions during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Kent, who is Biden's choice to be the next ambassador to Estonia, had previously testified as a witness during former President Trump's first impeachment inquiry and told lawmakers that he raised concerns about Hunter Biden's lucrative service on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company – only to be rebuffed by the Biden administration.The gas company, Burisma Holdings, was under investigation in 2016 by Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who himself faced allegations of corruption. In 2018, Biden admitted that while he was vice president, he pushed Ukrainian officials to fire Shokin by threatening to cancel $1 billion of loan guarantees.However, before the nominee could answer, Shaheen intervened.""Are you going to allow him to answer the question, Madam Chairman?"" Cruz asked.""I am not going to allow him to answer the question,"" she replied.""Why are you covering for the vice president? Do you not want to answer that question?"" Cruz followed up. Shaheen responded by saying she thought it was ""unfortunate"" that Cruz was putting Biden's ambassador nominees in ""uncomfortable"" positions.However, Cruz pushed for Kent to be allowed to answer his ""yes or no"" question, to which Shaheen finally assented.""The prosecutor who was fired by the Ukrainian Parliament did nothing to investigate Zlochevsky and everything the Vice President Biden, the State Department and the U.S. Embassy did acted in good faith to reduce corruption and help the Ukrainians,"" Kent told Cruz.""So firing him did not benefit the oligarch?""

The funds come as part of a multinational effort to bolster Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which has been targeted with Russian missile strikes for more than a month.Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces shifted toward targeting Ukraine's power and water stations in early October, seeking to make Ukrainian citizens suffer through the country's bitter winter.In total, the U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February.The Biden administration is already struggling to track those funds, as Republicans warn of impending audits once they take control of the House in January.Likely future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said his party will not be giving Ukraine a ""blank check"" to fend off Russia's invasion. A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands. The Biden administration's previous tracking efforts have inspected only a fraction of the aid provided to the country.The Republican push to ramp up oversight enjoys some bipartisan support in Congress. Some staunch Ukraine allies fear the party will cut off aid to the country entirely, however.The lawmakers agree that current monitoring efforts appear woefully inadequate, with the Biden administration inspecting just 10% of the 22,000 weapons the U.S. has provided to Ukraine between February and Nov. 1, according to the Washington Post.McCarthy has based his criticism of the aid packages on America's economic situation as the economy threatens to fall into a recession.Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Many broke down from the sheer difficulty of the life imposed on them by Russia’s dictates.But incredibly no one… not a single person… and we spoke with dozens and dozens this trip… said Ukraine should give up. That it was just too much. That there was too much suffering. That Kyiv should hand over to Moscow what it demanded.Another thing we heard as well. That as bad as things were in cities like Kyiv and Lviv. They were worse where the men and women are fighting.Ukrainians know, as brave as they are, without the world’s help, their world as they know it, would be finished.So, as our team leaves this time, what is happening in Ukraine will remain in our hearts and minds. Knowing we’ll no doubt be back. For maybe harder times. Or perhaps… some good ones as well.Greg Palkot currently serves as a London-based senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
