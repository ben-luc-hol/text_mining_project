Seizing the rest would allow Russia to accelerate its offensive across more open terrain, he said.', '“The world has not yet met a well-prepared Russian Army, their units possessing all of the possible modern equipment that have not yet joined the battle,” the Wagner chief, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, said in a video message, speaking next to a World War II memorial in Bakhmut as explosions thundered in the distance.', 'Similarly, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a CNN interview that “we understand that after Bakhmut they could go further.” He said, “It would be open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine.”', 'But testifying in Washington before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, argued that Russia, having suffered — and inflicted — staggering losses in Ukraine, lacked the troops and the ammunition to make major advances this year. And she said its battered forces had a serious morale problem.', 'Russia has reportedly turned to North Korea for artillery shells and has bought attack drones from Iran.', '“If Russia does not initiate a mandatory mobilization and identify substantial third-party ammunition supplies, it will be increasingly challenging for them to sustain the current level of offensive operations in the coming months,” Ms. Haines said. “And consequently, they may fully shift to holding and defending territories they occupy. In short, we do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains.”', 'Each side in the war claimed this week that the battle for Bakhmut, which has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties, has been playing a vital role in weakening the enemy.', 'Russia has poured enormous resources into the fight, including Wagner’s tactic of sending waves of former prison inmates in near-suicide assaults. The Ukrainians have held on tenaciously, and claimed on Tuesday that the blood bath would leave Wagner a spent force; despite persistent rumors of withdrawal, they sent reinforcements to the city this week.', 'It is not only Russia whose resources are waning. Ukraine, with one-third as many people as Russia, can less easily absorb casualties. And Ukrainian forces, too, are chronically short of artillery ammunition, firing shells and rockets far faster than Western nations can supply them.', 'European Union defense ministers met on Wednesday to discuss the need to ramp up production of artillery ammunition to send to Ukraine, though no decisions were made. Until an increase gets underway, the E.U. leadership has proposed spending more than $1 billion to reimburse member nations for ammunition sent from their own stocks.', '“It’s not going to be short,” said Josep Borrell Fontelles, the E.U.’s chief foreign policy official. “But the sooner we start the better.”', 'The NATO nations have remained remarkably united in support of Ukraine, though that unity might be challenged by news about the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. The lines, delivering Russian gas to Germany, were badly damaged by explosions in September, and Western countries have not identified a culprit.', 'The New York Times reported on Tuesday that new intelligence cited by U.S. officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group had carried out the attack. The officials did not offer any more description of the group, its affiliations or its backers, other than to say that the saboteurs did not appear to have been working for a national military or intelligence agency.', 'Ukraine’s government has denied involvement. Ukraine “has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said on Twitter.', 'Any suggestion of Ukrainian involvement could undermine pro-Ukrainian sentiment, particularly in Germany, which was highly dependent on Russian gas before the war. The Nord Stream attack caused energy prices to spike worldwide, and forced Europe to make hurried arrangements to prevent a winter shortage of fuel.', 'German officials on Wednesday made it clear that they had not reached any conclusion about responsibility, and that they were awaiting the results of further investigations. Boris Pistorius, the defense minister, said without elaborating that the attack could also have been a “false-flag action” to make it appear that it had been carried out by pro-Ukrainian groups.', '“The likelihood of either is equally high,” he told a German public broadcaster.', 'For now the NATO alliance is presenting a mostly solid pro-Ukrainian front.', 'Western officials have long questioned the strategic value of Bakhmut, now a blasted, largely abandoned ruin of what was once a city of 70,000 people, and insist that if it does fall to the Russians, that will have little effect on the course of the war.', 'The NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in Brussels on Wednesday that “we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” but its loss, he said, would not prove decisive.', 'The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, said Monday that if Ukrainian forces pulled back to “some very defensible terrain” near the city, “I would not view that as an operational or a strategic setback.”', 'Ms. Haines, the intelligence director, described Russian advances in Bakhmut as “incremental progress,” and the city itself as not a “particularly strategic objective.”', 'But the two warring sides have staked enormous resources and pride on the fight for the city. Western officials estimate that up to 30,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in and around Bakhmut; Ukrainian casualties are also believed to be high, but Western officials refuse to give estimates.', 'Mr. Zelensky told CNN that “Russia needs at least some victory — a small victory — even by ruining everything in Bakhmut, just killing every civilian there.” That way, he said, Moscow can portray its military, to its own people, as powerful and successful.', 'Ms. Haines was at the Senate on Wednesday to present the U.S. intelligence community’s annual global threat assessment. It warned that “there is real potential for Russia’s military failures in the war to hurt Russian President Vladimir Putin’s domestic standing and thereby trigger additional escalatory actions by Russia in an effort to win back public support.”', 'The Kremlin has illegally declared annexation of four Ukrainian provinces, and controls the majority of that territory. Ms. Haines testified that Mr. Putin may now see a drawn-out war, even one that is temporarily stalemated, as his best option.', 'In that, she is in agreement with Ukrainian officials, who want to mount a counteroffensive soon, fearing that the longer the Russians hold the region, the harder they will be to dislodge.', '“Even as the Russian offensive continues, they are experiencing high casualty rates,” Ms. Haines said. “Putin is likely better understanding the limits of what his military is capable of achieving and appears to be focused on more limited military objectives for now.”']"

Five Months Later, He Was Dead.","Pvt. Ivan Ovlashenko was one of at least 16,000 Russians who have died in Ukraine, more than in the Soviets’ Afghan war. It’s getting hard for the Kremlin to cover that up.","['Soon after he deployed to Ukraine last fall, Pvt. Ivan A. Ovlashenko filmed a short video of himself wearing camouflage fatigues and an olive green fleece hat, sitting in a woods flecked with yellowing leaves while fellow soldiers nearby readied an artillery round to fire toward the Ukrainian lines.', '“I am recording everything right,” he said, grinning before shouting a warning, “Mortar!” The clip was meant to reassure relatives back in Russia that his sudden transition to frontline artilleryman was coming along just fine.', 'Until it wasn’t.', 'Last September, President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the mobilization of 300,000 men to bolster sagging Russian defenses in Ukraine. At the time, the hordes of men who fled Russia to avoid conscription attracted the most attention. Yet hundreds of thousands of Russians like Private Ovlashenko — factory laborers and electricians, medical orderlies and basketball players, tractor drivers and school workers — went off to war.', 'The promise of payouts of $3,000 or $4,000 a month proved a huge incentive, along with appeals to machismo and the defense of the motherland. “What am I, not a man?” Mr. Ovlashenko told two women, his sister and his former wife. “I need to protect my country, my daughter.”', 'In lengthy interviews, the women said they were surprised how Mr. Ovlashenko, largely apolitical to this point, suddenly began parroting the government’s far-fetched talking point about the West planning to use Ukraine as a staging ground to attack Russia. If he did not fight in Ukraine, he said, he would have to battle the enemy on the streets of Bataysk, his hometown, a railroad hub just outside the southwestern city of Rostov-on-Don.', 'The mobilization shifted the calculus of the war. It was no longer some distant “military operation,” as the Kremlin still calls it, fought by contract soldiers, mercenaries and Ukrainian separatists press-ganged into service. Suddenly, ordinary Russians were thrust into the trenches.', 'Now, more than five months later, the tempo of dead and wounded returning to Russia is picking up, with zinc coffins arriving in places like Bataysk. It is a pattern repeating itself across Russia, even if the dead remain largely hidden.', '“The numbers are secret,” said Max Trudolyubov, a Russian political analyst and newspaper columnist based in Vilnius, Lithuania. “The mobilized are from small towns, faraway places. The strategy is to spread the losses as thinly as possible across the country.”', 'Western intelligence officials estimate that 200,000 soldiers on the Russian side have been killed or wounded in the war. Of those, more than 16,000 have been confirmed dead in public sources, according to a project conducted jointly by Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet, the BBC News Russian Service and volunteer researchers. While the true number is undoubtedly far higher, even that figure already exceeds the official death toll during the Soviet Union’s nine-year war in Afghanistan.', 'The dead include more than 1,366 new recruits, according to the project. Private Ovlashenko, 30, was one of them.', 'He grew up in Bataysk, a descendant of a long line of railroad workers, and was just 16 months younger than his sister, Valentina, with whom he was very close. ', 'Valentina Strelkova, her married name, remembers her brother as a skinny, agile, fearless child — a potential circus acrobat. He remained devoted to his sister throughout his life, she said, dropping whatever he was doing whenever she needed him.', 'After he completed his compulsory military service, he went to work for Pepsi in merchandising.', ' Valeria Ovlashenka worked for Pepsi, too, in sales. When she spurned his advances, he gave a party for the entire staff, greeting her with a bouquet. He soon proposed, and the next day she discovered that she was pregnant. They married in March 2017, and their daughter, Polina, was born later that summer.', 'They quarreled frequently, not least over how to raise their daughter. Ms. Ovlashenka sought to replicate her own strict upbringing, while her husband made Polina the center of his life. He ironed her diapers and put her to sleep. He bought her toys and candy, took her to see the sea, and taught her to pick mushrooms in the deep northern forests. “It was always a holiday for the child,” she said.', 'They divorced after two years but neither dated anybody else, and Ms. Ovlashenka always hoped that they would reunite.', 'The mobilization summons on Sept. 26 came as a shock to his ex-wife and his sister, especially since Mr. Ovlashenko signed it immediately. “He was never interested or involved in political news,” said his sister.', 'He told his ex-wife of his decision to enlist when he was bringing their daughter back after a weekend, saying that he was leaving the next day. “He said it with such a smirk, as if he was leaving for a sanitarium,” she said, “I tried to talk him out of it.” She called the whole situation meaningless, arguing that he should stay home to raise Polina.', '“I didn’t see my husband as a patriot,” she said. “I think that he just wanted a change of scenery.”', 'Mr. Ovlashenko’s father and sister drove to the training camp, more than an hour away, every day. They were given a list of necessities to rustle up — basically, everything except his flak jacket and helmet. They bought him warmer clothes, kneepads, a sleeping bag, a backpack and two balaclavas, among other equipment, spending more than $1,200. He was embarrassed, but grateful, and eventually the local regional government reimbursed them.', 'Mr. Ovlashenko was unexpectedly dispatched to Donetsk after just a week at the camp, his family said. During his earlier military service, he had been a driver. This time, he was assigned to an artillery unit. The newly mobilized soldiers received no training at the training center, he told them: “Everything I learned, I learned at the front.”', 'He never shared exactly where he was, but with each call, the sound of big guns rumbled ever louder. For the most part, he said things were “fine,” although he let the mask slip once. “‘You cannot imagine what I am doing here,’” he told his sister, sounding terrified. Then he clammed up.', 'Outwardly, his face became more masculine, sterner, his former wife said, while his eyes often got a frantic look that she recognized from their marital spats.', 'He did not talk about the dead much. Once, when his ex-wife asked about the commotion she could hear in the background, he said that the soldiers were drinking to commemorate fallen comrades. Another time he allowed that he had seen a lot of “cold” corpses, but few recently killed.', 'In December, after he suffered a light shrapnel wound in the shoulder, his calls became more frequent and more emotional. “It was like he burst,” said Ms. Ovlashenka. He sent money constantly for Polina — for clothes, a tree for the holidays, the circus and a ski trip.', 'When his ex-wife broached the topic of their reuniting, however, he backed off, and they postponed the discussion until he returned.', 'New Year’s Eve was the last time his sister spoke to him. “He was very cheerful, upbeat, positive,” she said. On Jan. 6, he called his former wife to ask if Polina liked her presents.', 'The last sign of life came on Jan. 9. When he could not talk, he would text an emoji like a smiley face.', 'Starting Jan. 10, there was a troubling silence. His sister dialed all the numbers he had called from, but nobody knew anything. Private Ovlashenko hugged her in a dream so vivid that she felt he had come to say goodbye.', 'On Jan. 14, the family learned from the Bataysk military recruitment office that he had been killed when a tank shell exploded in his trench near Makiivka, Ukraine.', 'They were told that his corpse had been shipped to nearby Rostov, to the main military morgue, but the military told them not to visit. The explosion had ripped his body apart, and they were having trouble identifying him. The family hoped that they had the wrong guy, but a fingerprint soon confirmed that it was him.', 'There was no open coffin at the funeral on Jan. 20. An honor guard fired off a salute in the muddy cemetery, and his father emitted a strangled cry, “Vanyuk!” — his son’s nickname — as they buried him, according to 161.ru, a regional online newspaper.', 'Polina, 5, was not at the funeral, but she knew about the war. Her mother initially told her that her father was on a long business trip, but Polina figured out from the calls that he was at the front.', 'At school, they took up a small collection, and they always mentioned her father when they talked about war heroes. Polina misses him terribly, and often encourages her mother to find her a new daddy. “I tell her, ‘Daughter, we don’t have a store where we can get a new daddy,’” she said. “There will always be one daddy. He’s in heaven.”', 'In late February, the family held the traditional ceremony marking 40 days since his death. They skipped the normal ritual of leaving food on his grave, as the local priest said it would be better to donate it to needy families.', '“He had chosen a peaceful life, a peaceful profession, a nonmilitary specialty,” his sister said. “But his life completely disintegrated in a different way.”']"

This achievement, Ukrainian officials say, justifies their own high casualty toll, though soldiers in the field and some military analysts have questioned the wisdom of defending a mostly abandoned, ruined city.', 'In seesaw fighting on the city’s artillery-blasted streets and nearby villages and farm fields, the losses on both sides have been staggering, in the longest sustained Russian assault since the invasion last year. Gradual Russian advances have led some Ukrainian officials in recent weeks to hint at the possibility of a retreat to avoid encirclement, but Ukrainian assault brigades went on the attack over the weekend and appeared to push back Russian forces.', 'Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, which has led Russian assaults on Bakhmut, said on Monday that Russia was at risk of losing the battle — just days after he had claimed to have the Ukrainians on the brink of defeat.', 'After meeting with top generals on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that both the commander in chief of Ukraine’s military, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, and the commander of ground forces, Oleksandr Syrsky, supported reinforcing Bakhmut’s defenses.', '“Both generals replied: do not withdraw and reinforce,” Mr. Zelensky said later in his nightly video address. He added, “I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut.”', 'Neither in his address, nor in a statement issued earlier by his office, was any mention made of a possibility some independent analysts have described — a quiet, gradual Ukrainian pullback into smaller, easier-to-defend pockets within the city, rather than a broad, sudden retreat.', 'In attacking Bakhmut since last summer, Russia’s signature tactic has been to send waves of assaults by small units that suffer fearful losses, probing defenses and forcing the Ukrainians who gun them down to reveal their positions to follow-up attackers. In particular, fighters recruited from among prison inmates by the Wagner mercenary group have been used this way.', 'Asked on Monday about the fighting in Bakhmut, Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. defense secretary, said, “What I do see on a daily basis is the Russians continuing to pour in a lot of ill-trained and ill-equipped troops, and those troops are very quickly meeting their demise.”', 'No independent count of the dead and wounded has been possible, and each side is seen as inflating the other’s losses while concealing its own. Over the weekend, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, Oleksiy Danilev, asserted that Russia’s loses in attacking entrenched positions were seven times Ukraine’s.', 'But Ukraine, with a population one-third of Russia’s, is less able to absorb the losses, and is trading the lives of experienced soldiers for those of Russian ex-convicts whose Wagner commanders often treat as expendable.', 'The fighting in Bakhmut has taken a central place in a power struggle between the Russian armed forces and Wagner’s ambitious, self-promoting leader, Mr. Prigozhin, who has repeatedly accused the military leaders of incompetence and of depriving him of needed ammunition. On Monday, he wrote on social media that Wagner’s representative to the regional military command “had his pass canceled and was denied access to the group’s headquarters.”', 'Later in the day, in an audio message on social media, Mr. Prigozhin claimed that it was his forces that were in danger of being trapped, in a coming Ukrainian counteroffensive, and said that Wagner units needed more men and munitions.', 'His bureaucratic rival, Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, made a rare visit on Monday to Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, including the city of Mariupol, the defense ministry said. Video montages released by the ministry showed a stony-faced Mr. Shoigu looking over maps and talking to subordinates, a muted contrast to Mr. Prigozhin’s hyperbolic video dispatches, often claiming to be on the front lines and making unverified claims about Wagner’s advances.', 'Western officials say Russian forces have suffered around 200,000 killed or wounded, a devastating toll in a little over a year of war, in addition to the loss of thousands of tanks and armored vehicles. To make up for those losses, they have poured into Ukraine inexperienced conscripts called up last fall.', 'Recent Russian attacks along the front lines in eastern Ukraine were at first regarded as exploratory stages of Russia’s long-anticipated spring offensive, but are increasingly being seen by military analysts as the best that exhausted Russian forces can manage.', 'Some Ukrainian units inside Bakhmut are expected to deploy to southern Ukraine for a counteroffensive aimed at the occupied city of Melitopol, possibly in the spring, in a bid to split Russian-occupied land in two and even threaten Moscow’s hold on the Crimean peninsula. That would require crossing, with little cover, dozens of miles of flat farmland, which is heavily mined and defended by the Russians.', 'Capturing Bakhmut would hand Russia its first significant battlefield victory in months, while for Ukraine, the city has become an emblem of resistance.', 'But withdrawing from Bakhmut would not alter the strategic picture, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian minister of defense, said in an interview on Monday. “If we walked out of Bakhmut they would just move to the next city, using exactly with the same tactics,” Mr. Zagorodnyuk said.', '“This tactic has been working,” he said of the Russian human wave attacks, but it has been confined mostly to Bakhmut; it cannot be replicated widely because of a shortage of recruited prisoners.', 'Russian forces are now attacking the city from three directions and fighting for control of access roads to the west, needed by Ukraine for resupplying troops, evacuating the wounded and for an exit if the decision comes to withdraw. ', 'On Monday morning, Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces “continue attempts to storm the city of Bakhmut and neighboring settlements.”', 'Mr. Zelensky, who last month called Bakhmut “our fortress” and vowed not to give up the city, used his nightly address on Sunday to praise Ukrainian soldiers defending it for their bravery.', 'The city’s defense has become a symbol of defiance in Ukraine, even as the Ukrainian military, which had been praised for its adroitness in previous battles, has become enmeshed in a grinding clash in Bakhmut that has persisted for months as casualties mounted. A song lauding the defenders of “fortress Bakhmut” has played on Ukrainian radio. And there is no sign, so far, that Mr. Zelensky is losing popular support for the city’s defense.', '“It is one of the toughest battles,” he said of fighting in eastern Ukraine. “Painful and challenging.”', 'But if the Ukrainians were to pull back to “some very defensible terrain” near the city, “I would not view that as an operational or a strategic setback,” Mr. Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, told reporters while traveling in Jordan. “I certainly don’t want to discount the tremendous work that the Ukrainians’ soldiers and leaders have put into defending Bakhmut, but I think it’s more of a symbolic value than it is a strategic and operational value.”', 'Ukrainian special forces signaled another act of defiance against Russia on Monday by openly announcing a drone strike inside Russian territory, which destroyed an unmanned observation tower in the Bryansk region. That was a break from Ukraine’s policy of deliberate ambiguity over such strikes inside Russia.', 'Russia and Ukraine share a land border extending more than 1,200 miles, including several hundred miles in the eastern Donbas region, parts of which are controlled by Moscow. Russia has used territories close to Ukraine — including Bryansk, along Ukraine’s northeastern border — to stage ground, air and artillery assaults on Ukraine throughout the war.', 'The timing of the attack on the observation tower was not clear, but the Kraken unit, which reports to Ukrainian military intelligence, released a video that it said showed the assault, on its Telegram channel on Monday. It came days after a brief armed incursion into Russia, also in the Bryansk region, by a group of Russian volunteers claiming to fight for Ukraine.', 'Officials in Kyiv have said they reserve the right to strike targets within Russia that they say are used to attack Ukrainian towns and cities, but have promised not to use weapons supplied by Western allies, who fear Moscow could view that as a provocation.']"

Farther behind, a second company was parked, an occasional light inside a car revealing the face of a soldier. Still farther back, a third company was moving into place.', 'After months of epic struggle, the fight over the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut had seemed in recent days to be reaching a climax, with Russian forces close to encircling the city and some Ukrainian units pulling out.', 'Then, early Saturday, Ukrainian assault brigades went on the attack. Over the weekend, hundreds of troops joined the counteroffensive, mounting assaults from the ground and pounding Russian positions with artillery from the surrounding hills.', 'Ukrainian commanders acknowledged that their forces in Bakhmut still faced the risk of encirclement, but the fighting over the weekend showed that a military that has surprised the world with its doggedness was not yet ready to give up on Bakhmut. How holding the city might fit in with its broader plans was less clear.', 'Even before Ukraine stepped up its attack on Russians in Bakhmut on the weekend, its forces had moved to beat Russian troops back from the last main highway into the city. That preserved both a supply line that has helped Ukrainian soldiers tie down the Russian offensive for months and an exit route for them should they decide to retreat.', '“I’m confident Bakhmut will hold,” said Col. Yevhen Mezhevikin, commander of a combined tactical group fighting in Bakhmut. “We have enough forces to throw the enemy back from this city, but it depends on the tasks the command has, be it holding the city, or inflicting maximum losses on the enemy.”', 'Soldiers on the ground expressed weariness, but they did not seem ready to give up.', 'Bakhmut itself, a city with a prewar population of 70,000 inhabitants, has little strategic value. It was simply the next in the line of fire of a Russian offensive to seize the eastern province of Donetsk. But the battle for the city has created a defining moment of the war for both the Russian and the Ukrainian armies. No longer is the fight about Bakhmut: It is a marathon contest to see which army can break the other.', 'Russia has thrown tens of thousands of newly mobilized troops into a huge ground assault to take the city by sheer force of fire and manpower. Ukraine has used every hard-learned tactic from a year of war to hold ground and inflict maximum casualties on the invader, often battling from house to house in neighborhoods of smashed houses and stunted trees.', 'Ukrainian troops have steadily lost ground, ceding outlying villages and suburbs in recent weeks. And late winter has been particularly punishing. Weeks of freezing temperatures and now the onset of the mud season have sapped their strength, soldiers said.', '“The fog is constant — every night we see almost nothing,” the  commander of a combat drone unit attached to the 59th Brigade, who goes by the code name Madyar, said in a video message from the front.', '“The temperature is above zero for a third day,” he added. “Everything melted. Mud up to the knee. Rain 10 times a day. Makes it difficult to perform tactical tasks.”', 'Late last week, Madyar said his unit was pulling out. Other units have, as well. It remains unclear if the movements were part of a rotation or of a controlled withdrawal.', 'In one nearby town, Chasiv Yar, the terrifying power of the Russian assault is unmistakable. Shops and homes are boarded up and the streets are deserted save for a few civilians carrying plastic shopping bags. Earsplitting explosions sounded almost constantly on recent visits as Ukrainian artillery fired on Russian positions in and around Bakhmut and Russian guns returned fire.', 'One woman, Lena, walking home with her shopping on Saturday afternoon, ignored the explosions and barely glanced at unexploded rockets sticking out of the asphalt.', '“My daughter left but I stayed,” she said.', '“It’s home,” she said in explanation.', 'Others are getting out.', 'Early one morning last week, rescue workers from the charity Save Ukraine raced in to evacuate some of the last residents in a particularly exposed neighborhood near the canal.

His wife was ailing with stomach pain, the husband said.', 'Ukrainian Army units are spread out across the undulating hills that stretch for miles around Chasiv Yar and Bakhmut. Artillery guns and tanks are ranged in the tree lines, and soldiers are dispersed in private houses, their vehicles hidden under camouflage nets or behind buildings.', 'Overhead, Ukrainian jets fly occasionally, often heading in the morning on sorties toward the front line. But this is predominantly an artillery war.', '“We repel 15 to 20 attacks a day,” said Vladyslav, 26, commander of a self-propelled artillery battery positioned four or five miles from the outskirts of Bakhmut. “Today it is going more or less fine,” he said cheerfully.', 'The tempo of artillery fire has been extraordinary.', '“On average we fire 80 to 120 shells a day,” Vladyslav said. “In one and a half months we fired more than 5,000 shells.”', 'But artillery ammunition is running low — a problem senior commanders say helps explain their steady loss of ground.', '“There is a shortage,” Colonel Mezhevikin said. “I would like more people, more vehicles, more ammunition to destroy the enemy on the approaches, and his reserves, so our people would have fewer losses and not have such intense fighting.”', 'Units have had to learn to be judicious with their ammunition, said Maj. Oleksandr Pantsyrny, commander of the Aidar assault battalion, a renowned fighting unit. “It’s constant planning, calculation of ammunition consumption.”', 'Those restrictions have Ukrainian combat units struggling to stem the advances of the Wagner group, the private military company that has been leading the Russian offensive to take Bakhmut.', 'Wagner has bolstered its numbers with thousands of convicts, but its core professionals have proved able fighters, several Ukrainian commanders who fought them said.', '“We realized they were a worthy adversary,” Major Pantsyrny said. “They have pretty good combat experience; they have motivated personnel.”', 'His battalion was sent to storm Wagner positions at the village of Kodema, south of Bakhmut.', '“The enemy would send 20 guys into attack six to seven times a day,” said Oleksandr, a company commander who took part in the assault. He did not give his surname in accordance with military protocol. “Imagine: Twenty guys come, we kill them. In five minutes, 20 more guys come, we kill them. In an hour, 20 more. They don’t care about men.”', 'Then after three weeks, the Russians surprised the battalions with a flanking movement, breaking through a weaker unit from the side.  The Aidar battalion was forced to retreat.', 'A commander from another battalion, Dnipro 1, which spent months pitted against Wagner units, said he found them more agile and enterprising than most Russian Army units.', 'The commander, who uses the code name Duke, said Wagner used untrained prisoners in the first line of attack and then, after one or two hours, as the Ukrainian troops were tiring, sent special forces into the fray, attacking from the flanks. “It was very good tactics,” Duke said.', 'But Ukraine has been able to use Bakhmut as a kill box to grind down the vast numbers of newly mobilized Russian soldiers who were introduced to the battlefield late last year, he said.

U.S. officials told The Times that they had no evidence that the attack was done at the direction of the Ukrainian government, and Kyiv has denied any responsibility.', 'Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defense minister, said on Wednesday, without elaborating, that the attack could also have been a “false-flag action” to make it appear that it had been carried out by pro-Ukrainian groups.', '“The likelihood of either is equally high,” he told a German public broadcaster, saying that he would wait on further developments before commenting on what he called “hypothetical research.”', 'Germany has delivered more weapons than any other European Union country to Ukraine, and although many Germans back the government’s support, there are fears that sending weapons into a war zone will lengthen the conflict and risk setting off a wider war. Any hint that Ukraine’s government was behind the pipeline attack could make it harder for Chancellor Olaf Scholz to continue delivering heavy weapons and providing training for Ukrainian soldiers.', 'Suspicion over the attack — which affected three of the four pipelines that make up Nord Stream 1 and 2 — immediately fell on Moscow, but speculation about who was to blame has included Kyiv, London and Washington.', 'The attack compounded fears in Germany of a gas shortage during the winter. Fifty-five percent of all gas used in Germany before the war had come from Russia, and although in the months after the invasion Germany had weaned itself off much of the natural gas it was receiving directly from Russia, the explosions made it clear that there was no going back.', 'Ukraine has rejected the reports linking a pro-Ukrainian group to the pipeline attack. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, posted on Twitter: “Although I enjoy collecting amusing conspiracy theories about Ukrainian government, I have to say: Ukraine has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap and has no information about ‘pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups.’”', 'Russia welcomed the reports that Moscow was not involved, though officials continued to point a finger at Western countries.

In recent weeks, Moscow has ramped up an offensive to seize the whole of Donbas, sending troops that it mobilized last fall into the fight.', 'In an indication of the severity of the fighting in the east of the country and its broad geographical reach, the Ukrainian military’s General Staff said on Sunday that its forces had repelled 130 Russian attacks on Saturday.', '“The adversary continues its attempts to encircle the town of Bakhmut,” it said, listing attacks on a string of small towns and settlements near Bakhmut.', 'The fighting on Saturday killed two civilians in Bakhmut, the head of the regional Ukrainian military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Sunday in a post on the Telegram social messaging app. Seven civilians were wounded in the region, he added.', 'Before the war, Bakhmut had a population of about 70,000, but the Ukrainian authorities say that only a few thousand civilians remain. They have been working to evacuate those who have stayed, but the task has become harder as the roads out of the city have increasingly come under threat.', 'Moscow has been advancing on Bakhmut from territory it already holds to the east of the city, taking towns and villages that have more recently enabled it to attack the city from the north and south.', 'Russia has rushed large numbers of troops to the area around Bakhmut, including many newly mobilized recruits. Ukraine has also sent reinforcements to the battle. Both sides have sustained heavy casualties.', 'Military experts say that Russia’s offensive is being fought at five or six points along a front line that stretches about 100 miles from the town of Kreminna in Luhansk to Vuhledar in Donetsk, where Moscow suffered heavy losses in a tank battle in recent weeks.', 'While Russian forces have not made significant territorial gains in their renewed offensive, they have been tightening the claw around Bakhmut. Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine vowed that Ukraine would not give up on Bakhmut, calling it “our fortress.” But in recent days, Ukrainian officials have been preparing the public for the possibility of a retreat.', 'Mick Ryan, a military analyst and retired Australian Army major general who is a fellow at the Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Sydney, wrote on Sunday that Russian forces, despite heavy losses, had “slowly but surely begun to take ground in and around Bakhmut.” He said in a post on Substack that “Russia is strangling (but not yet stopping) the Ukrainian capacity to defend the city.”', 'That sentiment was echoed by the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based research group. It said that Russian forces “will not likely be able to encircle the city soon,” but that by closing in on the roads that are the vital lifelines of supply for Ukrainian fighters, they could force Kyiv’s forces to abandon their defensive positions and withdraw.', 'If Russia does eventually capture Bakhmut, it would be the culmination of one of the longest-running and bloodiest battles of the war, but questions would remain about Russia’s ability to sustain its offensive and gain further ground in eastern Ukraine.', '“The reality is that if the Russians do capture Bakhmut, they are seizing rubble,” Mr. Ryan said. “It is a town with minimal strategic importance, with almost no remaining infrastructure to support an occupying force. That the Russians have invested so much in its capture speaks volumes about their poor strategy in this war.”', 'Elsewhere on the long front line, Moscow has continued to shell civilian areas in Ukraine over the past few weeks as its offensive has ramped up, often with devastating consequences.', 'Russian shelling killed a woman and two children on Sunday in the village of Poniativka in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, according to the regional authorities and Andriy Yermak, head of the president’s office in Ukraine.

But experts also caution that it is difficult to predict the precise location of Kyiv’s next drive.', 'Russian and Ukrainian forces have spent months preparing for their renewed offensives. As Ukraine awaits the arrival of new, sophisticated weapons from Western allies, the government in Kyiv could gain an advantage because Russia has effectively launched its offensive first, according to Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA, a research institute focused on national security.', '“Ukraine is much better off receiving this Russian offensive, having the Russian military exhaust itself, then launching their major operation later in the spring perhaps, very likely, in the south in Zaporizhzhia,” he said last month on the War on the Rocks podcast.']"

Officers and pilots described\xa0how the Ukrainian\xa0brigades moved their aircraft\xa0at the onset of the war to evade Russian strikes,\xa0and\xa0how they\xa0adapted their tactics\xa0to fighting a much more powerful and better equipped adversary.', '“We go where we should not go,” said Oleksiy, 38, a colonel and deputy commander of the brigade. He gave only his first name in keeping with military protocol. “The main task is to destroy the enemy by fire.”', 'Compared with the well-documented ground war in Ukraine, where destroyed tanks and armor have been so visible, much less is known about the aerial war, partly because there is less photographic and video evidence. But Russian jets attacked targets intensively in the first weeks of the war, and Ukrainian and Russian jets battled each other numerous times in the skies above.', 'Both sides also used helicopters for critical tasks because of their mobility. Russia landed troops in the first days in at least two locations, and Ukraine flew rescue missions into the besieged\xa0Azovstal plant in Mariupol. Yet helicopters have also proved vulnerable as the fighting primarily turned into an artillery war on the open plains of eastern Ukraine, and tasks were limited to firing rockets from Ukrainian lines.', 'The Ukrainians fly aging Russian-made helicopters — mainly the Mi-8 and the Mi-24, both used as attack helicopters — that were designed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.', '“These are helicopters from the last century,” said Oleksiy, who has eight years of combat experience, five of those spent on peacekeeping missions in Africa, holding off guerrilla groups. Their weapons, unguided, Soviet-era rockets, “are very outdated and don’t meet the requirements of modern combat.”', '“We do not have long-range precision weapons,” he added. “In modern combat, any aircraft — a helicopter, a plane — should be viewed as a high-precision weapons carrier.”', 'Like many in the Ukrainian military, he and his men sense they could push the Russians out of Ukraine with smarter weapons. “We must move away from Russian helicopters,” he said.', 'Ukraine has not publicly requested western helicopters, instead emphasizing its need for sophisticated artillery and tanks. The United States sent about a dozen Russian-made transport helicopters\xa0in June that it had originally purchased for Afghanistan before the Taliban took over. In November, Britain said it was sending three Sea King helicopters and promised to train 10 Ukrainian military crews to use them.', 'One consolation for the Ukrainians is that their Russian adversaries are flying similar machines whose design has not advanced much in recent decades, but Russia has a big advantage in the volume of helicopters\xa0and ammunition. “Most of their weapons are also from Soviet times,” Oleksiy said, “but you can’t underestimate the fact they have a lot of this Soviet metal.”', 'Russia’s overwhelming firepower has forced the Ukrainians to find other ways to fight.', '“We are smaller, so we should use a smart approach,” said Roman, 34, one of the most experienced pilots from the 16th brigade, who has been seconded to the 18th, in an interview between combat flights. “We do the best we can.”', 'That has entailed retraining, constantly adapting to conditions and also some daring in their operations. The brigade keeps its helicopters in plain sight, on the wide, snow-swept steppe of eastern Ukraine, using temporary airfields, moving frequently for security.', 'They have developed a method of attack flying below the tree line, less than 30 feet from the ground, hugging the contours of the land at up to 150 miles per hour. The low altitude is treacherous, but avoids radar detection.', 'Then right at the front line they make a sudden ascent to fire a burst of 30 to 40 rockets before veering away, back the way they came.', 'They attack in pairs, sometimes in a pack of four. They can fire on Russian positions without flying too close to them,\xa0but it tests pilots and machines to their limits, and for dangerous seconds on the ascent exposes them to Russian anti-air defense systems.', 'Approaching enemy lines, Ukrainian jets and helicopters run the gamut of Russian attacks, from radio-electronic interference to antiaircraft missiles fired from jets and from the ground.', '“Every operation, every sortie is a heroic flight,” Oleksiy said.\xa0“Many of the militaries of other countries would not undertake these flights in the face of such countermeasures.”', 'A pilot from the 18th Brigade, Ivan, 31, was hit by Russian air defense just as he unleashed his payload of rockets in June last year. He recalls everything turning black, but managed to turn the helicopter.', '“You have thoughts, but you feel nothing and see nothing,” he said as he recounted his ordeal in an interview. “You understand that something is happening. I realized that, most likely, I was hit.”', 'He crashed in a forest that was pockmarked with craters and smoking from shell fire. His co-pilot was killed, but Ivan and the engineer were thrown through the front of the cockpit as the machine burst into flames, he said.', 'Badly concussed, with his head sliced open, a fractured spine and a broken leg, he managed to crawl to check on his engineer, who complained of broken collarbones. Swimming in and out of consciousness, he sent their coordinates to his brigade. Under shellfire just yards from Russian positions, they lay motionless when a reconnaissance drone passed overhead, unsure whose it was, until Ukrainian medics rescued them.', 'The Ukrainian helicopter brigades have all lost men and machines, although how many remains a military secret. But their survival and continued operations a year into the war is a major success, military analysts said.', 'When the invasion came, the aviation brigades were prepared. They had heeded Western warnings of the pending Russian invasion and were ready\xa0to evacuate their main bases and disperse their helicopters and engineering crews for safety, the deputy commander Oleksiy said.', '“We had a defined plan of action in case of a missile strike, a ground offensive, where to go, which sites, where our logistics units would meet us,” he said. “There was no panic. Everything was rehearsed.”', 'Nevertheless, pilots recalled the first days of the war as chaotic and dangerous, plagued by cases of friendly fire. Civilians were calling in sightings of Russian troops, and helicopters were sent to attack multiple locations. One of the biggest battles was for the Hostomel airport, just north of Kyiv, the capital, where Ukrainian forces aided by attack helicopters repulsed a Russian attempt to seize the airfield.', 'Critically for Ukrainian aviation, the Russians never secured air superiority over Ukraine thanks to its effective air-defense systems. Both sides have continued to fly jets and helicopters,\xa0although they have come to avoid venturing deep\xa0into each other’s territory for fear of being shot down.', 'One of the striking exceptions was a run of daring flights that Ukrainian helicopters made into the Azovstal steel plant, a last holdout of Ukrainian troops in the besieged city of Mariupol.', '“It’s impossible,” Oleksiy said, recalling his first reaction to the Azovstal plan. But pilots volunteered, and they succeeded in flying undetected across 70 miles of Russian-held territory into the steel plant, ferrying in ammunition and evacuating the wounded.', '“The first missions were successful because the enemy couldn’t imagine that the Ukrainians would dare,” Oleksiy said. “After they realized we were doing it, how we were getting there, the missions started taking losses.” The flights ended after the loss of three helicopters, only days before the Ukrainians surrendered.', 'By chance, part of Ukraine’s helicopter force was on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo when Russia began its invasion last year. It was unable to return for several months, but when it did, it added experienced pilots and more helicopters to the depleted force.', 'These days, the Sikorsky\xa0brigade has settled into a practiced routine. Pilots are up before dawn, although some later than others, one pilot joked. Most pilots declined to be interviewed or asked that their names and photographs not be published for security reasons.', 'They are often in the sky on the day’s first combat mission at first light, weather permitting, and can make up to 10 flights a day, returning to refuel, rearm and wait for the next task. Drinking instant coffee in their canteen last week, they rose in unison when the order came.', '“We are always near our ‘iron horses,’” said Ivan, the pilot, who is back on duty but not flying until he fully heals. “They tell you the location and what to do.”', 'Western training has allowed for more initiative\xa0by crews to choose their routes and tactics, he added.', 'The\xa0pilots\xa0remain confident about their abilities but are acutely aware of their limitations.

Putin of Russia.', 'In 2019, Ms. von der Leyen announced that she would lead a “geopolitical commission,” to learn to use “the language of power.” But comprehending the need for the bloc to think and act as a global player is quite different from doing so.', '“There is an understanding of the need but an inability to meet the moment, which is a geopolitical moment,” Ms. Conley said. “Europe shifted east with an enlargement process that needed to be geopolitical from the start but became technical. They lost their way.”', 'The European Union has nonetheless coalesced impressively since the invasion. It has sharply cut dependency on Russian energy, especially natural gas. It approved 10 packages of sanctions against Russia. It reduced two-way trade with Russia by 135 billion euros (about $143 billion), while providing Ukraine with more than €38 billion in financial and humanitarian aid and €12 billion in military support, noted Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner for trade.', 'According to the Kiel Institute, which tracks aid to Ukraine, the Europeans have earmarked some €54.9 billion (about $58 billion) for Ukraine, while the United States has committed €73.1 billion, €44.3 billion of it military. Despite all the criticism of Brussels as slow to act, E.U. institutions have provided the second-largest amount of total aid, at €35 billion, while Germany is the third-largest donor country after the United States and Britain.', 'Ms. Johansson emphasized that the Commission, which is traditionally stuffed with lawyers who draft regulations, was learning to be “operational,” for example transforming an existing mechanism to reimburse member states for their military contributions to Ukraine.', 'Brussels has committed to supporting the government in Kyiv with €1.5 billion a month for a year, Mr. Dombrovskis said, matching Washington’s contribution, with more to be added by multinational financial institutions.', 'But those figures will be trifling compared with the costs of reconstruction, estimated already at $1 trillion, let alone of eventual Ukrainian membership in the union. And there are already minority voices in the bloc that are anxious over the cost and its possible political impact.', 'As Sanna Marin, the prime minister of Finland, said at the Munich Security Conference last month, “I’m worried about the resilience of E.U. citizens. There are divisions. In many countries in Europe, people are frustrated with high inflation, high energy prices and say the war must end, it’s causing too much trouble.”', 'Politicians must be clear about their commitment to “support Ukraine as long as necessary,” she said. “But the next year will be difficult.”', 'And not just the next year, but many years to come. Having offered Ukraine a path to membership, the Europeans will be expected to take more responsibility for its reconstruction and institutional transformation from a relatively corrupt post-Soviet state into a European democracy clean enough to join the bloc.', '“The Americans will say, ‘We took care of the war, now you take care of the reconstruction,’” said Camille Grand, a former senior NATO official now with the European Council on Foreign Relations. However exaggerated, that is the expectation in the American Congress, he noted.', 'The Group of 7 industrialized countries has set up an agency for reconstruction, but the Europeans will have to play a central role, both in financing it and in guiding Ukraine to revamp its institutions and reduce corruption.', 'As happened with the post-Soviet countries of Central and Eastern Europe, it is likely that Ukraine, with its history of corruption and oligarchic rule, will be able to join NATO before it qualifies to join the European Union.', 'Given that, said Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung, “the big issue will be how to give Ukraine political guarantees below membership level,” since the promise of E.U. membership “is the main hope that keeps them alive.”', 'The process of E.U. accession is the best guarantee that Ukraine will reform and will use reconstruction aid efficiently, said Radoslaw Sikorksi, a member of the European Parliament and former foreign and defense minister of Poland.', 'Ukraine is already receiving E.U. pre-accession funds, which will grow. “That will be hundreds of billions over a decade, and that will be Ukraine’s real Marshall Plan,” Mr. Sikorski said. And if security is assured, private investment will flow in, he said.', 'He is optimistic about Ukraine’s eventual future in Europe. As an exporter of carbon-free nuclear energy, a huge and fertile agricultural power and a source of adaptable computer technology, he said, “I think when the war finally ends, Ukraine can be rich.”']"

Blinken and his Russian counterpart on Thursday held the first private, face-to-face exchange between a U.S. cabinet member and a top Kremlin official since the invasion, and Mr. Blinken said he used the encounter to demand that Russia end its war on Ukraine.', 'The unscheduled encounter with Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, at an international conference in New Delhi showed that the Biden administration saw a need to reestablish in-person diplomatic contacts with Moscow so the two governments can discuss the year-old war as well as issues beyond it.', 'Mr. Blinken said at a news conference on Thursday night that in addition to calling for Russia to halt its “war of aggression” in Ukraine, he told Mr. Lavrov that Russia should return to the New START nuclear arms control treaty it withdrew from last month and comply with its terms. And he once again urged Moscow to free Paul Whelan, an American citizen who the State Department says is wrongfully imprisoned on espionage charges.', 'The meeting with Mr. Lavrov, which lasted less than 10 minutes, occurred on the sidelines of a gathering here of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations representing the world’s largest economies. In the morning, Mr. Blinken said in a group session that was also attended by Mr. Lavrov and Qin Gang, the foreign minister of China, that the countries had to continue to call on Russia to “withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability.”', 'The encounter came at a critical moment in the largest and most destructive conflict in Europe since World War II. Both sides are marshaling more troops and weapons for planned spring offensives, hoping to score decisive breakthroughs. Russian troops are closing in on the besieged city of Bakhmut, Ukraine, amid heavy casualties, but there has been little recent movement on the battlefield.', 'At the Group of 20 meeting, Russia and China, its strongest partner, blocked the foreign ministers from issuing a consensus communiqué at the end of the conference, arguing against lines that criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine.', 'Instead, the group released a somewhat lower-level statement that reflected the fact that 18 of the 20 nations condemned the invasion, showing that even some countries with an officially neutral stance — India, Indonesia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia among them — were willing to tilt against Russia in some settings. At a meeting in Bali in November, President Biden and other Group of 20 leaders agreed to a document with the same critical language.', 'Russian officials said Mr. Blinken had sought out the meeting with Mr. Lavrov, although Mr. Blinken told reporters a day earlier, before he flew from Uzbekistan to India, that he had no plans to meet at the conference with Mr. Lavrov or Mr. Qin. Mr. Blinken did not meet with his Chinese counterpart on Thursday.', 'The meeting between Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Blinken does not signal any movement toward starting talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said that “there were no negotiations” between the two men, according to Interfax, a Russian state news agency.', 'On Wednesday, Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, that the Biden administration saw “zero evidence” that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was serious about beginning substantial negotiations.', 'In reality, he said on Thursday, Mr. Putin is “doubling down on his brutalization of Ukraine.” Mr. Blinken reiterated that Mr. Putin was the one person who could meet the conditions for peace — by fully withdrawing from Ukraine.', 'President Biden and his aides say their goal for now is to keep giving Ukraine military aid to repel Russia and take back Ukrainian territory, and that any peace talks, an idea that China and a few other nations are pushing, are a distraction to help Mr. Putin try to solidify his gains and continue his assaults in Ukraine. Mr. Blinken told Mr. Lavrov that the United States was committed to defending Ukraine “for as long as it takes,” a senior State Department official said.', 'There was no indication that Mr. Lavrov addressed Mr. Blinken’s demands. But at a United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, a Russian official repeated Moscow’s reasons for suspending participation in the New START treaty. The Russian envoy, Sergey Ryabkov, accused the United States and its European allies of trying to “strategically defeat” Russia and of aiding Ukraine in order to attack Russian strategic sites identified under the treaty.', 'Mr. Blinken brought up the war in other private meetings during the conference. When he spoke with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, the two “discussed how to mitigate the global impacts of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine” and “the United States and India’s cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,” the State Department said in a statement. The second phrase is a reference to strategic efforts in Asia, including military coordination, to counter China.', 'But Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, who has been proud of his ability to bring the series of Group of 20 meetings to his country this year, expressed some disappointment that the war was dominating the conversations. His comment was a sign of weariness with the war and its impact across the globe.', 'In an opening video address to the diplomats, Mr. Modi said that while he understood that discussions “are affected by the geopolitical tensions of the day” — a clear reference to the war — he hoped the participants would keep the focus on global crises affecting the many developing nations of the world. He cited economic downturns, climate change and the pandemic.', 'Mr. Modi and other leaders in Asia and Africa have expressed growing frustration over the economic effects of the war, including surging food and energy prices. Mr. Blinken heard about some of those concerns during his visits this week to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan — the first by any Biden cabinet official to the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, which Moscow sees as within its sphere of influence.', 'The Group of 20 officials, including Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Qin, did all agree to language in the final declaration saying the countries would try to improve and continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allows cargo ships carrying Ukrainian grain to pass through a Russian naval blockade. The blockade had contributed to food shortages and rising prices around the world, which eased after the deal, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, took effect in July.', 'That agreement expires in March, but Mr. Lavrov’s consent to the statement about it in the declaration hinted that Moscow might agree to renew it. However, U.S. officials say Russia is still slowing the shipments by hobbling inspections that occur when the ships reach Istanbul.', 'Since the war began, the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, has spoken by phone a few times with Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu. But Mr. Blinken and Mr. Lavrov have had just one such call, last summer, about a U.S. government offer to Russia to free Mr. Whelan and Brittney Griner, Americans who the Biden administration says were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned in Russia.', 'In December, the United States released Viktor Bout, an imprisoned Russian weapons dealer, in exchange for Ms. Griner, a basketball star sentenced to nine years in a labor camp for cannabis possession. The Biden administration has continued to press Russia to free Mr. Whelan.', 'Mr. Blinken and Mr. Lavrov have been in other international meetings together and sat in the same room over the past year. But they have usually avoided each other, as they did at a Group of 20 meeting last summer in Bali, Indonesia, and at a meeting of foreign ministers of Southeast Asian nations and partners in Cambodia.', 'Last month, at a meeting in India of Group of 20 finance ministers, the U.S. Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, confronted Russian officials in a group meeting and said they had a “moral imperative” to end the war. She also told them they were “complicit in Putin’s atrocities.”', 'At the Thursday news conference, Mr. Blinken repeated his warning that China was considering supplying weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. He said officials from U.S. allies and partner nations had confronted Chinese counterparts over this, including here at the New Delhi conference. And he said the United States and those countries could impose economic sanctions “of various kinds” if China were to send weapons.', 'The top diplomats from a partnership of Asia-Pacific nations called the Quad — the United States, India, Japan and Australia — are scheduled to meet on Friday.

It does not have to be something as serious as abetting the Russian military.

Despite Mr. Biden’s pledge, the Ukrainian government has grown concerned enough that President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to set up a telephone call with Speaker Kevin McCarthy to make his country’s case.', 'Overall, public support for Ukraine aid has fallen from 60 percent last May to 48 percent now, according to surveys by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The share of Americans who think the United States has given too much to Ukraine has grown from 7 percent a year ago to 26 percent last month, according to the Pew Research Center.', 'And even supporters make clear their commitment is not without bounds. While 50 percent of those surveyed by Fox News said American support should continue for “as long as it takes to win,” 46 percent said the time frame should be limited.', '“It’s this way with every foreign intervention,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist who has advised two outspoken Republican voices against Ukraine aid, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Donald Trump Jr. “In the first few months, it’s always popular. People don’t like what Russia did; it’s awful. But as time goes on, war weariness is a real thing, especially in this country, especially when voters aren’t connecting what’s happening in Ukraine with their own security.”', 'Although skepticism of Ukraine aid has grown on both sides of the aisle, the party breakdown has been striking. According to Pew, 40 percent of Republicans think too much has been given compared with 15 percent of Democrats. The good news for Mr. Biden is that Americans have grown more supportive of his handling of the war, with 48 percent approving of his response to the invasion in the Fox poll compared with 40 percent in August.', 'While Mr. Biden used his visit to Kyiv and a follow-up stop in Warsaw to express solidarity with the Ukrainians, he has talked less about the war to fellow Americans while at home. He made a relatively passing reference to the war during his State of the Union address and has focused mainly on domestic priorities in recent campaign-style stops around the country. In part, that may be intended to deflect criticism that he cares more about foreigners than Americans.', 'Aides said Mr. Biden’s speeches in Kyiv and Warsaw were intended for an American audience as well as international ones. But the president has shrugged off concerns about ebbing public support for the Ukraine supply effort, suggesting it is relegated mainly to what he calls MAGA Republicans, after former President Donald J. Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan.', 'When David Muir of ABC News noted in an interview last week that many Americans were asking how long they could keep spending on Ukraine, the president quarreled with the premise. “I’m not sure how many are asking that,” Mr. Biden said. “I know the MAGA crowd is. The right-wing Republicans are talking about, we can’t do this. We find ourselves in a situation where the cost of walking away could be considerably higher than the cost of helping Ukraine maintain its independence.”', 'John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said support remains powerful in Congress itself. “Yes, there are a small number of members on Capitol Hill, in the House Republicans specifically, that have expressed publicly their concerns about support for Ukraine,” he said at a recent briefing. “But if you talk to the House leadership, you won’t hear that. And you certainly aren’t going to hear it on the Democratic side. And you don’t hear it in the Senate.”', 'Indeed, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and key House Republicans like Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have pushed Mr. Biden from the other side, arguing that the president is not doing enough for Ukraine. Mr. McCaul took a congressional delegation to Kyiv shortly after Mr. Biden, emphasizing bipartisan support.', 'But Mr. McCarthy, who during last fall’s campaign said there would be no “blank check” for Ukraine in a Republican House, is under pressure from a small but vocal part of his caucus critical of American involvement in the war and encouraged by Fox’s Tucker Carlson. With a razor-thin working majority, it is not clear whether he would allow another robust aid package to come to the floor for a vote and if so under what conditions, which is why Mr. Zelensky wants to talk, as was reported by Punchbowl News.', 'Among those pushing Mr. McCarthy to block future aid is Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, the former QAnon adherent who has become a key ally since helping him win the speakership. Speaking to Just the News, a conservative website, this week, Ms. Greene said she opposed the war in Ukraine. “But you know who’s driving it?” she asked. “It’s America. America needs to stop pushing the war in Ukraine.”', 'While she and her allies have been on the margins of the Republican Party on Ukraine, the center of gravity may be shifting. Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Biden last week for visiting Kyiv instead of East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a recent toxic train derailment. In a fund-raising video, Mr. Trump said, “we’re teetering on the brink of World War III” thanks to Mr. Biden and promised to “end the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours.”', 'Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, his most formidable potential challenger for the 2024 nomination, sought to match Mr. Trump, criticizing what he called the “open-ended blank check” for Ukraine and saying “I don’t think it’s in our interest” to be involved in the fight for territory seized by Russia.', 'By contrast, the announced and unannounced Republican presidential candidates who do support aid to Ukraine, like former Vice President Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, trail far behind those two front-runners.', 'Mr. Surabian said a rematch between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump would sharpen the nation’s debate over Ukraine. “If Donald Trump is the nominee, I 100 percent expect him to prosecute the case against Biden directly on the Ukraine issue,” he said. “I think this will become a centerpiece issue between him and Biden.”', 'So far, Congress has approved $113 billion in military, economic, humanitarian and other aid for Ukraine, not all of which has been spent yet. Anticipating trouble from the new Republican House, the White House and lame-duck Democratic majority last winter pushed through an aid package large enough to last until summer. At the current rate of spending, it would run out by mid-July, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.', 'A House Democrat who asked not to be identified speaking critically of the White House expressed concern that the president’s team did not fully grasp how Americans viewed the aid. While they support Ukraine in principle, this Democrat said, the way the aid has been doled out through a steady drumbeat of announcements of another $500 million or $1 billion every week or two exacerbates the sense that endless funds are heading out of the country.', 'Philip D. Zelikow, a University of Virginia scholar and former State Department counselor, said military aid was more popular than economic aid because much of it is actually spent on arms produced by American defense firms. But he said that economic aid was critical to rebuilding Ukraine, and he argued that seizing $300 billion in Russian assets in the West for reconstruction would ease the burden on the American taxpayer.', '“I’m critical of the administration because it did not start moving at least six months ago to design a more sustainable and hopeful strategy on what will likely be the decisive battlefield of the war,” he said.', 'Still, some government veterans said there is only so much Mr. Biden can do to preserve public support since the most pronounced erosion has been on the Republican side.', '“President Biden probably has limited ability to reach the Republican audiences that are most in play,” said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University professor who has studied the relationship between public opinion and military operations and advised President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. “He has a daunting but perhaps doable task to keep his left flank on board.”', 'The uncertainty about whether Mr. McCarthy’s House will approve further aid may influence how Mr. Biden spends the money already allocated as Ukraine and its supporters press for more expensive, high-powered weaponry that would drain the existing funds and force a new vote earlier.', '“If you add Patriots, F-16s, long-range missiles and all these other things to the mix, then by definition the moment of truth comes sooner,” said former Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey and a strong supporter of Ukraine. “And I’m not sure if the proponents of those things on the Hill have a plan yet to overcome the inevitable MAGA resistance in the House. And if they don’t, it’s logical for Biden to husband the resources that he has and focus on the things that Ukraine needs the most, like ammunition.”', 'Others like Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the uncertainty is all the more reason for the president to be aggressive and help the Ukrainians win the war sooner before public support fades further.', '“The problem is that the longer the war continues, the greater the risk that U.S. resolve will wane, no matter how much effort the president puts into convincing Americans to stay the course,” she said. “That’s why it’s so critical that the United States lean in now and help Ukraine end things militarily.”', 'She added, “If U.S. support wanes over time, it is quite possible that we end up in the worst possible world in which Russia snatches a victory from the jaws of defeat.”']"

Perhaps no weapon symbolizes the ferocious violence of war more than the main battle tank. Tanks have loomed over the conflict in Ukraine in recent months — militarily and diplomatically — as both sides prepared for offensives. Russia pulled reserves of tanks from Cold War-era storage, and Ukraine prodded Western governments to supply American Abrams and German Leopard 2 tanks.', 'The sophisticated Western tanks are expected on the battlefield in the next several months. The new Russian armor turned up earlier — and in its first wide-scale deployment was decimated.', 'A three-week battle on a plain near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar in southern Ukraine produced what Ukrainian officials say was the biggest tank battle of the war so far, and a stinging setback for the Russians.', 'In the extended battle, both sides sent tanks into the fray, rumbling over dirt roads and maneuvering around tree lines, with the Russians thrusting forward in columns and the Ukrainians maneuvering defensively, firing from a distance or from hiding places as Russian columns came into their sights.', 'When it was over, not only had Russia failed to capture Vuhledar, but it also had made the same mistake that cost Moscow hundreds of tanks earlier in the war: advancing columns into ambushes.', 'Blown up on mines, hit with artillery or obliterated by anti-tank missiles, the charred hulks of Russian armored vehicles now litter farm fields all about Vuhledar, according to Ukrainian military drone footage. Ukraine’s military said Russia had lost at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers in the battle. That figure could not be independently verified. Ukraine does not disclose how many weapons it loses.', '“We studied the roads they used, then hid and waited” to shoot in ambushes, Sergeant Knignitsky said.', 'Lack of expertise also bedeviled the Russians. Many of their most elite units had been left in shambles from earlier fighting. Their spots were filled with newly conscripted soldiers, unschooled in Ukraine’s tactics for ambushing columns. In one indication that Russia is running short of experienced tank commanders, Ukrainian soldiers said they captured a medic who had been reassigned to operate a tank.', 'The Russian army has focused on, and even mythologized, tank warfare for decades for its redolence of Russian victories over the Nazis in World War II. Factories in the Ural Mountains have churned out tanks by the thousands. In Vuhledar, by last week Russia had lost so many machines to sustain armored assaults that they had changed tactics and resorted only to infantry attacks, Ukrainian commanders said.', 'The depth of the Russian defeat was underscored by Russian military bloggers, who have emerged as an influential pro-war voice in the country. Often critical of the military, they have posted angry screeds about the failures of repeated tank assaults, blaming generals for misguided tactics with a storied Russian weapon.', 'Grey Zone, a Telegram channel affiliated with the Wagner mercenary group, posted on Monday that “relatives of the dead are inclined almost to murder and blood revenge against the general” in charge of the assaults near Vuhledar.', 'In a detailed interview last week in an abandoned house near the front, Lt. Vladislav Bayak, the deputy commander of Ukraine’s 1st Mechanized Battalion of the 72nd brigade, described how Ukrainian soldiers were able to inflict such heavy losses in what commanders said was the biggest tank battle of the war so far.', 'Ambushes have been Ukraine’s signature tactic against Russian armored columns since the early days of the war. Working from a bunker in Vuhledar, Lieutenant Bayak spotted the first column of about 15 tanks and armored personnel carriers approaching on a video feed from a drone.', '“We were ready,” he said. “We knew something like this would happen.”', 'They had prepared a kill zone farther along a dirt road that the tanks were rumbling down. The commander needed only to give an order over the radio — “To battle!” — Lieutenant Bayak said.', 'Anti-tank teams hiding in tree lines along the fields, and armed with American infrared-guided Javelins and Ukrainian laser-guided Stugna-P missiles, powered up their weapons. Farther away, artillery batteries were ready. The dirt road had been left free of mines, while the fields all about were seeded with them, so as to entice the Russians to advance while preventing tanks from turning around once the trap was sprung.', 'The column of tanks becomes most vulnerable, Lieutenant Bayak said, after the shooting starts and drivers panic and try to turn around — by driving onto the mine-laden shoulder of the road. Blown-up vehicles then act as impediments, slowing or stalling the column. At that point, Ukrainian artillery opens fire, blowing up more armor and killing soldiers who clamber out of disabled machines. A scene of chaos and explosions ensues, the lieutenant said.', 'Russian commanders have sent armored columns forward for a lack of other options against Ukraine’s well-fortified positions, however costly the tactic, he said.', 'Over about three weeks of the tank battle, repeated Russian armored assaults floundered. In one instance, Ukrainian commanders called in a strike by HIMARS guided rockets; they are usually used on stationary targets like ammunition depots or barracks, but also proved effective against a stationary tank column.', 'The Ukrainians also fired with American M777 and French Caesar howitzers, as well as other Western-provided weaponry such as the Javelins.', 'The Ukrainian tank crew that prayed before each battle nicknamed their tank The Wanderer, for its wandering movements around the battlefield. Between missions it remained hidden in trees under a camouflage net, beside a road churned into a panorama of mud by passing tanks, five miles or so from the front line.', 'During the battle for Vuhledar, Private Hrebenok, the commander, was ordered to drive forward from that spot on dangerous missions, three or four times per day. ', 'Private Hrebenok, only 20 years old, had no formal training in tank combat when the war started. But in the frantic first days of the war he was assigned to a tank, and has fought continuously in them since, picking up tricks along the way.', 'Training still looms as a problem. Ukraine, too, is losing skilled soldiers and replacing them with green recruits. And many Ukrainian tank crewmen are being trained on Western tanks in countries like Germany and Britain.', '“All my knowledge I gained in the field,” he said. The Russian tank crews, he said, are in contrast mostly new recruits without the benefit of any combat to season them.', 'In ambushes, the crew hides the tank within range of a road that Russian tanks or armored personnel carriers might travel down. Then it waits quietly. As they sit and prepare for ambush, they must keep the engine warm, because restarting it would take too long. Idling would be noisy. Instead, they burn a small kerosene heater beside the motor.', 'Once, while they were waiting, a Russian armored personnel carrier passed through their sight and they fired but narrowly missed, damaging but not destroying the machine.', 'In the last major engagement, a week ago, the order came in during the gray pre-dawn to prepare an ambush for a column of 16 Russian tanks and armored vehicles advancing toward the Ukrainian lines. The crew said their prayer, patted their tank and drove forward.', '“We hid the tank in a tree line and waited for them,” Private Hrebenok said. “It’s always scary but we need to destroy them.”', 'In this instance, they stopped about three miles short of the ambush site, just out of range of return fire, and shot in coordination with a drone pilot who called in coordinates on a radio for targets they could not see directly.', 'The Russian column stalled on mines and, Private Hrebenok said, The Wanderer opened fire. The Russian tank crews had little chance once they were in the kill zone, he said.', '“We destroyed a lot of Russian equipment,” he said. “What they did wrong was come to Ukraine.”']"

At NATO, European militaries are sometimes called “bonsai armies,” after the miniature trees.', 'For years, the United States has been nagging Europe to increase military spending, and in 2014, after Russia grabbed Crimea, NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Yet even today, by current NATO estimates, only nine of the alliance’s 30 members are spending that much, while a 10th is close. Thirteen countries, including Germany, were spending around 1.5 percent of their G.D.P. or even less.', 'In Germany, which for years clung to a foreign policy that emphasized aid and development more than hard power, some saw the problem as uniquely German. Yearly military reports to Parliament offered sometimes comical glimpses of the shortages. Commandos conducted water training at local public pools, because their own facilities were shut down. Planes could not fly. Soldiers trained with broomsticks instead of rifles. Even newer Puma infantry fighting vehicles recently broke down en masse.', 'But other European nations are now realizing their own militaries may have similar troubles.', '“The trend across the board in European armies has been cutting, cutting, cutting,”  said Christian Mölling, a defense expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “But at the end of the day, many were on the same track as Germany: War is a theoretical thing. So we have theoretical tanks.”', 'Spain, which has 108 Leopard 2A4 tanks, early on sought German permission to offer some of its vehicles to Ukraine. Now it has discovered that many of them are in poor condition and need refurbishment that could take weeks or months. On top of that, one of the prime minister’s coalition partners, the leftist Podemos party, is closer to Russia and has been resistant to offering more support for Ukraine.', 'Nevertheless, as Germany turned the pressure back on its allies for their shortcomings, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, on Friday improved on his promise to send six Leopards and said Spain would now send 10.', 'Ulrike Franke, a defense analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the struggle to find tank numbers raises questions as to where else European militaries face similar shortages and maintenance problems.', '“Is it just bad luck that Spain has an issue with their Leopard tanks, but everything else works?” she said. “Or do they have the same issues elsewhere?”', '“Does 10 percent of their equipment not work, or is it 50 percent?” Ms. Franke asked. “It would be a good idea for Europeans to look at this more closely.”', 'Poland, which has difficult relations with Germany, was foremost in pressing Mr. Scholz and Berlin on the Leopards, and even threatened to send some to Ukraine without the necessary German permission. Like Berlin, Warsaw has some 200 Leopard 2 tanks — but it says it will provide just 14. It sent the first of the tanks to Ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion, Feb. 24, although Poland has yet to finish training Ukrainian soldiers how to use them.', 'Warsaw may be holding off on deliveries of Leopards until it receives new Hyundai-made K2 tanks from South Korea, meant to replace the German model, some analysts said. Poland has sent many upgraded Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine.', 'But some European officials think Warsaw should be offering more Leopards, and some policymakers are planning meetings with Polish officials this week to better understand the situation. Even when it comes to the tanks that are in large supply — namely, the older Leopard 1 models — there are complications.', 'The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark have launched a joint initiative to refurbish and send 150 Leopard 1 models to Ukraine by the end of the year. But at a training session for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany earlier this week, one general said militaries had been forced to seek out retired Leopard 1 tank drivers to come back and help train Ukrainian forces. The old model is too unfamiliar to current militaries.', 'As politicized as the Leopard issue has become, Gustav Gressel, a security analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that there were plenty of solutions if European nations worked together.', 'The Dutch, for instance, lease 18 Leopards from Germany. Officials are discussing whether it would be possible for Germany to take some of them to use in place of its own Leopards in Lithuania and then send those to Ukraine.', 'Switzerland, sticking to its constitutional neutrality, refuses to send any of its 134 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. But it is willing to give the tanks to European Union members, Mr. Gressel said. Countries like Finland or Poland, he said, could request the Swiss tanks and send their own to Ukraine.', 'Another option would be for countries to simply buy more Leopards, made by the German companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and send their current models to Ukraine. But European governments and the defense industry are currently in a standoff over production.', 'State leaders want industry to move first, while weapons makers want longer-term government orders before they step up production. If more government orders are made, analysts say, the more capacity may increase, thus speeding up production of weapons like tanks.', 'At current rates, militaries would face a serious tank shortage for the two to three years it would take the industry to make the new vehicles, security experts say — a long waiting period politicians across Europe are learning their armies are fiercely resistant to accept.', 'That is why Mr. Gressel argued the tanks should be sent now anyway.', '“Yes,” he said, “Russia will reconstitute itself as a military threat to NATO after this war. But it will take years for them to come back as a military threat. They have to rebuild an army which is shattered and almost destroyed in Ukraine.”']"

U.S. officials have said in recent days that Beijing may be preparing to give weapons and ammunition to Russia, and on Sunday President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Washington was “watching closely.”', '“We know they haven’t taken it off the table,” Mr. Sullivan told ABC’s “This Week.” “And we are sending a clear message, as are our European allies, that this would be a real mistake because those weapons would be used to bombard cities and kill civilians, and China should want no part of that.”', 'At the same time, Kyiv’s allies have stressed their commitment to backing Ukraine for the long haul against Russia’s invasion — pledging in recent days to provide even more weapons and military support.', 'Ukraine will wait for more of those weapons to arrive before launching a counteroffensive in the south that aims to cut off the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from other territory that Moscow has seized, according to Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy intelligence chief.', '“I believe we will be ready for a counteroffensive this spring,” Mr. Skibitsky was quoted as saying in an interview with the German news outlet Deutsche Welle that was published on Sunday.', 'Any such offensive would likely push toward the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, where Ukraine in recent weeks has targeted Russian forces with long-range strikes and sabotage attacks. ', 'Mr. Skibitsky’s remarks about cutting off Crimea came on a symbolic day for Ukraine, the ninth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the peninsula, which it then annexed illegally. The U.S. State Department described Russia’s claiming of the territory as “a clear violation of international law” in a statement on Sunday. “The United States does not and never will recognize Russia’s purported annexation of the peninsula,” a department spokesman, Ned Price, said. “Crimea is Ukraine.”', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly said that reclaiming Crimea is necessary to restoring sovereignty over all of Ukraine’s territory.', '“By returning Crimea, we will restore peace,” he said on Sunday in a post on Telegram. “This is our land. Our people. Our history. We will return the Ukrainian flag to every corner of Ukraine.”']"

Only the cold face of war is visible.”', 'The Finnish head of state, in office for more than a decade, had met with President Vladimir V. Putin many times, in line with a Finnish policy of pragmatic outreach to Russia, a country with which it shares a nearly 835-mile border. Suddenly, however, that policy lay in tatters, and, along with it, Europe’s illusions about business as usual with Mr. Putin.', 'Those illusions were deep-rooted. The 27-nation European Union was built over decades with the core idea of extending peace across the continent. The notion that economic exchanges, trade and interdependence were the best guarantees against war lay deep in the postwar European psyche, even in dealings with an increasingly hostile Moscow.', 'That Mr. Putin’s Russia had become aggressive, imperialist, revanchist and brutal — as well as impervious to European peace politics — was almost impossible to digest in Paris or Berlin, even after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. An increasingly militaristic Russia might swim, quack and look like a duck, but that did not mean it was one.', '“Many of us had started to take peace for granted,” Mr. Niinisto said this month at the Munich Security Conference after leading Finland’s abrupt push over the past year to join NATO, an idea unthinkable even in 2021. “Many of us had let our guard down.”', 'The war in Ukraine has transformed Europe more profoundly than any event since the Cold War’s end in 1989. A peace mentality, most acute in Germany, has given way to a dawning awareness that military power is needed in the pursuit of security and strategic objectives. A continent on autopilot, lulled into amnesia, has been galvanized into an immense effort to save liberty in Ukraine, a freedom widely seen as synonymous with its own.', '“European politicians are not familiar with thinking about hard power as an instrument in foreign policy or geopolitical affairs,” said Rem Korteweg, a Dutch defense expert. “Well, they have had a crash course.”', 'Gone is discussion of the size of tomatoes or the shape of bananas acceptable in Europe; in its place, debate rages over what tanks and possibly F-16 fighter jets to give to Kyiv. The European Union has provided some $3.8 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.', 'Overall, European states, as part of the union or individually, have pledged more than $50 billion in various forms of aid to Kyiv, imposed 10 rounds of sanctions, absorbed more than eight million Ukrainian refugees (nearly the population of Austria), and largely weaned themselves off Russian oil and gas in a sweeping shift under acute inflationary pressure.', '“Zeitenwende,” or epochal turning point, is the term Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany used almost a year ago in a speech announcing a $112 billion investment in the German armed forces. He meant it for Germany, a country traumatized by its Nazi past into visceral antiwar sentiment, but the word also applies to a continent where the possibility of nuclear war, however remote, no longer belongs in the realm of science fiction.', 'The post-Cold War era has given way to an uneasy interregnum in which great-power rivalry grows. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia,” President Biden said this past week in Warsaw. He spoke as China and Russia held talks on their “no limits” partnership and Mr. Putin suspended Russian participation in the last surviving arms control treaty between the two biggest nuclear-armed powers.', 'It is the Age of Reordering, and Europe has been obliged to adjust accordingly.', '“The war has sent Europeans back to basics, to questions of war and peace and our values,” said François Delattre, the French ambassador to Germany. “It asks of us: Who are we as Europeans?”', 'In Mr. Putin’s telling, with his self-image as the macho embodiment of Saint Russia, Europeans were part of a decadent West, stripped of any backbone. He was wrong, one of several mistakes that have undercut a Russian invasion that was supposed to decapitate Ukraine within days.', 'Still, if Europe has held the line, its acute dependence on the United States — nearly 78 years after the end of World War II — has been revealed once more. America has armed Ukraine with weapons and military equipment worth some $30 billion since the war began, dwarfing the European arms contribution.', 'Without the United States, the heroic Ukraine of President Volodymyr Zelensky may not have had the military means to resist the Russian invasion. This is a sobering thought for Europeans, even if Europe’s response has exceeded many expectations. It is a measure of the work that still needs to be done if Europe is to become a credible military power.', 'So, as a long war looms along with a possibly protracted stalemate, the European Union will grapple with how to reinforce its militaries; how to navigate tensions between frontline states intent on the complete defeat of Mr. Putin and others, like France and Germany, inclined toward compromise; and how to manage an American election next year that will feed anxieties over whether Washington will stay the course.', 'In short, the war has laid bare the path before Europe: how to transform itself from peace power to muscular geopolitical protagonist.', '“Even if the war ends soon, there will be no going back,” said Sinikukka Saari, a Russia expert and research director at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Not on Finland’s decision to join NATO, and not to Europe’s status quo ante.', 'Before the war began last Feb. 24, the idea of a wealthy and complacent Europe, sapped by consumerism and bureaucracy, had gained traction as hard-line nationalists, often with financial and other links to Moscow, attacked the European Union.', 'But the Russian invasion has had a galvanizing and generally unifying effect. For Mr. Putin, the unintended and undesirable consequences of his war have multiplied.', 'Finland is a case in point. Its fears of Russia run deep. From 1809, for more than a century, it was part of the Russian Empire, albeit as an autonomous duchy. In World War II, it lost 12 percent of its territory to Moscow.', 'If compulsory military service was maintained throughout the postwar years, as most European countries abandoned conscript armies, it was not, as former Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said, “because we were afraid of Sweden.”', '“Every family has war memories, and history tells us of the danger,” said Emilia Kullas, the director of the Finnish Business and Policy Forum. “Yet we were hesitant. We thought being neutral served Finland best.”', 'Even last January, a month before the Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Sanna Marin, the Social Democratic prime minister, told Reuters it was “very unlikely” that Finland would apply to join NATO during her term. Opinion polls consistently showed that support for joining the alliance was no higher than 20 to 30 percent.', 'The curtain came down on all of that within days of the Feb. 24 attack. “Popular sentiment led the way,” said Janne Kuusela, the policy director at the Finnish Defense Ministry. “Usually, politicians change and people follow. This time, the people led.”', 'Finns saw their own Russia-plagued past in Ukraine’s suffering. They saw the impossibility of a workable relationship with the Putin regime. Old assumptions — that a strong defense ability, close cooperation with NATO and a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia could be combined — crumpled.', 'Support for NATO membership surged to over 70 percent. Finland was suddenly too small and too vulnerable to hold that long border.', 'Within three months, Finland, along with Sweden, had applied for NATO membership, a process expected to be completed by the next NATO summit, in July in Vilnius, Lithuania, although Turkish objections to Swedish membership persist over Sweden’s openness to Kurdish refugees.', 'Flanked by Magdalena Andersson, the Swedish prime minister, Finland had asked itself, “What is the line that Russia will not cross?” Ms. Marin recalled this month at the Munich Security Conference.', 'The answer was clear: “That is the NATO line.”', 'So much for Ms. Marin’s prior hesitations.', 'For Sweden, too, the choice had become evident, even for a country that has not fought a war for over 200 years.', '“The Baltic Sea has become a NATO pond,” said Thomas Bagger, the German ambassador to Poland. “That is a big strategic shift.”', 'Front lines have been drawn. The space in Europe for the places in between has disappeared. “There is no more room for gray zones,” said Mr. Korteweg, the Dutch defense expert. “That is why Zelensky wants to be in the E.U., and, if possible, NATO, as quickly as possible.”', 'This will not be easy. Ukraine was rapidly accorded formal candidate status to the European Union last year, but big problems, including endemic corruption and a weak judicial system, remain for a process that generally takes several years.', 'As for NATO membership, it seems inconceivable so long as Ukraine is at war with Russia.', '“I don’t think any NATO country thinks that a country fighting a war in Russia can join NATO,” said Petri Hakkarainen, the chief diplomatic adviser to Mr. Niinisto, the Finnish president.', 'Here lies a European dilemma that seems likely to grow. “A frozen conflict suits Putin,” said Mr. Delattre, the French ambassador to Germany. “A partially occupied, dysfunctional Ukraine cannot advance toward Europe. So of the three possible outcomes to the war — a Ukrainian victory, a Russian victory and a stalemate — two favor Putin.”', 'Of course, an increasingly repressive Russia under severe sanctions and a leader who is a pariah throughout the Western world, with no path to economic reconstruction, will also suffer from a prolonged conflict. But the limits to the Russian capacity to absorb pain are not easily discerned.', '“Russia is not willing to lose, and human life does not matter to Mr. Putin, so they can keep the war going for a long time,” Mr. Kuusela said. “Ukraine, in turn, will remain in the fight as long as the West supports it.”', 'He paused before concluding, “It will be a hard stalemate to break.”', 'The contrast between the post-World War II narratives of Poland and Germany, former enemies and still tense partners, is striking. Poland has never been less than acutely conscious of the Russian threat. Germany, racked by guilt, bought cheap Russian gas and waved away the threat of Mr. Putin.', 'Anti-German sentiment has swept Poland, which sees Berlin as too hesitant in its support of Ukraine, to the point that Germany’s supposed fickleness, at least in the eyes of the nationalist ruling party, is now a central theme of this year’s Polish parliamentary election.', 'European unity in the face of the war does not mean fissures have disappeared. Nowhere has the war in Ukraine been more challenging or transformative than in Germany.', 'In Poland — a nation held captive in the totalitarian Soviet imperium for decades before leading the struggle to break those chains and rejoin Europe — ideas of heroism and sacrifice endured. By contrast, a thoroughly post-heroic Germany, healing slowly from the Nazi horror, was unable to imagine the idea of a just war.', '“Now in Germany, we have discovered a Ukraine fighting a just war, and a reinterpretation of the post-1945 lessons is underway,” said Mr. Bagger, the ambassador. “It involves changes of policy in defense, in energy, but, at the deepest level, a change in mentality.”', 'The most powerful country in Europe, Germany has had to reimagine itself overnight, abandoning a peace culture by arming itself and Ukraine in the name of a war for European freedom. It has had to eliminate its dependence on Russia for 55 percent of its gas. It has been forced to contemplate a partial decoupling from China, an enormous market for German cars, to reduce its strategic vulnerability.', 'To Mr. Bagger, it appears that “Germans had internalized the wrong lessons from 1989 and the fall of the wall.”', 'They had convinced themselves that West German “Ostpolitik” or, loosely, détente, toward Moscow, had been the key to winning the Cold War and achieving reunification. In fact, President Ronald Reagan’s determination to deploy Pershing II and cruise missiles in West Germany, beginning in 1983, was critical.', '“The peaceniks of the Social Democratic Party did not win the day alone,” he said.', 'A central question for Europe is how effective the German transformation will be. Can Germany at last match its economic might with military heft, and how, in the end, will the rest of Europe feel about that?', 'Mr. Scholz, the Social Democratic chancellor, is a prudent politician, determined to avoid escalation of the war, acutely aware of lingering German anxiety over militarism. Like President Emmanuel Macron of France, who this month warned of the dangers of “crushing” Russia, he leans toward the need for peace talks.', 'His hesitancy was evident in the long debate over providing Leopard tanks to Ukraine, finally approved last month. Annalena Baerbock, the Green Party foreign minister, is more hawkish, inclined toward pursuit of a complete victory over Mr. Putin. “We are in a war against Russia,” she said last month. The tensions between her and Mr. Scholz have been evident.', 'They will persist. So, too, will tensions between a Germany intent on moving in lock step with the United States, as was clear in the tank debate, and Mr. Macron’s France.', 'Mr. Macron sees Europe’s military dependency on Washington as further proof of the need for “strategic autonomy” — a phrase many nations closer to the Russian border, like Finland, reject in favor of “strategic responsibility” because they want no hint of decoupling from the United States.', 'A year into the war in Ukraine, Europe finds itself at the outset of a difficult journey toward that strategic responsibility. Credible deterrence won the Cold War, but credible deterrence eroded sharply in its aftermath as defense budgets were cut.', '“Europe took a holiday from defense for 30 years,” said Mr. Kuusela, the Finnish defense official. Still there are many Europeans, in Italy and elsewhere, who believe sending arms to Ukraine is a mistake.', 'At a minimum, an alliance determined to deny Mr. Putin victory will have to be in a position to secure the Ukrainian sovereignty and independence that Russia is determined to quash.', '“We will not have sustainable peace in Europe unless there is credible deterrence in Europe, said Ms. Saari, the Finnish Russia expert. “That is the bottom line.”', 'For Finland and Sweden, that deterrence cannot be less than NATO membership. For Europe and the United States, the question in the coming years will be how to assure Ukraine of equivalent security and ironclad defense against Russia, short of NATO membership. That difficult debate is underway, but far from resolution.', '“We have to come to terms with the fact the world has changed,” said Mr. Hakkarainen, the adviser to the Finnish president. “The change in us must be material and mental. We need to make it quickly and sustain it.”', 'Mr. Putin’s war has cast an ominous shadow across the Europe “whole and free” of which President George H.W. Bush spoke in 1989, with “borders open to people, commerce and ideas.”', 'The line of fracture is not as hard as the Berlin Wall once was, and it is farther east, but it is there.', 'There is no mistaking it at Vaalimaa, the crossing on the Finnish-Russian border about halfway between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. Once notorious for its long lines, it is today a ghostly place. Its multilane approaches are empty, its vast nearby shopping emporiums deserted.', 'No longer a place of connection, it speaks of new European division.', 'With travel from Russia severely restricted by the Finnish government, a few people trickled across the border in the early-morning winter mist this month. I fell into conversation with Aleksandra Scherbakova, a Russian resident in the Netherlands, who had come from a visit to her 78-year-old father in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk.', '“He is suffering from dementia, so I try to see him when I can,” she said. “All anyone wants is love and family.”', 'Her own family story is difficult, as is often the case when war cuts hard lines through emotional bonds. Her father grew up in Lviv, then part of the Soviet Union and now a major city in an independent Ukraine.', 'Ms. Scherbakova took out her phone to show me a video of her ailing father, in Siberia, singing the Ukrainian songs of his youth with her during her recent visit. At the same time, she has Ukrainian cousins in Lviv who are now refugees in Poland.', 'So this Russian woman who has long had a job selling cosmetics at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam finds herself tugged in various directions in a Europe adapting to a war in its midst.', '“I have no idea when the war will be over,” she said as she boarded a bus to Helsinki Airport. “All I know is that it is such a waste.”', 'Beside her stood two Russians, Keivan Shakeri and Ibrahim Rastegavi, Iranians who moved to Russia decades ago to study and stayed on. They had used their Iranian passports to get two-year visas enabling them to enter Finland. It is now easier for an Iranian than a Russian to enter the European Union.', '“Life in Russia is boring, bad and difficult,” Mr. Rastegavi said. “You can start a war, but it’s not easy to finish.”']"

Yellen urged her counterparts at a summit in India to condemn Russia’s actions, and she defended the cost of supplying aid to Kyiv.","['A year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war is deepening the division among the world’s major economies, threatening fragile recoveries by disrupting food and energy supply chains and distracting from plans to combat poverty and restructure debt in poor countries.', 'Those fissures were evident this past week as top economic policymakers from the Group of 20 nations gathered for two days at a resort in Bengaluru, a city in southern India, where efforts to demonstrate unity were overshadowed by flaring tensions over Russia. During the summit, Western nations imposed a barrage of new sanctions on Moscow and unveiled more economic support for Ukraine, while developing countries like India, which have been reaping the benefits of cheap Russian oil, resisted expressing criticism.', 'The differing views left officials struggling to cobble together the traditional joint statement, or communiqué, on Saturday, forcing senior representatives from the Group of 7 nations, the world’s most advanced economies, to try to convince reluctant counterparts that defending Ukraine was worth the cost.', 'A summary of the meeting issued in the afternoon noted that “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine” but that “there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.” The statement noted that Russia and China refused to sign on to the parts of the summary that referred to the war in Ukraine.', 'In a clear sign of the tensions surrounding the discussion, the statement said that the Group of 20 was “not the forum to resolve security issues,” but that members “acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.”', 'Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Saturday in an interview that she had tried to make the case for a joint response to the more reluctant countries. “Ukraine is fighting not only for their country, but for the preservation of democracy and peaceful conditions in Europe,” she said, adding, “It’s an assault on democracy and on territorial integrity that should concern all of us.”', 'The summit took place at a pivotal moment for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its global output projections but warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine continued to cast a cloud of uncertainty. The fund also noted that increasing “fragmentation” in the world could be a drag on growth in the future.', 'Ms. Yellen was among the most forceful critics of Russia during the two-day meeting. At one point, she directly confronted senior Russian officials in a private session and called them “complicit” in the Kremlin’s atrocities.', 'The grappling over how to characterize Russia’s actions led Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, to publicly vent his frustration with some countries that would not assail Russia in writing. He noted that when the leaders of the Group of 20 nations met in November, in Bali, Indonesia, their statement had asserted that most members strongly condemned the war, and he said on Friday that he was opposed to watering down that sentiment.', '“I want to make it very clear that we will oppose any step back from the statement of the leaders in Bali on this question of the war in Ukraine,” Mr. Le Maire, who declined to name the holdouts, said at a news conference. “We strongly condemn this illegal and brutal attack against Ukraine.”', 'India’s close economic ties with Russia have made its role as the host of the Group of 20 this year especially challenging. Moscow is a major supplier of energy and military equipment to India, while the United States is India’s largest trading partner.', 'To remain neutral, India has tried to avoid describing the conflict as a “war” and instead focused on other issues. In an opening address to the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid out the threats facing the global economy, but he made no mention of Russia, pointing instead to “rising geopolitical tensions in many parts of the world.”', 'Some of the resistance to condemning Russia is because of concern about the United States’ use of its economic might to isolate a member of the Group of 20.', '“The fact that the U.S. clearly has so much power to take action against a geopolitical rival is a significant concern,” said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University who speaks to both American and Indian officials. “There’s clearly been a splintering of the G20.”', 'Mr. Prasad added that the aggressive use of sanctions by the United States had raised anxiety among other nations — even if they disagreed with Russia’s actions — that they could someday be exposed to Washington’s wrath.', 'That use of economic warfare was on display on Friday, when the United States imposed sanctions on more than 200 individuals and entities in Russia and other countries that are helping to financially support Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions were also placed on Russia’s metals and mining sector and on energy companies.', 'The war in Ukraine was not the only matter this past week that consumed finance ministers in India.', 'The United States and Europe continued to hash out differences over American subsidies for electric vehicles that European countries believe will harm their economies. A global tax agreement that was struck in 2021 continues to flounder, raising the prospect that it could unravel. And talks over restructuring debt burdens facing poor countries to avoid a cascade of defaults failed to bear fruit, largely because of resistance from China.', '“There hasn’t been a significant change that I see,” said Ms. Yellen, who expressed frustration at China’s role as a roadblock this past week.', 'But it is the war in Ukraine that has left the world’s economic leaders most divided. In many cases, resistance to supporting Ukraine and confronting Russia is the result of complicated domestic politics in many countries, and the United States is no exception.', 'A growing number of Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump, have been arguing in recent weeks that the United States cannot afford to endlessly support Kyiv. They contend that at a time when the United States is burdened by record levels of debt and a weakening economy, that money would be better spent on domestic problems.', 'In the past year, the United States has directed more than $100 billion dollars of humanitarian, financial and military aid to Ukraine. The Congressional Budget Office projected last week that the United States was on track to add nearly $19 trillion to its national debt over the next decade, $3 trillion more than previously forecast.', 'For the Biden administration, scaling back aid to Ukraine does not appear to be an option.', 'In the interview, Ms. Yellen argued that the United States can afford to bear the costs and that supporting Ukraine was a priority for national security and economic reasons.', '“The war is having an adverse effect on the entire global economy,” Ms. Yellen said, “and providing the support that’s necessary for Ukraine to win this and bring it to an end is certainly something that we really can’t afford not to do.”']"

We have everything for it: motivation, belief, friends, diplomacy.”', 'China released an outline for a peace settlement that the West dismissed as a vague nonstarter that might serve only to cement into place Russian gains. The move came as the United States has been warning that Beijing might send weapons to Russia, which could dramatically alter the balance in a fight where both sides have run low on vital munitions.', 'Mr. Zelensky took care not to say anything that might provoke Beijing, the powerful Moscow ally that he hopes will remain largely on the sidelines of the war — continuing his long balancing act between condemning Russia while avoiding direct criticism of China. Asked about China on Friday, he said little about its proposal, and merely expressed hope that the country would not arm Russia.', 'On the prospects for peace talks, the warring nations continued to talk past one another, each setting preconditions that the other would call capitulation. The Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily A. Nebenzya, told the Security Council that his country would only negotiate on how its goals in Ukraine could be achieved.', 'Mr. Zelensky said that Russia must halt its violence against Ukraine and respect Ukrainian sovereignty before there could be any talks, and asked what negotiation was possible with a nation that continued to kill civilians.', '“Those civilians did not have guns in their hands, they had their children in their hands,” he said.', 'As the Security Council met in New York to discuss the war, protesters outside held up an effigy of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with bloodied hands. In Brussels, hundreds of people gathered in a cold drizzle outside the European Parliament to unfurl a giant Ukrainian flag, sing the Ukrainian national anthem and chant “Slava Ukraini,” or “Glory to Ukraine.” World leaders issued statements deploring the invasion and noting that a year of bloodshed and destruction had passed, with no end in sight.', 'In Buenos Aires, people gathered in front of the barricaded Russian embassy, playing Russian rock anthems on speakers and waving Ukrainian flags and bearing signs with messages like “Russia Without Putin.”', '“This war is a lie,” said Aleksandr Fitasov, 35, one of the event organizers in Buenos Aires. “It’s just to defend President Putin’s power, so he remains president, and to satisfy his empire ambitions to recreate the great Russia, with all the territories.”', 'Many of the protesters in Buenos Aires were among the thousands of Russians who have fled their country during the war, including some with babies born to parents who hoped that foreign birth certificates and passports would give their children brighter futures. Russian opposition groups say they have organized events in 100 cities in 44 countries over the next three days to protest the war.', 'Even in Russia, where dissent has been criminalized, there were scattered acts of protest on Friday, from the subtle to the unmistakable — and at least 20 arrests, according to rights groups. In a village near Saint Petersburg, Dmitri Skurikhin painted the names of cities Russia has ravaged on the facade of his store, and knelt outside with a sign saying “Forgive us, Ukraine” — acts that could get him five years in prison.', 'In a park in Moscow, a steady trickle of people laid flowers at a statue of the Ukrainian poet Larysa Kosach-Kvitka, better known as Lesya Ukrainka, while two police officers watched from a parked squad car nearby. “In order for Russia to become a free and democratic country, it must lose this particular war, in order for the government to change,” said one of the flower bearers, Nikolai, an 18-year-old student whose full name is being withheld for his safety.', 'In general, however,\xa0the mood in Moscow was one of business as usual, with many people saying that they had given little thought to the war, or to Russia’s isolation.', 'There was little news on Friday\xa0from the battlefield, where the war has already done damage beyond comprehension: hundreds of thousands killed or wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, cities and towns almost completely flattened, millions of Ukrainians made homeless, and millions more struggling through winter with insufficient shelter, heat or electricity — or even, in some cases, enough food and water.', 'The war has reverberated around the globe, reshaping and strengthening alliances, and affecting everything from grain prices to energy policy. But even though Russia has found itself more isolated from the West and sanctions have damaged the country’s economy, they have failed to bring it to its knees. China, India and others continue to trade with Moscow and provide it with diplomatic support.', 'Throughout the war, China has presented itself as neutral, even as it has aligned more closely with Russia. The proposal it released on Friday calls for peace talks and\xa0a cease-fire, though Russia still holds a large swath of Ukrainian territory in four provinces it claims to have annexed. It does not call for withdrawal of Russian troops.', 'Beijing repeated points it had made before, without naming any country as perpetrator or victim, in language broad enough to be open to interpretation. The Chinese statement calls for “respecting the sovereignty of all countries,” but does not address Mr. Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is not a real country\xa0and merely a temporarily estranged part of Russia.', 'And it calls for an end to sanctions imposed without approval from the Security Council, where Russia and China both hold veto power — a reference to the penalties the United States, the European Union and Britain have imposed on Russia.', '“Security is not an exclusive right enjoyed only by some countries,” Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official, told the Security Council.\xa0“The security of one country should not be pursued at the expense of others.”', 'Mr. Nebenzya, the Russian ambassador, praised the Chinese statement, while at the same meeting, Antony J.

Putin’s war.,"['WASHINGTON — President Biden marked the start of a second year of war in Europe on Friday by announcing billions of dollars in additional military aid for Ukraine, imposing more sanctions on those helping President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and delivering a grim warning about an alliance between Russia and Iran.', 'Just days after making a secret trip to Ukraine’s capital, Mr. Biden joined the leaders of the other Group of 7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain — in reaffirming his support for the beleaguered country and condemning Russia’s invasion a year ago.', '“A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase the people’s love of liberty,” Mr. Biden wrote in a statement on Twitter, alluding to Mr. Putin. “Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.”', 'The Biden administration announced economic sanctions on more than 200 individuals and entities in Russia and other countries that it says are supporting Moscow’s war. The Pentagon also said on Friday that it would spend $2 billion to supply the Ukrainian military with new drones and anti-drone systems, as well as additional ammunition for artillery and long-range rocket systems. In an interview with ABC News’s David Muir on Friday night, however, Mr. Biden said he was ruling out sending F-16 fighter jets “for now.”', 'Together, the efforts build on a more than yearlong campaign to leverage economic and military tools against Mr. Putin. But the prospect of sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies did not prevent the invasion, nor has their implementation forced the Russian leader to negotiate an end to his brutal war.', 'And on Friday, Mr. Biden’s administration said it sees growing evidence that Russia may be planning to provide Iran with fighter jets as part of a deepening military relationship, with implications for the Ukraine war and security in the Middle East.', 'John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, did not offer detailed intelligence evidence to support the accusation, but said U.S. officials believe that the possible provision of jets to Iran follows shipments of artillery rounds from Iran to Russia.', '“In November, Iran shipped artillery and tank rounds to Russia for use in Ukraine,” Mr. Kirby said. “And Russia is planning to cooperate with Iran to obtain even more military equipment. In return, Russia has been offering Iran unprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles, electronics and air defense.”', 'The announcement comes as the United States has warned that China may also be considering whether to provide military support to Russia.', 'On Friday evening, Mr. Biden said there was “no evidence of that so far.”', '“I had a long conversation with Xi about this in the summer,” he said, referring to President Xi Jinping of China. “I said, ‘Look this is not a threat, it’s just a statement. When, in fact, Europeans saw what was happening and Americans saw what was happening in Russia, in Europe, guess what? Six hundred corporations pulled out and left.’ I said, ‘You told me the future of China rests on investment from the Western world. That matters.’ I said I’d just keep an eye on it.”', 'The potential new support for Russia by Iran and China is among the far-reaching global ramifications of the yearlong war, which has reshaped alliances on both sides of the conflict.', 'The impact on the battlefield could be significant, Mr. Kirby said, if Iran is helping Mr. Putin get around the Western sanctions intended to cripple his ability to equip his forces. But Mr. Kirby noted that the partnership also raises concerns for the Middle East, where the delivery of Russian fighter jets to Iran could alter the power dynamic in the region.', 'The revelations about Iran’s potential dealings with Russia came as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressed the Group of 7 nations in a virtual gathering Friday morning.', 'Mr. Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that he had presented the leaders with detailed requests for more support in five areas as he tries to defend his country and reclaim territory seized by the Russians over the past year: weapons, sanctions, finances, justice and unity.', '“I thanked the partners for their unity and help during this year,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. “We withstood. We started to free our land from Russian evil. We are in a return of security to international relations. And we know that our coalition of defenders of freedom can become a coalition of winners in 2023.”', 'As Mr. Zelensky and the other leaders declared their unity, the United States announced a series of broad new actions aimed at helping Ukraine on the battlefield and increasing the economic pressure on Russia.', 'Officials at the Treasury Department said the sanctions would target more than 30 people and companies in countries outside Russia that are connected to the effort to evade existing prohibitions. They include the Moretti procurement network, a trading group run by Walter Moretti, a Swiss-Italian business executive, Treasury officials said.', 'Among the targeted companies are those helping to produce carbon fiber, which can be used in military equipment, the officials said.', 'Treasury officials said that Russians who have already been cut off from large, multinational banking systems have frequently tried to access their money through smaller banks. The new sanctions will target several smaller banks across the globe, the officials said.', 'The Commerce Department on Friday added 86 companies and organizations that it said had aided Russia’s war — or engaged in other activities contrary to U.S. national security interests — to a list that prevents them from buying certain U.S. products and technologies. Seventy-nine of the sanctioned entities are in Russia, while others are based in China, Canada, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the department said.', 'The department also placed restrictions on selling technology to Iran, following the discovery of Iranian drones on the Ukrainian battlefield.', 'White House officials said the United States would raise tariffs on about $2.8 billion worth of Russian metals, minerals and chemical products and that it would use tariffs to significantly increase costs for aluminum that is smelted or cast in Russia.', 'The arms and munitions announced Friday, unlike much of what America has previously shipped, will not come out of Defense Department stockpiles. Rather, the United States will buy the items from manufacturers and send them to Ukraine, a process that is intended to sustain Ukraine’s long-term military needs but delays deliveries by months or even years.', 'The United States provided about $54 billion in aid to Ukraine last year, much of it military assistance. In late December, Congress approved an additional $50 billion in Ukraine aid to be spent over the course of the year. Friday’s announcement was part of that more recent funding.', 'The latest offering includes Cyberlux K8, Switchblade 600, Altius-600 and Jump 20 drone systems, according to a Pentagon statement. It also includes additional ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS; 155-millimeter artillery rounds; munitions for laser-guided rocket systems; mine-clearing equipment; and communications gear.', '“Today’s solemn anniversary is an opportunity for all who believe in freedom, rules and sovereignty to recommit ourselves to supporting Ukraine’s brave defenders for the long haul — and to recall that the stakes of Russia’s war stretch far beyond Ukraine,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement that accompanied the aid announcement.', 'The State Department announced more than $10 billion in new nonmilitary aid to Ukraine, nearly all of it direct budgetary support for its government.

Putin and President Biden both insisted this week that they were committed to the fight. Mr. Putin prepared Russia for a long war to be waged “step by step,” while the American president said “we will not tire” in the quest to ensure a democratic Ukraine.', 'And in a news conference in Kyiv on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he was “certain” his country would win, calling victory inevitable.', 'But none of the leaders made it clear what an attainable victory might look like, while hitching their legacies to a war with no discernible end.', '“Putin is as committed as he’s ever been to his grand victory,” said Eugene Rumer, a former American intelligence officer and the director of the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “Ukrainians are as committed as ever to defeating Putin, even if it will be at a most terrible price.”', 'Declaring the resolve to fight on, however, is much easier than mustering the resources and support to do so. Ukraine, with a population less than a third that of Russia and an economy devastated by the invasion, is increasingly dependent on Western aid. Russia, facing sanctions and voluminous frontline casualties, depends on close ties and economic cooperation with China, as well as a populace and a ruling elite that remain willing to accept the pain caused by Mr. Putin’s war.', 'On the battlefield, Russia’s winter offensive has so far been underwhelming. Ukraine is widely expected to mount a spring offensive of its own, but is running low on ammunition and, Ukrainian officials say, is desperate for better weaponry. Mr. Zelensky faces the twin tasks of keeping his country’s morale high and maintaining the resolve of Western allies.', 'Of all Ukraine’s challenges, the latter is perhaps the most urgent. Having held onto Western support through the winter, when economic upheaval threatened to break the will of European countries making domestic sacrifices, leaders in Kyiv as well as Mr. Biden must work to maintain solidarity.', 'At the Munich Security Conference last weekend, the full-throated expressions of support for Ukraine rarely included specifics, and in the corridors, Western officials and analysts privately expressed less sanguine views about Ukraine’s ability to achieve its stated goal of full victory.', 'They spoke of anxiety about the length of the conflict, the sustainability of weapons supplies and the political cost of higher inflation and more expensive energy and food.', 'American and European leaders repeated in public that it was solely up to Ukraine to define the aims of the conflict and decide when it is ready to negotiate an end to it. But some analysts believe that the risk of escalation by Russia and the blowback effects on the global economy mean that it is in Washington’s interest to push Ukraine toward more realistic war aims and eventual negotiations with Moscow.', '“It is time for the United States and its allies to get directly involved in shaping Ukraine’s strategic objectives, managing the conflict and seeking a diplomatic endgame,” said Charles A. Kupchan, a former Obama administration official with the Council on Foreign Relations.', 'Senior American and European officials understand that they, too, have their own national interests that may not perfectly coincide with those of Kyiv — the main reason being that while NATO countries will supply the Ukrainians and train them, they will not fight alongside them.', 'The United States has also been carefully calibrating the weapons it supplies the Ukrainians, to try to ensure that NATO is not dragged into a larger war with Russia.', '“The problem is that the United States gives Ukraine enough to push the Russians back, but not enough to win,” said Angela E. Stent, a scholar specializing in Russian affairs at Georgetown University and the author of “Putin’s World.”', 'Mr. Putin, however, faces his own gap between rhetoric and reality. He describes a pro-Western Ukraine as a mortal threat — an “anti-Russia,” he said, again, in his state-of-the-nation speech on Tuesday — but he has not explained how the minuscule territorial gains that Russia’s grinding fighting is eking out will bring the rest of Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit.', 'The Russian leader still appears convinced that his victory will be sealed off the battlefield, betting that if he keeps up the fight long enough, Ukrainians will eventually tire of resistance and Western voters will rise up against their current leaders. Mr. Putin, the Carnegie analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said, thinks of his territorial conquest of Ukrainian lands as just part of a broader, multipronged conflict.', '“He wants a new architecture of international security,” she said. “He wants non-expansion of NATO. He wants capitulation by Kyiv. Grabbing Ukrainian regions is just in addition.”', 'Crucial signals about the future of the war will come most visibly on the battlefield. Moscow’s winter offensive has so far delivered only minor gains. A failed attack near the town of Vuhledar saw more of the Russian dysfunction that plagued its invasion early in the war. Ukrainian officials say Moscow’s stock of artillery and missiles is running low, and that morale remains a big problem.', 'But Mr. Putin, with little domestic pushback, has millions of Russians he can throw into battle, and American officials say that Russia is currently trying to persuade China to provide military support — an alarming scenario for Ukraine and its allies.', 'On paper, Russia’s size would appear to give it a growing advantage as the war drags on: It occupies one-tenth of the earth’s landmass, with some of its most prized natural resources.', 'Nevertheless, Mr. Putin will face hard decisions as he seeks to keep up the fight. He will need to weigh any potential escalation in his war effort against the potential pushback from China and India — critical economic partners for Russia.', 'And he will need to keep an eye on the potential for domestic instability, as he weighs whether to declare another draft ahead of a possible new offensive. His “partial mobilization” of 300,000 civilians last fall thrust Russia into its biggest domestic crisis since the war began, as tens of thousands of young men clogged airports and border crossings to escape being sent to the front.', 'Analysts believe that Mr. Putin will need to call up more forces in order to have a chance at substantial territorial gains on the battlefield. That has become even more apparent in recent weeks, as Russia has suffered some of its heaviest casualties of the war and its main alternative to conscription — convicts recruited from Russian prisons — has dried up.', '“They will need personnel replenishment,” said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation focusing on Russia. “It’s just a question of: Is it going to be small, rolling call-ups, or is it going to be another large batch? And that answer will depend on how far they think they can take an offensive.”', 'In the presidential administration building in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, Mr. Zelensky’s senior leadership has been huddling in offices spread across a labyrinth of hallways and secret corridors behind towering columns and sandbags. For Ukrainian officials, balancing military strategy with diplomatic reality has been a challenge since Mr. Zelensky emerged from his bunker a year ago to plead for Western allies to provide weapons and ammunition to beat back Russian invaders pressing in on the capital.', 'Officials in Kyiv have said that they do not think Russia can continue to sustain the losses of men and equipment at the rate it is currently being battered forever, and will try to find a way to pause the conflict by increasing international pressure for a cease-fire.', 'The Kremlin’s best chance of succeeding, Ukrainian officials say, is convincing Ukraine’s international partners that Kyiv cannot prevail.', 'The longer Russia occupies part of Ukraine, they say, the more it can cripple Ukraine physically, economically and psychologically while it rebuilds its own arsenal. So the faster that more powerful weapons like tanks, longer-range precision missiles, armored fighting vehicles and fighter jets are put in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, they add, the faster the war can be brought to an end.', 'Mr. Biden’s dramatic visit to Kyiv and the commitment of another $2 billion in military assistance made it clear that the American support critical for Ukraine’s survival would continue as Kyiv plans to go on the offensive in coming months.', '“The timing of weapons supplies from our partners” was a major concern, said Oleksiy Danilov, the head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council. “The longer it takes, the more people we lose.”', 'In a recent interview, Mr. Danilov noted the comparisons popping up in media outlets comparing Ukraine and Korea, raising the notion that a “38th Parallel,” akin to the line that divided North and South Korea, could be imposed in Ukraine.', 'But he dismissed such talk as Moscow-fueled propaganda.', 'In his news conference on Friday, Mr. Zelensky also rejected the idea of a settlement under current conditions. For there to be peace, he said, Russia must stop committing atrocities like “murdering Ukrainian children” and “bombing Ukrainian cities” and show that it can “respect the right of Ukrainians to live on Ukrainian land.”', '“Only then will we tell you the form we can use to put an end to the war,” he said.']"

When it was raised a second time, he said that working to ensure China did not arm Russia was one of his top priorities.', '“I really want to believe that China is not going to supply weapons to Russia,” he said. Such a move would not only cause problems for Ukraine, he said, but would raise the risks of a third world war, adding, “I want to believe China is going to side with the idea of peace and fairness.”', 'About an hour later, the subject of China came up again, this time from a Chinese journalist.', 'Why should countries as geographically distant from Ukraine as China side with Kyiv?', 'Mr. Zelensky had the question translated a second time and then engaged the reporter directly, telling her that it was not about geography or geopolitics but basic principles.', 'Does China believe that innocents should not be killed? That a nuclear power plant should not be occupied?

Far beyond the front lines, the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion have reordered lives and upended economies.', 'Here is a look at the war’s consequences in six key areas.', 'The war helped push global grain prices to record highs, given the importance of Russia and Ukraine as exporters of food crops including wheat. The United Nations warned that millions of people, especially in parts of Africa and the Middle East, were threatened with famine. In July, Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement to release millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine’s Black Sea ports because of a de facto Russian naval blockade. Although Russia briefly suspended its participation in the deal in October, the agreement has largely held, and global grain prices have returned to prewar levels.', 'The war unleashed the worst global energy crisis since the 1970s. Energy prices soared in many parts of the world as nations reduced or cut off their purchases of Russian fossil fuels. In Europe, gas bills nearly doubled and electricity costs spiked about 70 percent in the first six months of the war. European Union diplomats in December agreed on a $60-per-barrel limit on the price at which Russian oil can be traded outside the bloc in another bid to deprive Moscow of revenue for the war. But with global supplies tight, Russia has remained a dominant exporter, selling more oil and gas to China and India over the last year.', 'The global economy was just emerging from the pandemic, and the energy crisis and slower growth contributed to higher inflation. Soaring prices ate away at people’s savings and paychecks, causing real wages to fall in many countries and slashing purchasing power. High inflation has become a political headache for leaders in countries including the United States, France and Britain, with governments raising spending to ease the pain for families and businesses using price caps, subsidies and reduced taxes.', 'President Biden said this week in Warsaw that “NATO is stronger than it’s ever been.” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may have hoped his invasion would exacerbate divisions in NATO, but the alliance has been galvanized. Finland, which shares a border with Russia, abandoned its policy of neutrality and applied to join the alliance, as did Sweden. NATO leaders have said they expect that both will win approval, although Turkey has raised objections over Sweden’s treatment of Kurdish groups that Ankara regards as terrorists. In September, Ukraine applied to join, although its bid is considered a long shot.', 'More than eight million Ukrainians fled as refugees to other parts of Europe, particularly in the early stages of the war, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Another five million are estimated to be displaced inside Ukraine. The highest number of refugees, more than 1.5 million, are registered in Poland. At the same time, the war has enhanced the influence on the continent of Poland and the Baltic States, which have embraced stout defense of Ukraine and pushed for greater and faster supplies of military aid. Europe’s traditional leaders, France and Germany, struggled early on with the delicate task of reorienting their longstanding policies of a European security structure that included cooperation with Russia. ', 'China has walked a fine line during the war, calling for peace while refraining from criticizing Russia, an increasingly important partner. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, on a tour of Europe this week, told his Ukrainian counterpart that he did not want to see the war “prolonged and escalated.” At the same time, China is holding joint military drills with Russia and South Africa, and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to pay a state visit to Moscow in the spring. The Biden administration is watching closely for signs that China may cross the line into providing direct military support to Russia and has warned it against doing so, but Beijing has pushed back strongly against the U.S. accusations.']"

He did not know the man well — and might never get to. It was chilling, several people remember him observing grimly, to think that he might be talking with a dead man.', 'Mr. Biden was hardly the only one to assume that Mr. Zelensky might not survive the Russian onslaught, given the target the Kremlin had put on his back. But the American president was happy to be proved wrong — and surprised to discover, like the rest of the world, that Mr. Zelensky was more than a former comedian and tougher than anyone imagined.', 'By the time Mr. Biden made a dramatic unannounced visit to wartime Kyiv this week, the two had grown close enough to greet each other with the easy familiarity of old friends. “How are the children?” Mr. Biden asked. “It’s amazing to see you,” he added, perhaps still shocked that the Ukrainian president has escaped Russian efforts to kill him. Mr. Zelensky inquired about Jill Biden. “She’s doing well,” the president replied. “She’s still teaching.”', 'It has not always been so convivial. The two leaders have been on a remarkable journey together since the invasion one year ago on Friday, forging a partnership that is critical to the future of the international order but\xa0that at times has been fraught with friction, according to officials in both camps who asked not to be identified. Mr. Biden has secured $113\xa0billion in military and other aid to be delivered to\xa0Ukraine, but in their telephone calls it has never been enough for Mr. Zelensky, who presses for more, more, more, faster, faster, faster. It took months to develop a better understanding of each other and smooth over hard feelings.', 'It is, after all, a relationship of necessity but not of equals, one of mutual interests but disparate priorities. If Mr. Zelensky is a modern-day Winston Churchill, as admirers often say, then Mr. Biden finds himself assigned the role of Franklin D. Roosevelt before Pearl Harbor, mustering the so-called Arsenal of Democracy to arm European allies without drawing the United States directly into a war.', 'While Mr. Biden shares Mr. Zelensky’s goal of driving out Russian invaders, he worries about provoking President Vladimir V. Putin into escalating the war beyond Ukraine’s borders or into a nuclear conflict. Mr. Biden’s reluctance to provide the most advanced weaponry vexes Mr. Zelensky, but the Ukrainian has learned how to slowly wear down resistance to eventually get much of what he wants.', '“Both are really determined and strong leaders,” said Igor Novikov, a former adviser to Mr. Zelensky on American affairs. “When their interests align, it’s the best relationship ever. If there are misunderstandings or different points of view, emotions pop up. I classify it as a complicated relationship, not in the bad sense. But it’s complicated.”', 'The tension is inherent to their different positions and responsibilities. “There’s just a basic structural thing here that has nothing to do with the personalities of Biden or Zelensky,” said Michael A. McFaul, an ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama who is regularly in touch with Ukrainian leaders.', '“Zelensky is trying to save his country,” Mr. McFaul said. “There’s nothing worse than getting the reports at the end of the day about how many people have died. Nobody should be surprised that he wants more all the time. He believes, and I think he’s right, that this is the way this war ends.”', 'As for the American president, Mr. McFaul said, “Biden feels, rightly so, that he’s mobilized the world and he’s mobilized America and the Pentagon has done more than it’s ever done before, and he’s frustrated he doesn’t get more praise for that.”', 'As wartime allies go, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelensky are a historical odd couple, an 80-year-old career politician who became a pillar of his country’s political establishment and a 45-year-old satirist who once played a president on television but had never served in public office before being elected to lead his nation. Mr. Biden came of age during the Cold War and was first sworn into the Senate\xa0five years before Mr. Zelensky was born. Mr. Zelensky was 13 when his country emerged from the collapsing Soviet Union as an independent country.', 'Their relationship was burdened before they ever met. Shortly after Mr. Zelensky was elected in 2019, President Donald J. Trump pressured him\xa0to investigate Mr. Biden, a demand that led to impeachment. New to government, Mr. Zelensky felt burned, assuming the byzantine maneuvering was the norm for American politics and wary of where it left him when Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump.', 'It did not go unnoticed in Kyiv that Mr. Biden spoke by phone with Mr. Putin in January 2021, just six days after taking office, while Mr. Zelensky did not get a call until April. Mr. Biden did not even nominate an ambassador to Ukraine until a year later, two months after the Russian invasion. In summer 2021, while Mr. Biden met with Mr. Putin in Geneva, the Ukrainians lashed out at visiting American officials for not imposing sanctions\xa0on Germany over its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Russia.', 'By winter, as Russian troops gathered on the Ukrainian border and American intelligence concluded that Mr. Putin planned to invade, Mr. Zelensky remained skeptical of Mr. Biden’s public warnings.', 'When the Ukrainian leader decided to travel to the Munich Security Conference last February, Mr. Biden’s team advised him not to leave his country in case it was attacked. He attended anyway, rallying international support and returning before the invasion.', 'Biden administration officials privately also pressed Mr. Zelensky to develop a succession plan in case something happened to him because the Ukrainian Constitution only called for the speaker of Parliament to fill a vacancy and listed no one else in line.', 'On the night of the invasion, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelensky spoke by telephone. It was a harrowing moment for the young Ukrainian, who was in a capital facing a brutal assault. During his visit to Ukraine this week, Mr. Biden recounted their conversation.', '“You told me that you could hear the explosions in the background,” Mr. Biden recalled. “I’ll never forget that. And the world was about to change. I remember it vividly, because I asked you — I asked you next — I asked you: ‘What is there, Mr. President? What can I do for you? How can I be of help?’ And I don’t know that you remember what you said to me, but you said, and I quote: ‘Gather the leaders of the world. Ask them to support Ukraine.’”', '“And you said that you didn’t know when we’d be able to speak again,” Mr. Biden continued. “That dark night, one year ago, the world was literally, at the time, bracing for the fall of Kyiv — it seems like a lot longer ago than a year, but think back to that year — perhaps even the end of Ukraine.”', 'The Biden team assumed that Mr. Zelensky would either be killed or lead a government in exile. But clad in an olive green sweatshirt, he refused suggestions to leave Kyiv, angry that the Americans doubted Ukraine’s resolve.', 'Ukrainian officials spread the story that Mr. Zelensky rebuffed the suggestion with a memorable quote: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” The Biden team considers\xa0the story apocryphal, a former administration official said, but was impressed by the mythmaking, which is a common tool of war.', 'Less than a week after the invasion, Mr. Biden told television anchors at an off-the-record lunch that he saw no offramp to get Mr. Putin to stop. He said he believed Russia would be able to defeat Ukraine, taking major cities, and he expected many people to die, according to an account from in the room. The idea that Ukraine could beat the Russians “is not going to happen,” Mr. Biden said. He acknowledged that to occupy and control the country was a more daunting challenge, but believed that Mr. Putin’s only game plan was to topple Mr. Zelensky and set up a puppet government.', 'The assumption that Moscow would quickly\xa0win influenced a strategic decision by Mr. Biden that proved an enduring source of grievance with Mr. Zelensky. American officials feared sending sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine that might fall into Russian hands, much like in Afghanistan when Mr. Biden withdrew troops the previous year. So they were restrained in what they sent.', 'In what became regular conversations with Mr. Biden, however, Mr. Zelensky relentlessly pushed for more, often skipping lightly over the gratitude for what the Americans had provided and instead presenting a list of what they had not.', 'Mr. Biden bristled at the president of the United States being treated like a supply sergeant, according to administration officials, believing that such lists should be discussed by their aides while the two leaders focused on higher-level questions.', 'On at least one occasion last summer, as reported by NBC News, Mr. Biden lost his temper when he called to tell Mr. Zelensky about $1 billion in aid he had just approved only to have the Ukrainian leader immediately list what else he needed.', '“Zelensky learned early on that it was a mistake not to provide the list,” Mr. McFaul said. “He learned that the best way to get the system to work was to give the list. And Biden didn’t like it, absolutely.”', 'Mr. Zelensky’s approach stemmed from living in a capital under regular bombardment. “In Zelensky’s view, the weapons deliveries are appreciated but extremely slow,” Mr. Novikov said. “For those delays, we are paying with Ukrainian blood.”', 'Biden administration officials appreciated the strain Mr. Zelensky was under.', '“If I were in your position, I would be doing the exact same thing,” Mr. Biden would tell Mr. Zelensky, according to a senior official. In the early weeks of the war, the official said, Mr. Zelensky would sign off calls with Mr. Biden by saying, “This may be the last time I see you.”', 'But Biden officials\xa0privately appealed to Mr. Zelensky’s team to handle the phone calls differently. The situation improved once Bridget A. Brink, the new American ambassador, arrived last spring. And Mr. Biden has often given in to Mr. Zelensky, eventually agreeing to send HIMARS guided rocket launchers, a Patriot antimissile battery and M1 Abrams tanks, all of which he initially withheld.', 'The relationship has grown stronger in recent months. Mr. Zelensky’s\xa0splashy visit to Washington just before Christmas seemed to make an impression on Mr. Biden and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who calls himself the quartermaster of the Ukraine war\xa0and works closely with Andriy Yermak, Mr. Zelensky’s top adviser. And Mr. Biden’s return trip to Kyiv highlighted their solidarity as Mr. Zelensky thanked him profusely for help that will be “remembered eternally,” while pressing for additional weapons more gently.', '“At the beginning, it was a quite rocky relationship and there’s still a certain rockiness but less,” said John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine who has praised Mr. Biden for the aid but argues that it has been way too slow. “To this day, the administration still complains that the Ukrainians are ingrates — and that’s because they refuse to look critically at their own policy.”', 'Speaking by telephone from Kyiv, Mr. Herbst said Mr. Biden’s visit went a long way toward cementing the partnership with Mr. Zelensky — to a point. “I know the Ukrainians loved the visit,” he said. “Him being on the streets of Kyiv struck a real chord and demonstrated the support they wanted to see. But the elite are still asking, where’s the beef?”']"

Blinken, the secretary of state, made a similar move when he warned China’s top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, against providing weapons to Russia.', 'In a previous era, the warning might have remained private, at least for some time. But a new intelligence playbook honed just before and during the war in Ukraine has redefined how the United States uses its classified knowledge to undercut Russia and its partners.', 'The playbook is not just about naming and shaming Russia and its allies; it has become a powerful tool in the United States’ arsenal to try to stymie the Kremlin’s offensive by exposing Russia’s military plans and in aligning support for Kyiv’s war effort in allied capitals.', 'Ahead of Mr. Blinken’s meeting with Mr. Wang, the United States disclosed to allies intelligence normally held in tight secrecy. It included details about the ammunition and other weaponry China was considering providing Russia. Then Mr. Blinken shared the broad conclusion that China was considering giving military support to Russia publicly.', '“For the most part, China has been engaged in providing rhetorical, political, diplomatic support to Russia, but we have information that gives us concern that they are considering providing lethal support to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” Mr. Blinken told ABC News.', '“And it was important for me to share very clearly with Wang Yi that this would be a serious problem.”', 'The disclosure by Mr. Blinken was driven at least in part by the U.S. belief that public warnings and the declassification of additional intelligence about internal Chinese deliberations could still deter Beijing from delivering to Russia weapon systems to aid Moscow’s military campaign.', 'Some American officials insist that unlike Iran or North Korea — countries whose military support for Russia has been disclosed by U.S. officials — China cares about its international reputation. Because of its trade ties with Europe and the United States, which North Korea and Iran do not have, Beijing may be less willing to risk sanctions over weapon sales.', 'The effort to declassify intelligence to expose Russia began just over a year ago when the Biden administration was trying to convince some skeptical allies in Europe that Russia was poised to invade Ukraine. The administration’s new intelligence sharing strategy did not stop the Russian invasion, but it succeeded in revealing Russian plans and aligning major Western powers behind measures to isolate Russia economically and diplomatically.', '“\ufeffIt’s not a natural thing to share intelligence beyond a handful of our most trusted allies, but we knew that this effort was going to have to be broader and deeper than we had ever done before,” said Jon Finer, the deputy national security adviser.', 'The shift toward disclosures is driven in part by lessons of the past, and startling technological changes that have made more information about wartime activities accessible than ever before, something intelligence officials say allows them to release more information without endangering secret sources.', 'The strategy is also, in part, a product of past intelligence failures. Some failures, most infamously over claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, still color how Europeans view American spy agencies two decades later. Those doubts forced the United States and Britain to share more about what they knew about Russian capabilities and intentions to try to stave off European skepticism.', 'Now, according to some diplomats, when those two allies declassify and release intelligence, it is more readily believed by allies in Europe who were previously uncertain of U.S. and British intelligence on Russia’s war plans.', '“Even though Russia was not deterred by the release of the intelligence information, what was achieved was that everybody was on the same sheet of music when the war started,” said Kaupo Rosin, the director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service, which has also released declassified information.', 'The U.S. release of intelligence has focused on various countries’ support for Russia’s war.  In addition to the warning about China, the White House disclosed plans for Iranian trainers, missiles and drones to join the battlefield in Ukraine. And it shared information about North Korean artillery ammunition going to resupply Russia.', 'The disclosures laid the groundwork for new sanctions by the U.S. and Europe on Iranian drone makers. More information releases are likely, officials said, whenever Russia is close to striking a deal for new weaponry. In addition to calling out countries who are considering supporting Russia, the United States plans to release information on Moscow’s battle plans and preparations, much as officials did in the months before the invasion.', 'The aim would be to call out Russia’s efforts to step up or expand its offensive in the east or south of Ukraine, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Such a disclosure, which would take away the element of surprise, could help Ukraine prepare and galvanize a European response — either through additional economic steps or increased military assistance to Ukraine.', 'Still, there are more limits now than a year ago. Ahead of the invasion, the United States was trying to prod Ukraine to take the threat of invasion more seriously. Now Ukraine is fighting with all its might, and U.S. officials say they want to make sure any disclosure of Russian movements or operational plans aids Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself, not complicate them.', 'Part of the reason the U.S. government can disclose Moscow’s war plans is because Washington-based think tanks, like the Institute for the Study of War or the Russia Studies program at CNA, are scrutinizing various threads of information to examine Russia’s movements. ', 'The surge of such open-source information, which includes images from commercial satellites as well as reports from Russian bloggers, social media posts analyzing weapons found in Ukraine and other information, has enabled the intelligence community to make more disclosures, officials said.', 'Many declassifications have come when the intelligence community can find open-source information that allows analysts to draw similar conclusions.\xa0U.S. officials say they are not aware of any sensitive sources of information that have been lost as a result of the releases — at least so far.', 'In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea, the Obama administration took a more cautious approach when it came to sharing intelligence — then about Russian activities in the Donbas region of Ukraine — with skeptical European allies, a decision that some officials came to see as a mistake because it made it easier for Moscow to sow divisions in the West.', '“Obviously, Biden administration officials have learned from that firsthand experience that most of them had as part of the Obama administration,” said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Ukraine during the Obama years. “You can’t convince people to go along with your policies if they are suspicious about what those policies are based on.”', 'In the fall of 2021, many of the officials who were involved in Obama administration decisions on intelligence sharing were back in power, and they faced a similar dilemma.', 'At first, they were somewhat unconvinced of the dire predictions of U.S. intelligence agencies about a possible Russian invasion.', 'But as they were presented with more evidence, Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden’s national security adviser when he was vice president, and Mr. Finer, his deputy, came to the conclusion that the Biden administration should not allow a repeat of 2014, and needed to find a way to prevent Russia from dividing the West and catching the world by surprise.', 'Mr. Biden agreed and directed that U.S. intelligence about Russia’s war plans be declassified so it could be shared with a broad group of allies.', '“He turned to us in the intelligence community and said, ‘You’ve got to share,’” Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, recalled in a speech last week. “‘You have to get out there and start sharing because we’ve got to help them see what you’re seeing.’”', 'In contrast to 2014, when U.S. officials were largely caught off guard by Russia’s lightning seizure of Crimea, intelligence agencies saw the 2022 invasion coming. As a result, Biden administration officials knew they had weeks, if not months, to lay the groundwork with reluctant allies and to pre-empt Moscow by exposing its plans.', '“There were really strong arguments for going one step further and actually downgrading and declassifying some information so that we can also start to prepare the public landscape,” Mr. Finer said.', 'U.S. intelligence agencies are generally reluctant to share their secrets, but they agreed to do so after taking steps to ensure that the disclosures would not expose their most valuable sources.', 'The new playbook appears to be here to stay: Biden administration officials say they will continue to disclose sensitive information when it is in America’s strategic interest. But that does not mean the administration and intelligence officials will always agree on what to release.', 'In a talk at the Munich Security Conference, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said the decisions to release intelligence had an important impact on the course of the war. But he said intelligence should be released only after an evaluation of the potential benefits and risks of each disclosure.', '“As I’ve learned over many years, the surest way to lose sources of good intelligence is to be reckless in your handling of them,” Mr. Burns said. “There’s always a temptation to think that anything worth doing is worth overdoing. So in this case, I think we have to be careful and case-by-case.”']"

But his vitriolic remarks suggested more discord in Russia’s war effort.,"['On Tuesday, Yevgeny Prigozhin went further than he ever had in his public standoff with Russia’s military leaders, claiming the defense minister and the country’s most senior general were starving his private army of ammunition.', 'He then accused them of treason for weakening his fighters at a crucial moment in the war in Ukraine.', 'By Thursday, the acrimonious and very public dispute appeared to have subsided, with Mr. Prigozhin saying his mercenary group, Wagner, now had the ammunition they desperately needed. In the opaque world of the Russian military, it is impossible to know if his troops got the ammunition, or if the Kremlin lost patience and told him to play nice.', 'Either way, the discord between Mr. Prigozhin and the Russian Defense Ministry undermined the theme of unity emphasized by President Vladimir V. Putin in highly publicized speeches this week, as he rallied the nation for a long war. It also raised new questions about Russia’s ability to sustain a drawn-out war against an increasingly well-armed Ukraine.', 'Tensions between Mr. Prigozhin and Russia’s military command have been building for months, getting ever more bitter as Wagner became the central fighting force for the city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east.', 'Those tensions escalated to a new level on Tuesday, when Mr. Prigozhin, in a series of caustic audio messages, claimed the military command was deliberately withholding supplies to undermine Wagner.', 'The Defense Ministry picked up the gauntlet. In a rare public response that evening, the ministry denied the accusations, and indirectly accused Mr. Prigozhin of aiding the enemy by damaging the unity of Russian forces.', 'Mr. Prigozhin then escalated the dispute further, calling the ministry’s response “an attempt to hide their crimes.” On Wednesday, he published a graphic video showing rows of dozens of corpses, which he said were Wagner fighters who died because of ammunition shortages. The video could not be independently verified.', 'On Thursday, Mr. Prigozhin lowered the tone as suddenly as he raised it, claiming on Telegram that the problem has been solved.', '“We were told that the loading of ammunition has begun,” he said, referring to the warehouses. “From the guys, thank you.”', 'Mr. Prigozhin’s flurry of polemical, often shocking social media activity comes as Wagner and regular military units are storming Bakhmut from three sides and trying to end one of the war’s bloodiest and longest battles.', 'Ukraine this month barred civilians from entering the city, in what some military analysts interpreted as a prelude to withdrawal. The Ukrainian defenders, however, have maintained stiff resistance, forcing Wagner to rely on costly frontal assaults to inch its way toward the city center.', 'These assaults continued this week even as Mr. Prigozhin denounced ammunition shortages, according to Russian military bloggers, making it difficult to estimate the effect of whatever supply problems there were.', '“Ammo hunger is clearly impacting the fighting, both for Wagnerites and ordinary servicemen,” said Ruslan Leviev, a Russian military analyst for the Conflict Intelligence Team, a group of analysts. “It is difficult to tell how serious that hunger is right now.”', 'After operating for years in secrecy, Mr. Prigozhin stepped on the public scene last summer as the Russian invasion of Ukraine sputtered. He skillfully used social media, an ecosystem of troll farms and online propaganda outlets to paint a picture of himself as a straight-talking patriot who was prepared to achieve Russia’s military objectives at any cost.', 'In the process, he presented himself as an antidote to Russia’s staff generals and military bureaucrats, who had failed to capture Ukraine’s capital. He portrayed Wagner as an effective, tight-knit force, and his allies contrasted the group’s advance on Bakhmut with the failures of the Russian Army elsewhere.', 'The group gained strength as Mr. Prigozhin began recruiting from Russian prisons, a move that could have been made possible through the personal involvement of Mr. Putin, his longtime ally.', 'American officials estimated in December that Wagner had about 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 10,000 experienced volunteers and 40,000 convicts. Ukrainian officials, Russian rights activists and Wagner defectors said many former prisoners have since died in near-suicidal attacks meant to wear down Ukrainian defenses.', 'For months, Wagner-affiliated social media accounts have accused Russia’s senior military command of sapping their forces’ strength through costly operational and planning mistakes. Mr. Prigozhin had supported those accusations in oblique comments, but in January his tone became increasingly direct and confrontational.', 'He accused the Defense Ministry of ignoring Wagner’s contribution to the capture of Soledar, a town north of Bakhmut. Soon after, he said the military establishment had prevented him from recruiting convicts, in an effort to destroy Wagner’s “offensive potential.”', 'Prison activists say the Defense Ministry has started directly enlisting in prisons, although there has been no official confirmation of such recruiting.', 'Some analysts said Mr. Prigozhin has turned Russia’s unpopular commanders into targets to boost his public profile, a sign of his growing political ambitions — and that he has suffered a backlash as other commanders try to lessen his power. Others have attributed the tensions to the usual rivalries for Mr. Putin’s favor among officials and businessmen.', '“There’s clearly jealousy at play,” said Dmitri Kuznets, a military analyst for the independent Russian news outlet Meduza.', 'While the dispute appears to have subsided, it put the spotlight on Russian ammunition stocks amid signs that the Kremlin is making moves for the biggest offensive since the initial invasion wave.', 'Mr. Prigozhin’s pleas suggest that Russia is struggling to produce enough shells to sustain military operations that have dragged on for longer than the government expected, said one Russian researcher close to the Defense Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics. For the foreseeable future, the country’s only solution is to import them from nearby nations, he said.', 'His assessment broadly echoed analyses by Western military experts.', 'Some pro-war Russian commentators said Mr. Prigozhin’s complaints show that Wagner and other Russian private military companies, or P.M.C.s, now have to ration scarce supplies like regular army units.', '“The problem is not that P.M.C.s have stopped receiving ammunition, but that they have started receiving them like everyone else,” Aleksandr Khodakovsky, a pro-Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.']"

It means more jobs at the Terem ammunition plant on the outskirts of town.', 'The factory stopped making the 122-millimeter shells in 1988 as the Cold War came to a close. But soon the assembly lines will be running again.\xa0Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned Soviet-era arms and ammunition into critically important matériel as Western nations seek to supply Ukraine with the munitions it needs to foil Moscow’s assault.\xa0', 'And so in January, 35 years after the last 122-millimeter shells left the Terem plant, the company recommissioned production.', 'Small towns in\xa0Bulgaria,\xa0with its large pro-Russian population,\xa0might seem unlikely linchpins of Ukraine’s military effort. But one year into the war, despite an influx of sophisticated Western arms, the Ukrainian military still relies primarily on weapons that fire Soviet-standard munitions. The United States and its NATO allies don’t produce those munitions, and the few countries outside Russia that do are mostly in the former Soviet orbit.', 'That has Western countries scrambling to find alternative sources, pouring millions of dollars into workarounds that keep the transactions quiet and avoid political fallout and Russian retaliation. And that brings them to some of the more remote areas of Eastern Europe, like Kostenets, and the\xa0small\xa0town of Sopot,\xa0roughly 50 miles to the northeast, which is home to another state-run arms factory.', 'Representatives from the U.S. embassy quietly attended the ribbon-cutting last month for the new production line in Kostenets, which took place outside the plant,\xa0a rundown low-slung building\xa0in a corner of the town. With the new jobs it’s adding, the plant could become one of Kostenets’s biggest employers.', '“This is a big deal for the town,” said Deputy Mayor Margarita Mincheva.', 'Sopot, too, has seen its fortunes improve since the invasion. It is home to VMZ, an arms company that employs much of the local work force. On a recent Friday the dull thud of explosions rattled windows — they were likely tests of freshly made munitions, the town’s mayor said.', 'Over the years VMZ has been a main source of income for Sopot’s residents, the mayor, Deyan Doinov, added. “Probably there isn’t a single family in town whose members haven’t worked or are not working at the plant,” he said. “Virtually we have no unemployment — only those who do not want to work are jobless.”', 'Bulgaria has historically close ties to Moscow, though it has been part of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since the early 2000s. Last summer, revelations that Bulgaria supplied weapons to Ukraine, despite a strong opposition toward arming Kyiv, ignited a furor in the country’s politics.', 'Bulgaria’s projected arms exports last year soared, exceeding $3 billion, around five times the sales abroad in 2019, according to government estimates from data gathered in October.', 'But it is hardly the only country quietly contributing to Ukraine’s war effort. Luxembourg is supplying Ukraine with arms that originate in the Czech Republic. Brokers with cash from the United States are scouring factories in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Romania for shells. And Britain has formed a secret task force to arm Ukraine, according to a document The New York Times obtained and officials familiar with the task force’s work.', 'The importance of such sources is growing as Ukraine burns through ammunition at an unsustainable rate — one that Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said last week was “many times higher than our current rate of production.”', '“This puts our defense industries under strain,” he added.', 'In recent months, Ukraine\xa0has fired between 2,000 and 4,000 artillery shells daily, but would like to fire more so it can retake territory captured by Russia. At one point last summer Russia was firing as many as 50,000 shells a day. But that number has dropped since then, and Russia, too, is suffering from an ammunition shortage.', 'The United States is boosting its own production of artillery shells sixfold to fill the gaps. But it mostly makes ammunition for the NATO-standard howitzers it has sent to Ukraine.', 'Once the invasion began last year, Ukraine and its allies\xa0started buying up Soviet-style arms wherever they could find them. State-owned Ukrainian companies asked brokers in America and elsewhere for tanks, helicopters, planes and mortars, according to documents obtained by The Times.', 'Would-be suppliers emerged from the recesses of the global weapons trade to meet demand. Last June, a Czech arms seller offered Ukraine ammunition and a dozen Soviet-model ground-attack jets built between 1984 and 1990 for about $185 million, the documents show.', 'Both Britain and the United States have financed deals using third-party countries and brokers in cases where manufacturing countries don’t want to be publicly identified as providing weapons to Ukraine, people familiar with the effort say.', 'The secret task force created by the British defense ministry focused on getting Soviet-style ammunition, say people familiar with the effort, a task that became harder as the war went on and big suppliers ran out of stock.', 'Last June, Britain made a deal with Pakistan to buy 40,000 artillery shells and rockets made by the government-owned Pakistan Ordnance Factories. Under the terms of the deal, Britain would pay a Romanian broker to buy the Pakistani weapons, documents show. The transaction’s official paperwork said the weapons would be transferred from Pakistan to Britain, with no mention of Ukraine, a document obtained by The Times shows.', 'The deal fell apart after the Pakistani supplier was unable to deliver the ammunition, said Marius Rosu, the export chief of the Romanian broker, Romtehnica.', 'Such problems are common in deals relying on brokers and far-flung manufacturers.

It provided arms to both sides of the Iran-Iraq war and to Libya, among other customers, and after the Soviet Union fell it supplied rebels in Angola and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.', 'Even after Bulgaria joined the European Union and NATO, its arms industry continued pumping out Soviet-caliber ammunition. That created opportunity after the United States sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. American allies in those countries used Soviet-era weapons, and the United States bought ammunition from Bulgaria to supply them.', 'After Syria’s civil war began in 2011, Bulgarian munitions appeared there — likely part of the\xa0campaign to arm groups fighting the Syrian regime.', 'That put Bulgaria at odds with Russia, which supported the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Russian assassins poisoned a Bulgarian arms dealer in 2015, and since then a series of unexplained explosions have rocked Bulgarian arms companies.', 'Lyuba, the saleswoman, said the presence of the Terem arms factory, which was shaken by an accidental explosion in 2014, makes Kostenets a Russian target.', '“We are ordinary people; we will probably never know what exactly they are making there,” she said.', 'A fortuitously timed election helped ease the way for Bulgaria to become a major supplier to Ukraine.\xa0In the fall of 2021, during Russia’s buildup to the invasion, a new party took power, and Kiril Petkov, the\xa0Harvard-educated prime minister, decided it was a moment that Bulgaria could turn away from Russia and toward the West.', '“We wanted to be on the right side of history,” he said in an interview this month.', 'Mr. Petkov’s governing coalition included an historically Russia-friendly party that balked at sending arms to Ukraine, so they came up with a workaround that would let Bulgaria deny, officially, that it was arming Ukraine: The government would approve exports to other European Union countries, including Poland. Once there, the weapons could travel to Ukraine without Bulgaria being involved.', 'Sales picked up and factories boosted their output. Bulgarian ammunition soon accounted for one-third of Ukraine’s supplies, Mr. Petkov said.', 'Mr. Petkov’s government fell a few months later, when another party left his coalition.

The mood was buoyant. Business was booming, the factory was running 24/7, and sales were projected to grow by double digits. “We had a beautiful budget,” Rostyslav Vovk, the company’s chief executive and founder, recalled almost dreamily.', 'The next morning, air sirens sounded.', 'Russia had invaded. Mr. Vovk called his top managers to meet at a nearby hotel, avoiding the company’s windowed seventh-floor headquarters in Lviv. They had a plan for what had been considered a very unlikely risk — Russian aggression — but it soon proved wholly inadequate.', '“We were not ready,” Mr. Vovk said. He closed the plant. Raw materials couldn’t get into the country, and deliveries headed abroad couldn’t get out. Staff from the besieged eastern part of the country needed to be evacuated.

Before the war, Ukraine’s private sector, including its huge steel and agricultural industries, accounted for 70 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, said Elena Voloshina, head of the International Finance Corporation in Ukraine. Eighty-three percent of businesses experienced losses related to the war, she said. Forty percent suffered direct damage, like a factory or store decimated by a missile, while 25 percent were in what is now occupied territory.', 'Last year, Ukraine’s overall output plunged by nearly a third, wrecking the country’s economy and hampering its ability to battle Russian forces.', 'Kormotech, a family-owned business with 1,300 employees worldwide, does not produce weapons or drones. It isn’t involved in supplying critically needed electricity, transport or fresh water to ravaged cities. But it employs people, produces income, earns foreign currency from exports, and contributes tax revenue that the government in Kyiv desperately needs to pay soldiers, repair power lines and buy medical equipment.', 'A year later, Mr. Vovk and his management team have found reason to again celebrate. Mr. Vovk was back in his offices getting ready for the latest annual meeting with his staff — and some of their dogs, which are fixtures around the office and often serve as product taste testers. Despite the odds, business grew more than expected.', 'Kormotech had a few things going for it. The company’s plant was outside Lviv in the westernmost part of the country, near the Polish border, one of the safest parts of Ukraine. The two factories in Prylbychi were able to reopen less than two weeks after the war began.', 'An earlier decision to start an additional factory in Lithuania, which opened in 2020 and was operating around the clock, turned out to be a boon. It could continue smoothly producing and delivering tons of Kormotech’s Club 4 Paws, Optimeal, Miau and Gav brands.', 'After a helter-skelter start, Mr. Vovk and his top managers reorganized. The company, which sells its products in 35 countries including the United States and Europe, had a little wiggle room because they had avoided just-in-time practices that eliminated backup inventory — a cost-cutting approach that had stymied so many companies worldwide during the pandemic. Kormotech routinely kept stock in its warehouses — at least a month and a half’s worth in Ukraine, two months in other countries in Europe and two and a half in the United States.', 'Still, Kormotech’s supply chain was disrupted. Before the war, roughly half its raw materials, like meat and chicken meal, came from abroad. Now border crossing delays and rising import prices had prompted a search for domestic producers. It found two that had never produced pet meal before and taught them what to do.', 'Kateryna Kovaliuk, Kormotech’s chief reputation officer, emphasized that pet food standards could often be more exacting than food produced for people. During a recent tour of the Lviv plant, she picked up a few kibble-size bits chopped up from long ropelike strands of cat food fresh off the production line.', '“Try it,” she urged, before popping a couple of pieces in her mouth and smiling. “It’s good. It tastes like meat without salt.”', 'As it turned out, the local producers, less than 40 miles from the plant, were not only cheaper but also didn’t have to be paid in precious foreign currency. Instead of buying 500 tons of meal from abroad, the company now buys 100 tons.', 'Kormotech stepped up its purchase of Ukrainian grains and corn as well. The war and Russian blockade caused a drastic drop in grain exports, spiraling food prices and a global hunger crisis. But it also meant that domestic businesses like Kormotech could buy at a discount.', 'Manufacturing the product was one hurdle; getting it delivered abroad was another. At a time when Ukraine has barred men under 60 from leaving the country, the trade ministry provided exemptions for delivery drivers.', 'But the wait at the borders could extend from a few days to a few weeks. And with seaports mostly blocked, exporting remained an expensive and tricky problem.', '“No one knew where to go or how,” Mr. Vovk said. The first truck sent to Azerbaijan, he said, cost more than $8,000 — before the war, it was roughly $2,000.', 'Domestic demand for its products stayed steady, but finding new export markets was another challenge. Belarus, which has allowed Russia to stage attacks from inside its border, represented 25 percent of Kormotech’s export market. The management team decided to pull out but needed to replace those customers.', 'Supermarket chains, particularly in the Baltic countries and Poland, were eager to step in and replace Russian-made goods with Ukrainian ones.', '“For the first time in my life, ‘Made in Ukraine’ was a premium,” Mr. Vovk said. Previously, when the company appeared at international pet supply exhibitions, he said with a laugh, people were so unfamiliar with the country’s products, they would ask if the letters “u” and “k” referred to “the U.K.,” for the United Kingdom.', 'Even so, good will extended only so far. Buyers wanted assurances that Kormotech’s products would keep flowing. So the company provided guarantees, setting up a warehouse in Poland with backup stocks of its 650 different products, outsourcing some production to facilities in Germany and Poland, and drawing up last-resort plans to move production out of Ukraine.', 'The enormous growth in both the European and American markets means that the company’s sales are expected to increase to $155 million this year from $124 million. The main obstacle to expanding even more is capacity.', 'Kormotech scrapped plans for a new 92 million-euro factory because of uncertainty and the difficulty in getting financing. But it invested €5 million ($5.34 million) in the Prylbychi plant and €7 million ($7.5 million) in Lithuania.', 'Of course, many businesses have not been as successful as Kormotech, either because their facilities were damaged or demand for their products was eviscerated when people fled the country, as well as by ravenous inflation and shrunken incomes. Mr. Vovk said the exodus of millions of mothers and children had left a friend’s diaper manufacturing business in tatters.', 'A new report from the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine and McKinsey & Company found that only 15 percent of companies grew last year, while nearly half saw a decline in sales.', 'Others have adapted by relocating to places like Lviv, or changing their output to fill new wartime demands, like the lingerie seamstresses who have switched to sewing cloth vests to fit body armor plates. Ukraine’s large and mobile information technology sector has also remained strong.', 'Businesses are still struggling to adapt. Russian attacks on Ukraine’s power grids compelled Kormotech to buy two generators at €150,000 apiece, supersize versions of the small colorful units that noisily hum outside nearly every shop and cafe on Lviv’s streets.', 'Now, the Russians are stepping up missile strikes. On a recent weekday, air raid alerts caused 200 plant workers to spend more than half of their 12-hour shift in a tunnel-like storage area about three paces wide that doubles as a bomb shelter.', 'Vira Protsyk, who normally would be packing boxes, sat on one of the wooden benches that lined the 100-foot-long wall. “It’s a bit boring,” she said of the forced breaks. This was the second alert of the day. “I didn’t want to go to the shelter. I’d rather work.”']"

The reality was even more complicated.","['WARSAW — In a day of dueling efforts to shore up allegiances, President Biden wrapped up a three-day trip to Europe Wednesday with a promise of America’s commitment to its allies as President Vladimir V. Putin warmly welcomed China’s top diplomat to Moscow and rallied pro-war Russians.', 'With the anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine approaching, Mr. Biden met in Warsaw with leaders from NATO’s eastern flank, acknowledging that “you know better than anyone what’s at stake in this conflict, not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world.”', 'At around\xa0the same time, Mr. Putin\xa0told a boisterous crowd of tens of thousands at a stadium rally that “there is a battle underway on our historical borders, for our people,” just after he tried to shore up his most important partnership in a meeting with the top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi.', 'Taken together, the scenes created the impression that the world is retreating into two blocs that bear similarities to those of the Cold War.', 'This time, many former Eastern Bloc countries — Hungary is a notable exception — are aligning with the West to oppose Mr. Putin’s aggression. And China and Russia, dropping their many differences, are conducting military exercises together and deepening their financial ties as each faces Western sanctions.', 'But the reality is still more complicated.', 'Many other powers — including India, Turkey and Israel — remain on the fence, continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia or to work with Mr. Putin diplomatically, while buying arms from the United States and remaining in its defense orbit. That has touched off a messy, behind-the-scenes effort by both sides to win support.', 'For Mr. Biden, the question is whether the Western allies have the wherewithal to continue arming and supporting the Ukrainian government at the levels needed to keep an emerging Russian offensive at bay, and to deter Mr. Putin from once again seeking to take over the entire country.', 'For Mr. Putin, the doubts may be even greater, even as he tries to telegraph confidence and public support.', 'An offensive he began in recent weeks has yet to make substantial gains. And while he welcomed Mr. Wang at the Kremlin and spoke of a coming visit from China’s president, Xi Jinping, it is clear that China is wary about being seen as supporting the war — and at a moment when American officials are releasing intelligence suggesting that Mr. Putin is again seeking arms and technology from Beijing.', '“China is willing to work with Russia to maintain a strategic focus, deepen mutual political trust and enhance strategic coordination,” Mr. Wang told Mr. Putin. He also said the Chinese-Russian partnership “is not aimed at any third party, and will not accept meddling from any third party, and even less will it accept duress from any third party.”', 'That was a clear reference to the United States, which has threatened that any material aid from China to Moscow’s war effort would result in economic reprisals.', 'Keeping China in his corner is a priority for Mr. Putin, with Russia looking to Beijing as a critical trading partner in the face of Western sanctions. In an apparent nod to China’s discomfort with being seen as a military ally, Mr. Putin said in his televised opening remarks to Mr. Wang that “economic issues” were “above all” the field in which the two countries’ relationship was “reaching new frontiers.”', 'Still, Chinese and Russian naval ships are holding drills off the coast of South Africa this week — a reminder that the two countries are also deepening their military cooperation.', 'Mr. Putin, at least economically, is clearly the junior member of the partnership. It is the reverse of Soviet days, when few imagined that China might become the world’s second-largest economy.', 'In the view of American officials, Mr. Xi has his doubts about supporting Russia’s invasion, but is happy to aid Mr. Putin both to distract the United States from its economic competition with Beijing and to tie up the American military resources being used to support Ukraine.', 'Mr. Biden used his session with the allies at Warsaw’s royal castle to repeat his vow to “defend literally every inch of NATO.” So far, the Kremlin has not struck outside Ukraine’s borders, but that restraint has not extended to cyberspace: Google recently reported that cyberstrikes from Russia on computer users in NATO countries in 2022 were up 300 percent over the same period in 2020.', 'Mr. Biden, who championed the post-Cold War order as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president, used the meeting in Warsaw to underscore how much the world has altered in a year.', '“The idea that over 100,000 forces would invade another country — since World War II, nothing like that has happened,’’ Mr. Biden said. “Things have changed radically. And we have to, we have to make sure we change them back.”', 'Mr. Putin offered a starkly different message, saying that he was restoring Russia to its rightful place, and reassembling territories he contends are part of the Russian empire. Yet Mr. Putin’s public events Wednesday spoke to some of the risks of his stuttering war, whose precise aims he did little to clarify in his 100-minute state-of-the-nation address the day before.', 'Mr. Wang arrived in Moscow after visiting Western European countries, where he sought to persuade their leaders that Beijing wants to encourage an end to the war in Ukraine. But Mr. Wang’s published remarks to Mr. Putin and other Russian officials indicated that Beijing will not risk its friendship with Moscow over Ukraine.', '“Both sides engaged in a thorough exchange of views about the Ukraine issue,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Mr. Wang, it said, “approved of Russia’s reaffirmation that it is willing to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiations.”', 'After the meeting, Mr. Putin tended to the home front. He walked onto a stage at the Moscow stadium that hosted the 2018 World Cup men’s soccer final and told the Russians in the stands — many of them bused-in students and government workers — that their soldiers were fighting “on our historical borders, for our people.”', '“Russia!” Mr. Putin blared into his microphone, leading the crowd in a chant.', 'The official occasion was a Kremlin-organized celebration of a military holiday, Defenders of the Fatherland Day. But it appeared a clear effort by Mr. Putin to show his country and the world a stamp of public approval a day after his state-of-the-nation speech, in which he painted a picture of war as the country’s new normal.', '“All our people are defenders of the fatherland,” Mr. Putin said at the rally. “When we are united, we have no equal.”', 'At Mr. Biden’s meeting with NATO leaders, the message was plain enough: If Mr. Putin were to order tanks into other European countries, the nine nations along the military alliance’s eastern flank would be the likeliest targets.', 'With Mr. Biden listening, President Klaus Iohannis of Romania urged the group to stand firmly behind Ukraine, in part as a way of securing peace for the people living in the shadow of Russia.', '“The war has brought nothing but suffering and despair, killing and displacing of millions of Ukrainians, unprecedented destruction and uncertainty,” Mr. Iohannis said. “We the leaders of the eastern flank have the duty to stand firm in defense of our peace.”', 'In a speech from the royal castle in Warsaw on Tuesday, Mr. Biden was resolute about American commitment to the defense of NATO allies, declaring that the guarantee to come to the aid of any threatened ally “is rock solid.”', '“And every member of NATO knows it,” he said. “And Russia knows it as well.”', 'But the threat of direct military intervention is less theoretical for Poland, Hungary and the other countries whose borders lie not far from Russian territory than for Britain, France or Spain.', 'After the meeting, Mr. Biden departed Poland for Washington, concluding a foreign trip that began with a top-secret visit to Ukraine’s capital and ended with declarations of unity but a looming sense of uncertainty about the future.']"

Several attendees from the Moscow region said they had been encouraged by their employers to go.', '“People were bused there, forced to attend; we have reports of that from multiple universities” said Professor Yudin.', '“Putin coerces people, lures them into participating, and these students are promised free passes on exams,” he continued. “He wants both the total mobilization of the country and the total passivity, a total acceptance,” an approach he described as “schizophrenic.”', 'The 81,000-seat stadium appeared more than full despite temperatures far below freezing, with people in the aisles and on the field, and thousands more on the grounds outside. And for many of them — at least those willing to speak with an American journalist — the enthusiasm seemed genuine, even if they have been touched by the war’s losses.', '“I support it, yes, because it was high time to start this,” Katya, 26, who works for an aesthetic medicine clinic in the Moscow region, said of the war. She cited what she called the suffering of many friends from the Donetsk region of Ukraine, where Moscow’s separatist proxies began fighting Kyiv eight years before\xa0Russia’s full-scale invasion last year.', 'But Katya admitted that she wished the war had ended already, and said one of her university classmates had been killed.

He accused the Russian leader of wide-ranging atrocities and called on the world to stand up to him and other “tyrants.”', '“Autocrats only understand one word: No, no, no,” Mr. Biden declared, standing under a cold drizzle in front of an enthusiastic crowd of thousands waving American and Ukrainian flags at the royal castle in Warsaw. “President Putin chose this war,” he added. “Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word.”', 'Mr. Putin expected Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, to fall to the Russian invasion, but “Kyiv stands!” Mr. Biden thundered, appearing energized by his surprise trip to that city the day before. But he added that the fight continued, and that there would be “hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies.”', 'In Moscow, giving an annual state-of-the-nation speech earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Putin blamed the United States and its allies for turning the Ukraine conflict into a “global confrontation.” He evoked the high-stakes drama of the Cold War by announcing a suspension of Russia’s participation in the last remaining nuclear treaty with America, whose verification requirements his country had already been ignoring.', 'The Russian leader — much like his American counterpart in the dueling address — indicated a grim immediate future ahead in Ukraine, one where the grinding war is likely to continue for years, testing the patience of Russia’s people, business leaders and already bloodied military.', 'Mr. Putin spent much of the 100-minute speech on the nuts and bolts of preparing Russia for a long-term confrontation. He urged oligarchs to bring their money home, because, he said, Western countries could not be trusted. He promised changes to Russia’s education system, and to science and technology policy — dragging them back from Western-style approaches — to help the country outlast sanctions.', 'And though he did not acknowledge the heavy losses Russian forces have suffered, he pledged that soldiers and draftees taking part in the war would receive two weeks of leave every six months.', 'Mr. Putin underpinned all of that with his usual appeal to cultural issues, even citing the Church of England’s consideration of gender-neutral terms to refer to God.', '“Millions of people in the West understand that they are being led to a real spiritual catastrophe,” Mr. Putin said, though he did not mention Mr. Biden by name. “The elites, one must say, are simply going crazy.”', 'Mr. Biden’s aides said the president’s intention was to mark Friday’s anniversary of the Russian invasion by celebrating allied solidarity and delivering the message that freedom and democracy were at stake on the battlefields of Ukraine.', 'But the split-screen moment was undeniable, as the two leaders spoke about 700 miles and a few hours apart. Mr. Biden did not call Mr. Putin a war criminal, as he did from Warsaw in March of last year, but he leveled a string of accusations against Mr. Putin, including taking Ukrainian children in an attempt to steal the country’s future, and for months cutting off exports of Ukrainian grain, causing a global food shortage.', '“Putin tried to starve the world,” he said.', 'The speeches came at a critical moment. While the European allies have held together far more effectively than anyone expected a year ago, there were signs at the Munich Security Conference, which concluded on Sunday, that many European leaders are wondering whether they will be able to sustain the current level of spending on arms, government support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.', 'Mr. Biden praised the spirit of the people of Moldova, a former Soviet republic, for having the resolve to “live in freedom,” and he recalled how Poles endured for decades “under the iron fist of Communist rule.” He suggested that Moldova, Poland and pro-democracy dissidents in Belarus, Russia’s authoritarian ally, represent the thirst for freedom in the face of oppressive regimes.', 'Mr. Biden acknowledged that there were real questions when the war started about whether the democratic nations of Europe and the world would rise to the challenge. Those questions, he said, have now been answered.', '“Yes, we would stand up for sovereignty — and we did,” Mr. Biden told the crowd, which stood bathed in lights aimed at the centuries-old castle. “Yes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression — and we did. We would stand up for democracy — and we did.”', 'The president’s speech followed meetings with President Andrzej Duda of Poland. Mr. Biden called the relationship between their countries a crucial part of the success of NATO, which he called “maybe the most consequential alliance in history.”', 'Mr. Biden was scheduled to meet on Wednesday with the “Bucharest Nine,” the leaders of countries along the eastern flank of NATO, most of them sharing borders with Russia, Ukraine or Belarus.', 'In the most impassioned moment of the speech, Mr. Biden vowed to uphold NATO’s Article 5 defense pact. “An attack against one is an attack against all,” he declared. “It’s a sacred oath. A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory.”', 'In Moscow, Russian officials were busy shoring up their most important international relationship as Wang Yi, China’s most senior foreign policy official, visited the Russian capital. Video released by the Kremlin showed Mr. Wang exchanging a friendly handshake with Nikolai P. Patrushev, Mr. Putin’s top national security aide.', 'Mr. Wang met with Western officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, at the Munich conference last weekend, and promised that China would try to use diplomacy to end the war in Ukraine. But the televised portion of Mr. Wang’s meeting with Mr. Patrushev focused on Russia and China’s bilateral ties.', 'Mr. Patrushev told Mr. Wang that both nations were under pressure from “the collective West,” so that their deepening cooperation “is taking on special significance.” Mr. Wang said that Russia and China should “develop new steps of strategic cooperation in accordance with the changing situation.”', 'Mr. Wang will hold more meetings in Moscow on Wednesday, and the Kremlin has hinted at a meeting with Mr. Putin.', 'In Mr. Putin’s speech on Tuesday, the only major revelation was that he would not allow U.S. inspections to verify compliance with New START, a nuclear arms control treaty that is set to expire in three years. He did not signal any major change in how he would wage the war in Ukraine: There was no official declaration of war, no announcement of a new draft, and no new threat of using nuclear weapons.', 'Instead, Mr. Putin’s main underlying message was that Russians, and implicitly the Western coalition that opposes him, must prepare for the war — which he continued to call a “special military operation” — to last for years.', '“We will solve the tasks before us step by step, carefully and consistently,” he said. Claiming that the West was trying to “shift a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation,” he pledged that “we will respond accordingly.” The more long-range weapons the West delivers to Ukraine, he said, “the farther we will be forced to move the threat from our borders.”', 'The confident picture presented by Mr. Putin drew plenty of applause from the ruling elites — regional officials, lawmakers, Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church — gathered in a hall across Red Square from the Kremlin. It ignored Russia’s repeated setbacks at the front and its bloody, slow-moving efforts to eke out territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.', 'His words signaled that Russia was prepared to intensify the fighting, but they sounded less ominous than the barely veiled threats he made several times last year about the potential use of nuclear weapons. Mr. Putin’s tone was more measured than that in his last major speech to the nation, in September, when he announced a military draft and said he was ready to use “all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people.”', '“Everything is changing now, changing very fast,” Mr. Putin said on Tuesday, referring to the consequences of war and of sanctions. “This is a time of not just challenges, but of opportunities.”', 'Mr. Putin suggested that time was on his side, because Ukraine’s people could still turn against their government and the West could face its own political upheavals. After listing examples of what he described as the West’s moral depravity, Mr. Putin said that many people around the world agreed with him.', 'There was no new policy evident in Mr. Biden’s speech, either, though the president promised new sanctions on Russia by the end of the week and said vaguely that “we will hold accountable those who are responsible” for the war.', 'He did not address the limitations of sanctions, which the West has discovered as China, India and Turkey, among others, have kept buying Russian petroleum products.', 'Mr. Biden thanked Poland for taking in 1.5 million Ukrainian war refugees and for becoming the primary transfer point for a flood of arms that have been critical for Ukraine’s military forces. But his rallying cry to the Polish people omitted discussion of the White House’s current worries.', 'Mr. Biden and his aides are concerned that the war could be devolving into a stalemate, in which neither side will negotiate but neither can turn the tide.', 'He made no reference to Mr. Putin’s announcement about New START. Nor did he mention Mr. Putin’s episodic threats to employ nuclear weapons, usually uttered when Russian forces were losing ground.', 'But while the White House has tried at various points to make the case that the war in Ukraine is a battle for the preservation of some norms of national behavior — respect for the sovereignty of nations, and the right of populations to choose their leaders — he kept returning to Mr. Putin himself.', 'At one point he mocked one of the Russian leader’s core claims, that Russia invaded in self-defense. Mr. Putin said earlier in the day that NATO had been planning to attack Russia, presumably from inside Ukraine.', '“The West was not plotting to attack Russia,” Mr. Biden said.', 'The war, he argued, was brought about solely by the Russian leader’s desires, but “President Putin’s craven lust for land and power will fail.”']"

Putin of Russia, blamed Mr. Zelensky for the invasion of Ukraine, saying he should have stopped attacking the contested Donbas region, playing into Mr. Putin’s false pretext of invading Ukraine to stop a genocide against ethnic Russians.', 'Another of Ms. Meloni’s allies, Matteo Salvini, built part of his populist career out of opposing sanctions on Russia and once said he preferred Mr. Putin to his own president.', 'Mr. Zelensky, addressing Mr. Berlusconi’s criticism at the news conference on Tuesday, said the former prime minister never had to deal with tanks arriving in his backyard or Russian airstrikes bombarding his home.', '“I think Mr. Berlusconi has not had to get up at three in the morning because of blackouts to start washing clothes, making food for his children two days in advance because there may not be power for the next two, three days, because of the great love of the brotherly Russian people,” he said, according to Reuters.', 'Condemning the Russian invasion, Ms. Meloni said on Tuesday that “the fate of the European Union and Western democracies also depends on Ukraine’s victory in the face of those who want to trample international law by force.”', 'The only peace possible would be one agreed to by Ukraine, she said, and could not involve Ukrainian surrender — just as “a victory of Russia would not be peace” but “a prelude to the possible invasion of other European states.”', '“Ukraine’s interests coincide with those of Europe,” she said.', 'Ms. Meloni arrived in Kyiv by train earlier on Tuesday, traveling from Poland, where she had met with Polish officials and reiterated Italy’s unwavering support for Ukraine.', 'It was the first time in Kyiv for Ms. Meloni, a hard-right leader who so far has governed in a far less vitriolic and ideological — and more practical — way than her detractors had predicted after she took office in October.', 'Ms. Meloni also said that Italy was planning to host an international conference in April on the reconstruction of Ukraine.', '“Rebuilding a destroyed building is a sign of hope,” she said. “And because speaking of Ukraine’s reconstruction means betting on the victory of Ukraine. ”', 'Before meeting with Mr. Zelensky, Ms. Meloni visited Bucha — a suburb of Kyiv where retreating Russian soldiers massacred civilians in the early weeks of the war — and Irpin, one of the first Ukrainian cities to be destroyed and liberated. In Irpin, she distributed aid to civilians and signed a Ukrainian flag with the words, “At your side.”']"

He announced that he would suspend Russia’s participation in the New START treaty, the last surviving arms control agreement between Washington and Moscow.', 'Blame: In his address, Putin claimed that Western nations had “started the war” in Ukraine — an assertion that Biden flatly rejected in Warsaw. “President Putin chose this war. Every day the war continues is his choice,” Biden said. He accused the Russian leader of committing atrocities on a vast scale.', 'A long war: Putin showed no sign that he would change course. He sidestepped Russia’s battlefield struggles and used his speech to lay out a plan for a long war to come. He promised changes to the education system, and to science and technology policy, to help Russia outlast Western sanctions.

Seven years later, Almadi was arrested during a visit to Saudi Arabia and sentenced to 16 years in prison. After he appealed, his sentence was lengthened to 19 years.', 'Ten\xa0years ago, Almadi’s account may have prompted a warning or an interrogation. Saudi prosecutors now argue that posts that are critical of the government, including Almadi’s, support terrorism or other views that threaten its security.', 'Context: Until recently, prison sentences longer than 20 years were rare in the kingdom, and Saudis with American citizenship or ties to local elites, like Almadi, would have been able to draw on connections to protect themselves. “One of the merits of Mohammed bin Salman is that he’s created equality of injustice for all,” said a Saudi lawyer who lives in exile in Germany.', 'In his nearly eight months in office, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has adopted the Philippines’ most muscular foreign policy in close to a decade.

He said it also showed how the war was reshaping Russian politics.', '“Prigozhin is positioning himself as a de facto leader of a faction opposed to the military establishment in Russia’s main political arena, which today is the war,” said Mr. Kuznets.', 'A native of St. Petersburg, Mr. Prigozhin operated for years in secrecy, using connections forged with Vladimir V. Putin when Mr. Putin worked in that city, to win catering and construction contracts with the government. After making his fortune, he began building up Wagner, using his mercenary force both to expand his businesses and to advance the Kremlin’s political goals in eastern Ukraine, Syria and Africa.', 'The invasion of Ukraine supercharged his public profile, turning him from a shadow operator into one of the most visible faces of the Kremlin’s military effort. And as the Russian armed forces suffered one humiliating setback after another, Mr. Prigozhin presented Wagner as a bulwark of Russian interests.', 'In his social media appearances, Mr. Prigozhin offered a stark contrast to the straight-faced Kremlin apparatchiks, appearing in battlefield catacombs, the cockpit of an airborne military jet and Siberian penal colonies.', 'Swelled with recruits from Russian prisons, Wagner emerged as a capable fighting formation, leading the monthslong assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which has become the focal battle of the war. Wagner has gradually tightened its grip on the city in recent weeks by overrunning surrounding villages in a series of costly frontal assaults.', 'Wagner’s gains around Bakhmut have made it the only Russian force to make meaningful progress since offensive operations were revved up this month. That probably stoked jealousy from the military command, Mr. Kuznets said.', 'But Mr. Prigozhin’s growing self-promotion and disdain for bureaucracy have begun to cause concern among some Kremlin insiders. Some see in his social media performances a hint of political ambition.', 'Now, Mr. Prigozhin’s long-running criticism of the military hierarchy, once oblique, has taken on an aggressive, even desperate tone, just as the battle for Bakhmut appears to be entering a critical phase. Explaining his decision to go public with his accusations against the military commanders, Mr. Prigozhin in one audio message said, “I don’t have an option, I’m going until the end.”', '“My people are dying in heaps,” he said.', 'Mr. Prigozhin accused the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery V. Gerasimov, of deliberately starving Wagner of supplies, using their titles but not directly naming the two men.', 'The accusations came days after Mr. Prigozhin said the defense ministry had banned him from recruiting new fighters from Russian jails to “bleed out” Wagner and deny it victory in Bakhmut.', 'Since last summer, Wagner has recruited tens of thousands of convicts by securing a presidential pardon for the enlisted men, a campaign that appeared to show the extent of Mr. Prigozhin’s influence with Mr. Putin.', 'But this week’s audio messages suggest that his access to the Russian leader may be waning, some analysts said.', '“This is an act of desperation,” one political scientist, Tatiana Stanovaya, wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Monday. “It’s an attempt to reach Putin through publicity, to scare the military command with political consequences.”', 'Mr. Prigozhin said Monday that he had not had problems with ammunition under the last commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, referring to him by name. General Surovikin was replaced by General Gerasimov last month.', 'Some analysts have interpreted the appointment of General Gerasimov, who holds a position equivalent to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States, as an attempt to improve coordination between Russia’s fighting forces ahead of a spring offensive.', 'Even as Mr. Prigozhin escalated his attacks on the military command, he appeared to be trying to shore up alliances with other paramilitary leaders who could be affected by the shake-up of the Russian military. In recent days, he has posted photos and videos with Apti Alaudinov, commander of pro-Kremlin Chechen fighters in Ukraine, and Eduard Basurin, a former commander of a pro-Russian militia in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.', 'Mr. Alaudinov’s boss, the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, has also criticized the wartime performance of Russian generals. And prominent Russian military bloggers said last week that Mr. Basurin had fallen victim to Moscow’s recent purge of Donbas separatist officers.', 'Mr. Prigozhin’s caustic audio messages were especially remarkable given that they were released just before Mr. Putin made his state of the nation address in Moscow, in which he called for unity in a war that he falsely said had been caused by Western aggression.', 'Mr. Prigozhin did not appear to be among the dozens of military leaders and decorated soldiers present for the address, and Mr. Putin did not mention Wagner during his lengthy praise of the Russian military in Ukraine. Mr. Putin said he had chosen to omit the names of various “volunteer” units from his speech.', '“I was afraid of upsetting those whom I would not mention,” he said.', 'When asked by a journalist to comment on the speech, Mr. Prigozhin said he had been too busy to watch it, a response that played into his image as a maverick.', 'Ms. Stanovaya said the public tensions between Wagner and the defense ministry were unlikely to be well received by the Russian president, who has made obedience and coordination between subordinates a cornerstone of his rule.', '“I can say with almost 100 percent certainty that all of these clashes, this infighting, are infuriating” Mr. Putin, she wrote.', 'But Mr. Prigozhin appeared to be far from backing down. He called the defense ministry’s response to his complaints “a spit in the direction of PMC Wagner and an attempt to hide their crimes against those fighters.”']"

Sanger'],https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/world/europe/putin-new-start-treaty.html,Putin’s Move on Nuclear Treaty May Signal End to Formal Arms Control,,"['WARSAW — When President Vladimir V. Putin announced at the end of a 100-minute speech on Tuesday that he would suspend Russia’s participation in the New START treaty — the last surviving arms control agreement between the two largest nuclear-armed powers — it was the latest sign that the decades-long era of formal arms control may be dying.', 'Mr. Putin made clear that he was not pulling out of the treaty, which expires in February 2026. And hours after the speech, Russia’s Foreign Ministry declared the country had no intention to deploy more strategic nuclear arms — the kind that can soar across continents — beyond the limits of the treaty, which keeps both sides to 1,550 nuclear weapons. That set aside, at least for the next few years, the prospect of a resumed arms race between the two largest nuclear powers.', 'But the chances are rapidly diminishing that Russia and the United States, in the midst of the bitter war in Ukraine and mutual recriminations on a scale not seen in decades, can find their way to sit down to negotiate a replacement treaty, much less agree to one. And Mr. Putin’s declaration that he will block American inspectors from verifying treaty compliance made clear, once again, that he views his nuclear arsenal as a key element of power as he tries to revive his stumbling effort to take over a nation whose right to exist as an independent state he refuses to acknowledge.', 'He is also retreating from New START at a critical moment. China has made clear it is determined to build an arsenal the size of Washington and Moscow’s. International inspectors have now discovered new evidence that Iran is making rapid progress in making near-bomb-grade nuclear fuel. North Korea spent the weekend testing its own intercontinental ballistic missiles. Every sign indicates the world may be on the verge of a new era of nuclear breakout.', 'More broadly, Mr. Putin sounded like a leader who was done with arms control after years of suspended inspections because of the pandemic, and then as confrontations with the United States and NATO escalated.', 'If that attitude holds, whoever is sitting in the Oval Office when the treaty expires in a bit more than 1,000 days may face a new world that will look, at first glance, similar to the one of a half-century ago, when arms races were in full swing and nations could field as many nuclear weapons as they wanted.', 'It was a reminder of how fragile the scant remaining restraints on nuclear weapons worldwide appear, 14 years after President Barack Obama, in a signature speech in Prague, called on all powers to work toward “a world without nuclear weapons.” While Mr. Obama acknowledged he might not see that day in his lifetime, it seemed, for a brief while, that the major nuclear powers were on a path to shrinking their arsenals — and relying less on nuclear weapons for defense and deterrence.', 'That day appears over, at least for the foreseeable future.', '“With Russia breaking treaties, China building up, North Korea testing missiles and Iran now close to weapons-grade uranium, it is a bad period for nuclear stability and restraint,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a senior adviser to Global Zero, a group that advocates the abolition of nuclear weapons, and a fellow at the Center for a New American Security.', 'Mr. Wolfsthal, who worked for President Biden when he was vice president, and then for Mr. Obama’s national security council on arms control, said he feared Mr. Putin’s declaration, while more a political declaration than a military one, “is likely to stoke the growing calls for the U.S. to expand its nuclear arsenal to both compete with Russia and show China they cannot catch us.”', 'Even before Mr. Putin spoke, implementation of the New START treaty was already in deep trouble; the State Department announced last month that the Russians were out of compliance. But on Tuesday, the Russian leader made clear that the United States could now forget about inspecting Russian nuclear sites, a central element of verifying compliance with the treaty’s mandates.', 'Not surprisingly, Mr. Putin argued that he was forced into his decision by American action. “They want to inflict ‘strategic defeat’ on us,” he said, picking up a phrase that American officials have used to describe their desired outcome for Russia in the war against Ukraine, “and climb on our nuclear facilities.”', 'He also noted that the Ukrainians had already used drones to attack strategic air bases in Russia, where the Russian Air Force keeps the bombers that can deliver nuclear weapons. (Those attacks happened, though they appear to have done limited damage.)', 'He said he wasn’t now about to allow inspectors to survey nuclear facilities, because they could pass their findings on to the Ukrainians to launch further attacks.', '“This is a theater of the absurd,” he said. “We know that the West is directly involved in the attempts of the Kyiv regime to strike at the bases.”', 'None of this changes the status quo ante very much. Nuclear inspections were suspended during the Covid pandemic, when inspectors on either side couldn’t get into Russia or the United States.', 'But over the past year, as travel restrictions lifted, Russians came up with reasons to deny inspections — and charged, as Mr. Putin did again on Tuesday, that the United States was not living up to its inspection requirements either. (American officials insisted several months ago that they have resolved access issues and would allow in Russian inspectors, as long as American inspectors had reciprocal rights.)', 'The United States retains considerable visibility over the Russian arsenal, chiefly with satellites that keep track of Russian nuclear movements. But there is a deeper worry. The five-year extension of New START that President Biden and Mr. Putin agreed upon in the first month of the Biden presidency is the only one permitted under the agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Obama’s tenure.', 'That means an entirely new treaty would have to be pieced together. And while American officials insist that they want to negotiate a new agreement, it is increasingly hard to imagine that happening in the next three years.', 'The reasons are numerous. First, there is virtually no communication between the two countries. The “strategic stability talks” that Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed upon in June 2021, at their only face-to-face meeting as presidents, started off with a promising dialogue.', 'The two sides agreed, briefly, to talk about traditional arms control and what to do with “novel” weapons, including a range of new nuclear devices under development by Russia. The Russians, in turn, want limits on what the United States calls “upgrades” to its own weapons. But those discussions never got off the ground; they were suspended after the invasion of Ukraine.', 'Second, trust between the two countries is virtually nonexistent. Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden have not spoken directly in more than a year. In the ensuing time, Mr. Biden has described the Russian leader as a war criminal, and Mr. Putin has called the American president the aggressor in Ukraine. In private, American officials sometimes concede that even if they negotiated a treaty, it would be almost impossible to imagine the Senate ratifying it under these conditions.', 'Third, the treaty as it stands does not cover the nuclear weapons the world worries about most in conflicts such as in Ukraine — the “battlefield nukes,” or tactical nuclear weapons, that Mr. Putin has episodically threatened to employ against Ukrainian forces. Russia has 2,000 or so; the United States has a few hundred.', 'Finally, another treaty only between Moscow and Washington no longer makes sense to many nuclear experts. The Pentagon now estimates that China, which is rapidly expanding its arsenal, could deploy 1,500 weapons in the next dozen years, matching the American and Russian arsenals. So an arms control treaty that left out one of the three major powers would be all but useless. And so far, China has showed no interest in joining negotiations — if there were any.', 'Still, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Tuesday, after Mr. Putin spoke, that he would be willing to negotiate a new treaty that was “clearly in the security interests of our country” and, he added, “in the security interests of Russia.”', 'Mr. Putin’s announcement, he added, was “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible.” But he suggested that the United States would not change its compliance with the treaty, no matter what Russia did.', '“I think it matters that we continue to act responsibly in this area,” he said. “It’s also something the rest of the world expects of us.”']"

Shear']",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/us/politics/biden-kyiv-ukraine.html,Biden’s Surreal and Secretive Journey Into a War Zone,"President Biden traveled covertly to the besieged Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, hoping to demonstrate American resolve to help defeat the Russian forces that invaded a year ago this week.","['WASHINGTON — As the train rumbled across the Ukrainian countryside through a long night, the view outside the window left little to see, just the occasional streetlight or shadows of buildings in the distance. But neither could those watching the train go by see who was inside, nor would they likely have guessed had they stopped to wonder.', 'Huddled aboard the anonymous train were President Biden and a skeleton team of advisers accompanied by armed and edgy Secret Service agents, embarking on a secret mission to visit Kyiv. As far as the world was concerned, Mr. Biden was back in Washington, home for the evening after a date night at an Italian restaurant.', 'In fact, he was on a journey unlike any other taken by a modern American president.', 'In an audacious move meant to demonstrate American resolve to help Ukraine defeat the Russian forces that invaded a year ago this week, Mr. Biden traveled covertly to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky and promise even more weapons for the country’s defenders. The visit produced an indelible image of the two presidents striding to a memorial for fallen soldiers in broad daylight even as an air-raid siren blared, a show of defiance of Moscow quickly beamed around the world.', '“I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Mr. Biden said during his five hours on the ground in Kyiv before leaving again. He was speaking, in effect, not just to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia but to fellow Americans back home doubting his decision to invest so deeply in Ukraine’s war. “It’s not just about freedom in Ukraine,” he said. “It’s about freedom of democracy at large.”', 'Never in Mr. Biden’s lifetime had a president ventured into a war zone that was not under the control of American forces, much less on a relatively slow-moving locomotive that would take nine and a half hours to reach its destination. During that time, he was potentially exposed to circumstances beyond the control of the hypervigilant security phalanx that normally seeks to shield a commander in chief from every conceivable physical danger and minimize his time outside a hardened shelter.', 'For much of the past year, in fact, most of the people around the president resisted any urge to go, on the assumption that it was too risky. But nearly a year after the Russian invasion, with Ukrainian troops faring far better than anyone expected at the start and other American and European leaders having made the trip, Mr. Biden and his team gambled that he could get in and out safely.', '“Of course there was still risk, and is still risk, in an endeavor like this,” Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters by phone from the train as it departed Kyiv for the return trip to Poland. “And President Biden felt that it was important to make this trip because of the critical juncture that we find ourselves at as we approach the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.”', 'It was a long journey and a surreal one. This was not how Mr. Biden was used to seeing Ukraine. He visited six times as vice president — three times in a six-month stretch — arriving in an American jet, gazing out the window in daylight to take in the sights of Kyiv from above. Now he was sneaking in under cover of darkness, arriving shortly after sunrise.', 'The trip had been in the works for months, aides said, as just a trusted few officials at the White House, Pentagon, Secret Service and intelligence agencies weighed the threat assessments. In meetings, Mr. Biden focused on the risk his visit could pose to others, not himself, one aide said.', 'Finally, the decision came to a head on Friday, when the president gathered with a handful of top advisers in the Oval Office and consulted with others by phone. He opted to go.', 'Mr. Biden was already set to travel to Poland for the anniversary. Often when presidents make secret stops in uncertain locations, the visits are added to the end of an existing trip. In this case, the White House decided to put it on the front end in hopes of keeping the secret.', 'The president played his part in the ruse. On Saturday evening, he and Jill Biden went to Mass at Georgetown University, then stopped by the National Museum of American History and finally went out to dinner at the Red Hen restaurant, where they enjoyed the rigatoni, widely considered the best in the nation’s capital. When the couple arrived back at the White House, most people might have assumed they were in for the night.', 'But a few hours after midnight, Mr. Biden was spirited out of the mansion and taken to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where a small coterie of aides, security agents, a medical team, a White House photographer and two journalists awaited him.', 'The two journalists, Sabrina Siddiqui from The Wall Street Journal and Evan Vucci from The Associated Press, had been summoned to the White House on Friday and sworn to secrecy. They were told to wait for further information in an email whose subject line would read: “Arrival instructions for the golf tourney.”', 'The two-person journalism pool was a radical departure from even other security-sensitive presidential trips, when the usual complement of 13 reporters and photographers was taken. But it would not be the only unusual feature of the trip.', 'Since Abraham Lincoln rode to the front lines outside Washington to watch battles in Northern Virginia during the Civil War, no sitting president has gotten that close to combat. Franklin D. Roosevelt visited North Africa; Lyndon B. Johnson went to Vietnam; Bill Clinton toured the Balkans; George W. Bush and Barack Obama traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan; and Donald J. Trump went to Afghanistan.', 'But in all those cases, they went to countries or areas under control of American forces or after hostilities had eased. In this case, the United States military would not be present in Ukraine, nor would it control the airspace. American military planes were spotted hovering in eastern Poland near the border during the trip, but officials said they never entered Ukrainian airspace out of concern that it would be taken as the sort of direct American intervention that Mr. Biden has avoided.', 'Arriving at Andrews on early Sunday morning, the two journalists surrendered their phones, not to be returned for 24 hours. They were taken not to the usual blue and white Boeing 747 designated as Air Force One when the president is on board but to an Air Force C-32, more typically used for domestic trips to airports with shorter runways. The plane was parked in the dark next to a hangar with shades drawn.', 'Mr. Biden arrived about 4 a.m., and the plane took off at 4:15 a.m. for the flight across the Atlantic. Mr. Biden was joined by a handful of aides — Mr. Sullivan; Jen O’Malley Dillon, a deputy chief of staff; and Annie Tomasini, the director of Oval Office operations. The plane touched down at Ramstein Air Base in Germany at 5:13 p.m. local time, where, with its shades down, it was refueled before taking off again at 6:29 p.m. It then made its way to Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport in Poland, landing at 7:57 p.m.', 'Mr. Biden was put in a motorcade with roughly 20 cars and driven without sirens for about an hour along a mostly empty highway to the small city of Przemyśl and taken to the train station where many thousands of refugees have arrived from Ukraine over the past year. Arriving at 9:15 p.m., the travelers found few people there and the stalls closed.', 'The motorcade pulled right up to a mostly purple train, with several cars painted blue with a yellow stripe along the middle to resemble the Ukrainian flag. Rarely does a president ride in any vehicle other than those of the Secret Service or American military, but flying into Ukraine is not deemed safe.', 'The train pulled away from the station without ceremony at 9:37 p.m. and crossed the border into Ukraine around 10 p.m. The White House was so intent on keeping the secret that it lied to reporters back in Washington. About four hours after Mr. Biden crossed the border into Ukraine, his office back in Washington issued a public schedule falsely stating that the president was still in the nation’s capital and not planning to leave for Europe until Monday evening.', 'Dressed in casual clothes, Mr. Biden had a hard time sleeping during the long train ride, according to a senior official who asked not to be identified describing the trip. The president spent the ride recalling his previous trips to Kyiv, including a speech to the Ukrainian Parliament and his remarks on his final trip in 2017. He read a briefing memo on the history of Kyiv back to its founding and reflected on his history with the city.', 'Talking with aides, Mr. Biden recounted his telephone call with Mr. Zelensky on Feb. 24 last year as Russia’s invasion began, marveling about how the Ukrainian leader told him at the time that he was not sure when they would speak again. Now, Mr. Biden mused to aides, here they were a year later about to meet face-to-face in Kyiv.', 'After the all-night trip, the train pulled into Kyiv-Pasazhyrsky station at 8 a.m. local time. The platform had been cleared. On a sunny day with blue skies and a brisk chill in the air, Mr. Biden disembarked, now wearing a blue suit with a tie featuring Ukrainian colors. He was greeted by Bridget A. Brink, the American ambassador.', '“It’s good to be back in Kyiv,” he said.', 'During his five hours in the city, he met with Mr. Zelensky at Mariinsky Palace, joined him in laying a wreath at the Wall of Remembrance at St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery and stopped by the United States Embassy to meet with its staff.', 'Then he headed back to the same train station, departing at 1:10 p.m. On the long meandering train ride back to Poland, the senior official said the president issued a series of directions on military, economic and diplomatic areas to help Ukraine. He was seized with the meetings he had just had. Once again, he could not sleep much.', 'He arrived at the Przemyśl Główny station at 8:45 p.m. local time, and he headed back to the airport for a flight to Warsaw, where he will deliver a speech on Tuesday. His mind, aides said, remained on his last stop.', '“Kyiv,” he had said before leaving, “has captured a part of my heart, I must say.”']"

Putin of Russia will become vividly apparent in a rare split-screen moment on Tuesday.,"['WARSAW — President Biden’s sudden appearance in Kyiv’s presidential palace on Monday morning was intended first as a morale booster for shellshocked Ukrainians in the midst of a bleak winter of power outages and a bitter war of attrition.', 'But it was also the first of several direct challenges on this trip to President Vladimir V. Putin, who a year ago this week believed the Ukrainian capital would become Russian-controlled territory again in a matter of days, moving Mr. Putin closer to his ambition of restoring the empire of Peter the Great.', '“Putin’s war of conquest is failing,” Mr. Biden declared from the palace, his very presence there, alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, meant to symbolize Russia’s failure to take a capital that today remains brimming with life, its restaurants overflowing even as warning sirens blare.', '“One year later,” he said, “Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands.”', 'The war in Ukraine is about power and the principle of territorial sovereignty, and whether the Western-designed global order that Americans thought would prevail for decades will, in fact, survive new challenges from Moscow and Beijing. But it is increasingly a contest between two aging Cold Warriors, one 70 years old and another who just turned 80, who have been circling each other for years, and now are engaged in everything short of direct battle.', 'On Tuesday the vastly different world views of these two leaders will become vividly apparent in a rare split-screen moment. They will both deliver speeches, several hours and 800 miles apart, vowing to stick with the war until the other retreats. Mr. Putin will go first, marking the first anniversary of his ill-fated invasion with what, by all indications, will be a renewal of a strategy that has already led to 200,000 Russian casualties, by British and American estimates, and as many as 60,000 Russians killed.', 'Mr. Putin will make the case anew that he is not only saving Ukraine from “Nazism,” but saving Russia itself from being overrun by NATO — a claim that seems ridiculous to Europeans but that has become a rallying cry in Moscow. If the past year is any guide, he is almost certain to cast his war as a battle for the restoration of Russia’s historic lands. American intelligence officials say they are picking up indications that he may soon mobilize more Russians into the military, adding hundreds of thousands to the 300,000 already called up.', 'Hours later, from Warsaw’s ancient Royal Castle, on a hill over the Polish capital, Mr. Biden is expected to build on the case he made in Kyiv on Monday morning, that in the battle between democracy and autocracy, the former has emerged the winner of the first year of what promises to be a long conflict.', 'Mr. Biden was in Kyiv on Monday for less than six hours before the Secret Service whisked him out of the city. (Notably, the White House informed the Kremlin of Mr. Biden’s impending visit before the president arrived, not as a diplomatic courtesy but for what Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, called “deconfliction purposes” — essentially, to avoid a Russian strike, accidental or otherwise. Mr. Sullivan added, “I won’t get into how they responded.”)', 'The covert nature of the Kyiv visit, and the vastly different world views the speeches will represent, underscore the degree to which the battle between these two men has echoes of exactly what Mr. Biden said he wanted to avoid: a replay of the worst days of the Cold War.', 'It is not a direct parallel, though. This time China is a more powerful player, which is why American officials spent the weekend publicly warning the government of Xi Jinping not to provide “lethal support” that an increasingly stretched Russian military desperately needs.', 'In fact, just as Mr. Biden arrived in Kyiv, China’s most senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, arrived in Moscow, for meetings that promise to be far friendlier than his clash on Saturday night with Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state. American officials say Mr. Wang and other Chinese officials want to help Mr. Putin confront what they view as an arrogant, hypocritical and declining United States. But China says the relationship has its limits — to the point that Mr. Xi publicly warned Russia against using nuclear weapons.', 'Mr. Biden has his own confrontations with Mr. Xi, over surveillance, technology, China’s arms buildup and Taiwan. But his face-off with Mr. Putin is more direct and more visceral, perhaps the most personal confrontation between superpower leaders since Kennedy and Khrushchev. And even in the worst moments of that standoff — the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 — the two leaders were exchanging civil letters and looking for a way out. They ultimately found one.', 'Twenty-one months ago, when Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin met face-to-face for the only time since Mr. Biden came to office, that kind of wary relationship still seemed possible. They met on the somewhat neutral ground of Geneva, in a library dominated by a huge globe that seemed a reminder of the fact that they were, once again, dividing up the world into allies and adversaries. Mr. Putin praised Mr. Biden as “a very balanced, professional man” and “very experienced.” Mr. Biden played to Mr. Putin’s ego at the outset of the summit by referring to the United States and Russia as “two great powers.”', 'The hope was that they could find some common ground — and they emerged agreeing to set up government-to-government talks on two huge points of tension: Abating ransomware attacks on American infrastructure, hospitals and governments, and “strategic stability talks” to map out the future of arms control. There were a few promising meetings.', 'They spoke twice after that, via a video link. The last time, on Feb. 12, 2022, was marked by a warning from Mr. Biden that if Mr. Putin pulled the trigger and ordered his troops massing on Ukraine’s border to invade there would be “swift and severe costs on Russia.” An aide who witnessed the call said Mr. Putin “shrugged, like we’ve heard that before,” and denied he had military action in mind.', 'They have not spoken since, and the follow-on talks they agreed to in Geneva were halted. By this past weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris, appearing at the Munich Security Conference, was accusing Russia of “crimes against humanity” and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that the West had to be prepared for “prolonged conflict” — and arm Ukraine and itself accordingly. There was more discussion of how to produce 155 mm howitzer rounds and where to find more Leopard 2 tanks to send to Ukraine than there was of possible diplomatic solutions.', '“Everyone — Ukraine, Europe and now countries in Asia — wants to rearm,” Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security and a former Republican national security official, wrote after the Munich conference. And he noted a frisson of anxiety about whether the West’s aid to Ukraine could continue at current levels for much longer — meaning that “in a long war of attrition, Moscow might have the upper hand.”', 'Mr. Zelensky, appearing by video, had one message to his weapons suppliers. “We need to hurry up,” he said. “We need speed.”', 'And for all the good feeling created by Mr. Biden’s visit on Monday, Mr. Zelensky is unlikely to conclude that Mr. Biden is hurrying enough. Mr. Biden remains worried, aides report, that the F-16 fighters and long-range missiles that Mr. Zelensky demands could provoke a wider, more direct conflict with Russia, because they could reach deep into Russian territory. And that, in turn, might tempt Mr. Putin to renew his threats to reach into his arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons.', 'It is unclear how Mr. Biden’s visit will affect Mr. Putin’s speech, which presumably was drafted long before the American president’s surprise, and somewhat taunting, appearance. It was Mr. Biden’s eighth visit to Kyiv, he noted as he sat with Mr. Zelensky in front of a fireplace.', 'But Mr. Putin’s speech will be his first state-of-the-nation address since 2021. He skipped it last year, analysts believe, because he lacked good news to share amid Russia’s setbacks at the front.', 'But the approaching anniversary of the invasion, along with a lack of clarity even among Mr. Putin’s supporters about the nature of his exact goals in Ukraine, may have forced his hand. The speech is now widely anticipated to include wide-ranging attacks on the West, grounded in Mr. Putin’s contention that the United States is using Ukraine to wage a proxy war against Russia.', '“I believe that President Putin’s address won’t have anything good for the liberals,” Konstantin Malofeyev, an ultraconservative Russian business magnate and a prominent cheerleader of the invasion, said in a phone interview over the weekend, dismissing the possibility that Mr. Putin could use his speech to try to lower tensions with the West.', 'Russia, Mr. Malofeyev went on, will keep fighting until it achieves victory in Ukraine “because our commander in chief himself understands that we now have no other choice.”', 'Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote that while Mr. Putin’s address was already expected to be very hawkish, “additional edits could be made now to make it even tougher.”', 'Russian media wasted no time casting Mr. Biden’s visit to Kyiv as proving Mr. Putin’s contention that America is behind the fighting. RIA Novosti, the Russian state news agency, quoted an analyst as saying that Mr. Biden’s visit showed that Mr. Zelensky’s government was “an instrument of the collective West.”', 'And as Mr. Putin has pivoted from engagement to aggression, Mr. Biden became the leader of the “Western elites” who, Mr. Putin declared last September, are Russia’s “enemy.” In the Kremlin’s propaganda, Mr. Biden is now invariably portrayed as senile, sleepy and out of touch.', 'Tuesday’s succession of speeches will also reflect the two presidents’ different constituencies and political vulnerabilities.', 'Mr. Biden’s speech will be open to the public in Poland. Mr. Putin will speak in a hall across Red Square from the Kremlin, with Russia’s ruling elite — regional governors, lawmakers and other officials — in attendance.', 'For Mr. Biden, it is the ever-shifting political winds inside the United States that represent the greatest vulnerability to his ability to stay the course in Ukraine — already there are objections on the far left and far right, though the core of Republican and Democratic support has held.', 'For Mr. Putin, the big concern is that Moscow’s disparate pro-Kremlin elites could fall out of line if Russia’s military continues to struggle.', 'But even Russia admits there is a lot on the line. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, once treated the war as a small operation, a sideshow that ordinary Russians didn’t have to think much about. Now, that fiction can no longer be contained.', '“The special military operation affects our whole life, the life of the continent, in one way or another,” Mr. Peskov said in a Russian state television interview aired on Sunday. “So one should expect that the president will devote a lot of attention to it.”']"

Putin’s invasion has met setback after setback. But its effect at home has been very different.","['The grievances, paranoia and imperialist mind-set that drove President Vladimir V. Putin to invade Ukraine have seeped deep into Russian life after a year of war — a broad, if uneven, societal upheaval that has left the Russian leader more dominant than ever at home.', 'Schoolchildren collect empty cans to make candles for soldiers in the trenches, while learning in a new weekly class that the Russian military has always liberated humanity from “aggressors who seek world domination.”', 'Museums and theaters, which remained islands of artistic freedom during previous crackdowns, have seen that special status evaporate, their antiwar performers and artists expunged.

But at home, facing little resistance, Mr. Putin’s year of war has allowed him to go further than many thought possible in reshaping Russia in his image.', '“Liberalism in Russia is dead forever, thank God,” Konstantin Malofeyev, an ultraconservative business tycoon, bragged in a phone interview on Saturday. “The longer this war lasts, the more Russian society is cleansing itself from liberalism and the Western poison.”', 'That the invasion has dragged on for a year has made Russia’s transformation go far deeper, he said, than it would have had Mr. Putin’s hopes for a swift victory been realized.', '“If the Blitzkrieg had succeeded, nothing would have changed,” he said.', 'The Kremlin for years sought to keep Mr. Malofeyev at arm’s length, even as he funded pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and called for Russia to be reformed into an empire of “traditional values,” free of Western influence. But that changed after the invasion, as Mr. Putin turned “traditional values” into a rallying cry — signing a new anti-gay law, for instance — while styling himself as another Peter the Great retaking lost Russian lands.', 'Most important, Mr. Malofeyev said, Russia’s liberals have either been silenced or have fled the country, while Western companies have left voluntarily.', 'That change was evident last Wednesday at a gathering off the traffic-jammed Garden Ring road in Moscow, where some of the most prominent rights activists who have remained in Russia came together for the latest of many recent farewells: The Sakharov Center, a human rights archive that was a liberal hub for decades, was opening its last exhibit before being forced to shut under a new law.', 'The center’s chairman, Vyacheslav Bakhmin, once a Soviet dissident, told the assembled crowd that “what we just couldn’t have imagined two years ago or even a year ago is happening today.”', '“A new system of values has been built,” Aleksandr Daniel, an expert on Soviet dissidents, said afterward. “Brutal and archaic public values.”', 'A year ago, as Washington warned of an imminent invasion, most Russians dismissed the possibility; Mr. Putin, after all, had styled himself as a peace-loving president who would never attack another country. So after the invasion started — stunning some of the president’s closest aides — the Kremlin scrambled to adjust its propaganda to justify it.', 'It was the West that went to war against Russia by backing “Nazis” who took power in Ukraine in 2014, the false message went, and the goal of Mr. Putin’s “special military operation” was to end the war the West had started.', 'In a series of addresses aimed at shoring up domestic support, Mr. Putin cast the invasion as a near-holy war for Russia’s very identity, declaring that it was fighting to prevent liberal gender norms and acceptance of homosexuality from being forced upon it by an aggressive West.', 'The full power of the state was deployed to spread and enforce that message. National television channels, all controlled by the Kremlin, dropped entertainment programming in favor of more news and political talk shows; schools were directed to add a regular flag-raising ceremony and “patriotic” education; the police hunted down people for offenses like antiwar Facebook posts, helping to push hundreds of thousands of Russians out of the country.', '“Society in general has gone off the rails,” Sergei Chernyshov, who runs a private high school in the Siberian metropolis of Novosibirsk, said in a phone interview. “They’ve flipped the ideas of good and evil.”', 'Mr. Chernyshov, one of the few Russian school heads who has spoken out against the war, described the narrative of Russian soldiers fighting in defense of their nation as so easily digestible that much of society truly came to believe it — especially since the message meshed seamlessly with one of the most emotionally evocative chapters of Russian history: their nation’s victory in World War II.', 'A nationwide campaign urging children to make candles for soldiers has become so popular, he said, that anyone questioning it in a school chat group might be called a “Nazi and an accomplice of the West.”', 'At the same time, he argued, daily life has changed little for Russians without a family member fighting in Ukraine, which has hidden or assuaged the costs of the war. Western officials estimate that at least 200,000 Russians have been killed or wounded in Ukraine, a far more serious toll than analysts had predicted when the war began. Yet the economy has suffered much less than analysts predicted, with Western sanctions having failed to drastically reduce average Russians’ quality of life even as many Western brands departed.', '“One of the scariest observations, I think, is that for the most part, nothing has changed for people,” Mr. Chernyshov said, describing the urban rhythm of restaurants and concerts and his students going on dates. “This tragedy gets pushed to the periphery.”', 'In Moscow, Mr. Putin’s new ideology of war is on display at the Victory Museum — a sprawling hilltop compound dedicated to the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. One new exhibit, “NATOzism,” declares that “the purpose of creating NATO was to achieve world domination.” A second, “Everyday Nazism,” includes artifacts from Ukraine’s Azov Battalion, which has far-right connections, as evidence for the false assertion that Ukraine is committing “genocide” against Russians.', '“It was scary, creepy and awful,” one patron named Liza, 19, said of what the exhibit had shown her, declining to give her last name because of the political sensitivity of the subject. She said she was distressed to learn of this behavior by the Ukrainians, as presented by Russian propaganda. “It shouldn’t be that way,” she said, signaling her support for Mr. Putin’s invasion.', 'Hundreds of students were visiting on a recent afternoon, and primary schoolchildren marched in green army caps as their chaperone called out, “Left, left, one, two, three!” and addressed them as “soldiers.” In the main hall, the studio of Victory TV — a channel started in 2020 to focus on World War II — was filming a live talk show.', '“The framework of the conflict helped people to come to terms with it,” said Denis Volkov, the director of the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow. “The West is against us. Here are our soldiers, there are the enemy soldiers, and in this framework, you have to take sides.”', 'Weeks after launching his invasion, Mr. Putin declared that Russia faced a much-needed “self-purification of society.” He has glibly wished “all the best!” to Western businesses that have left the country and said their departures created “unique development opportunities” for Russian companies.', 'But in Khabarovsk, a city on the Chinese border in Russia’s Far East, Vitaly Blazhevich, a local English teacher, says the locals miss Western brands like H&M, the clothing retailer. When it came to the war, he went on, the dominant emotion was one of passive acceptance and the hope that things would end soon.', '“People are nostalgic for what turned out to have been the good times,” he said.', 'Mr. Blazhevich taught at a Khabarovsk state university until he was forced to resign on Friday, he said, for criticizing Mr. Putin in a YouTube interview with Radio Liberty, the American-funded Russian-language news outlet. They were the kind of comments that would probably not have been punished before the war. Now, he said, the government’s repression of dissent “is like a steamroller” — “everyone is just being rolled into the asphalt.”', 'Mr. Malofeyev, the conservative tycoon, said Russia still needed another year “for society to cleanse itself completely from the last fateful years.” He said that anything short of “victory” in Ukraine, complete with a parade in Kyiv, could still cause some of the last year’s transformation to be undone.', '“If there is a cease-fire in the course of the spring,” he said, “then a certain liberal comeback is possible.”', 'In Moscow, at the farewell event at the Sakharov Center, some of the older attendees noted that in the arc of Russian history, a Kremlin crackdown on dissent was nothing new. Yan Rachinsky, chairman of Memorial, the rights group forced to disband in late 2021, said the Soviets banned so much “that there was nothing left to ban.”', '“But you can’t ban people from thinking,” Mr. Rachinsky went on. “What the authorities are doing today does not guarantee them any longevity.”']"

In an address late Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that he was “grateful” for the “important statements” of support from Western officials in Munich.', '“We received strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people,” he said.', 'Russia responded sharply to Vice President Kamala Harris, who told the conference on Saturday that the United States had determined that Moscow had committed “crimes against humanity” in Ukraine and pledged to hold accountable “all those who have perpetrated these crimes,” as well as their superiors.', 'In a statement later Saturday, Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to Washington, dismissed the comments “as an attempt, unprecedented in terms of its cynicism, to demonize Russia.”', 'Experts warn that any legal process to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity would be long and tedious, with arrests or convictions far from assured. And while Mr. Zelensky’s allies have supplied Ukraine with ever more powerful weapons, it is not clear that his latest pleas — including for fighter jets and long-range missiles — will be met by Western leaders wary of provoking Russia into further aggression.', 'China, Russia’s most influential partner, delivered a typically calibrated message at the conference. Mr. Wang, China’s top diplomat, told the gathering that “nuclear wars must not be fought,” a potential signal to Moscow that China will not tolerate the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as Russian officials have at times threatened.', 'At the same time, Mr. Wang sought to deflect blame for the war away from Russia, arguing that “some forces might not want to see peace talks” and “might have strategic goals larger than Ukraine itself.” That language echoed Kremlin claims, rejected by the West, that Moscow was willing to engage in good-faith peace talks and that NATO aimed to subjugate Russia.', 'He met Saturday evening with Mr. Blinken, in the first high-level diplomatic exchange between the two sides since the U.S. response to a recent Chinese spy balloon overflight.', 'A detailed readout of the meeting between the two top officials by Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, did not mention any discussions about Russia and Ukraine. It did say that Mr. Wang criticized U.S. leaders for “using all means to block and suppress China.”', 'Ukrainian officials have been warning of a potential Russian escalation timed to the first anniversary of the invasion and heavy fighting was reported Sunday around the city of Kreminna, a small but vital pocket of land in the Donbas region.', 'Serhiy Haidai, the head of the regional military administration, called the situation around Kreminna “difficult” and said shelling was constant. “Russians are trying to find a spot to penetrate our defenses,” he told Ukrainian television.', 'Elsewhere, Russian shelling killed a family of three people and wounded at least four other people in the southern region of Kherson, local officials said.']"

It was just a constant nightmare.”', 'For weeks, she had followed the ominous news of Russian troops massing on Ukraine’s border and decided on Feb. 23 to enlist as a reservist. The next day, the largest land war in Europe since World War II began.', 'As explosions shook Kyiv, Ms. Bondarenko took the subway to report for duty, uncertain the recruiting office would take her without finished paperwork or a fitness exam.', 'But in the chaotic swirl of volunteers, officers asked no questions. They handed her a rifle and 120 bullets, and assigned her to a unit expecting to fight in urban combat if the Russian Army broke into the capital. She was only one recruit in a huge influx of volunteers who swelled the size of Ukrainian forces — from about 260,000 soldiers to about one million today — and whose lives were transformed by the war.', 'In a recent interview, Ms. Bondarenko recalled the intense stress of those early days. Unaccustomed to the sounds of artillery, she said, she expected to be hit after every blast. She thought she would die.', 'Step by step, she learned how to be a soldier. Fellow volunteers showed her how to load, aim and fire her Kalashnikov rifle. They practiced trench fighting and other tactics.', 'During the weekslong battle for Kyiv, Ms. Bondarenko and about 150 other volunteers, almost all men, lived in a shopping mall, rotating through shifts at checkpoints in the city. She and two other women changed in a bathroom away from the men.', 'It was so cold at night she slept hugging one of the other female soldiers. Slowly, sleeping bags, mats and warm uniforms turned up — and the unit eventually made it to a barracks.', 'Not all of the new recruits needed training. Eight years of fighting against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has schooled a generation of Ukrainian soldiers — about 500,000 — in trench warfare on the plains, the type of combat dominating the war today. Many veterans returned to active service when the full-scale invasion began.', 'In the weeks after Ukraine fended off Russia from the capital, and as Russian troops retreated in the spring, the fighting shifted to the east. Ms. Bondarenko was offered a chance to resign or take a position in a desk job or as a cook.', 'She overcame her fears and chose to stay with the infantry, living in the barracks and training for campaigns to come.', 'Like other recruits without experience, Ms. Bondarenko learned on the job: how to find trip wires and explosive traps, to duck for cover from shells, to provide battlefield first aid.', 'At first, she worried about her abilities. Bookish and shy, she never had any interest in the military, and knew nothing of weapons or wars. But on patrols and at the firing range, handling supplies and learning tactics, her confidence grew.', '“It was pleasant when the guys said, ‘It’s working out with you,’” she said. “And they said, ‘I would go into battle with you.’”', 'Her brigade was stationed in a village south of Kyiv, where soldiers formed relationships with residents: They frequented a shop for snacks, and Ms. Bondarenko grew close to a local math teacher.', 'But at spring’s end, they had to say goodbye. They were heading toward the northeastern Kharkiv region, toward the front.', 'In the northeast, the unit came under near constant Russian shelling over the summer. Ms. Bondarenko helped handle logistics and supplies to keep Ukraine’s forces fighting.', 'Patriotism, and learning the history of Moscow’s repression of Ukrainians, had motivated her to enlist in the first place, she said.', 'She had moved to Kyiv from a village in central Ukraine for university studies, arriving shortly before mass street protests toppled a pro-Russia president in 2014. During the political awakening that followed, she re-evaluated her family’s history and found injustices from Russia’s long rule in Ukraine.', 'During Soviet times, she said, a hydroelectric dam had flooded her village, Khudyaki, but the authorities did nothing to relocate residents. Villagers had to salvage what they could from their homes and rebuild on higher ground.', '“When I became older, I understood how history was taught incorrectly in schools,” she said.', 'Even as green new soldiers swelled its ranks, Ukraine adopted dozens of new, Western-donated weapons. By the fall, it had gained strength. Ukraine counterattacked and, upending long-held ideas of the balance of military force in Europe, defeated the Russian Army on the battlefield in two successful offensives, in Kharkiv and Kherson regions.', 'Over the New Year’s holiday, Ms. Bondarenko was given a respite. She returned to Kyiv, where she got to indulge in joys from before the war: a new haul of books delivered to her apartment; coffee with friends; time with her sister and 4-year-old niece.', 'She also used her leave to visit her 67-year-old mother, Hanna Bondarenko, at her village in central Ukraine, where she had grown up speaking Ukrainian in contrast to the Russian spoken in Kyiv’s cafes. But her anger at Russia had simmered as Moscow fomented fighting over the past eight years, and she had long switched to speaking Ukrainian in public.', 'When Russia invaded, her mother said, she at least felt a sense of relief that her daughter would not be drafted. “I was happy I didn’t have a son because I didn’t have to worry about him going off to war,” she said. “I never imagined my daughter would sign up.”', 'Her daughter said she tried to stave off some feelings while her unit was deployed. She feels guilt about her mother’s fears for her, and misses teaching and her boyfriend. She keeps a box of letters from former students at home.', '“When I am away on the base or in the field, I try to shut down emotionally,” she said. ', 'The backpack she carried held a small part of her life as a teacher: books. Some were children’s books that she sometimes read to cheer up fellow soldiers.', 'But she said that she needed to serve her country, meaning that, before long, she had to make another round of goodbyes. Parting with her boyfriend in Kyiv, she said, she thought of his daily fears and their hopes for the future.', 'The relationship, she said, “shows me that even in the dark, there can be light.”', 'Of the many volunteers she has met over the past year, many were deployed to eastern Ukraine, where fighting is raging, and Ms. Bondarenko knows some who have been killed.', 'She has not yet fired her rifle in combat, but if her platoon is sent to the front, she said, she feels ready to fight.', '“I am an infantry soldier now,” she said.']"

Putin of Russia “must fail,” calling Russia’s war “catastrophic and unjustified.”', 'At the same time, he used words like “dialogue” and “re-engagement” to describe an eventual interaction with Russia in the future, terms that Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, avoided in a speech immediately before Mr. Macron’s that was uniformly resolute and offered no prediction of an end to the year-old war.', 'Answering questions in English after delivering a speech in French, Mr. Macron said: “Now the question is how to resist? How to help the Ukrainians to make on the ground something which will force Russia to come back to the table on the conditions of Ukraine.”', 'But Ukrainian military resistance could not be the whole story, he told the audience. “None of us will change geography” and Russia is “on European soil,” he said. Given that, “we will have to negotiate.”', 'Of all major Western leaders, Mr. Macron has most persistently referred to the inevitability of negotiation with Mr. Putin’s Russia. He has stood out in arguing that peace talks must include security “guarantees to Russia.”', 'Such talk has sometimes irritated Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, as well as leaders of European Union and NATO states bordering Russia, who have long seen their Western allies as being naïve about the threat of Russian aggression. They contend that only an outright defeat of Mr. Putin — whatever that may mean — is acceptable.', 'Mr. Macron’s intricately calibrated argument on Friday, combining expressions of resolve with the conviction that reason will one day demand a compromise to end the war, was typical of a leader who has earned the sobriquet the “at-the-same-time president” because of his penchant for back-and-forth analyses.', 'The goal of negotiation, he said in response to questions, would have to be “an imperfect balance” that preserves “something sustainable for Russia itself.” But he added that it was far too early to try to formulate any security arrangement that would end the war on terms acceptable to Kyiv and Moscow.', '“This is not the time for dialogue,” he said. The West must face the fact that although the “weeks and months” ahead could be “decisive,” the war might last much longer, Mr. Macron said. It was critical, he argued, for Europe and the United States “to be credible over the long term,” if Russia was to come to the negotiating table in an acceptable way.', 'Mr. Macron appears to have traveled some distance since declaring last year that it was necessary to avoid “humiliating” Russia and telling Ukraine it would have to wait “decades” to join the European Union. While he spoke to Mr. Putin on a regular basis just before the war and in its first several weeks — clocking 17 calls between early December 2021 and late March 2022 — Mr. Macron has not spoken to the Russian leader since September.', 'A meeting this month in Paris between Mr. Macron and Mr. Zelensky was effusive in its tone of mutual friendship and support. But an interview given just before the meeting, by Mr. Zelensky to the French newspaper Le Figaro and the German weekly magazine “Der Spiegel,” revealed lingering tensions.', 'In response to a question about whether Mr. Macron had changed, the Ukrainian leader said: “I believe he has changed and that this time he has changed for real.” Mr. Zelensky clearly meant that, in his view, Mr. Macron had fully and unambiguously embraced the Ukrainian cause.', 'The barbed remark did not go unnoticed by Mr. Macron, officials close to him told the French daily Le Monde.', 'Mr. Macron has insisted that his views have remained largely constant: denunciation of Russia’s illegal aggression against a sovereign state; support for Ukraine’s war effort to the point of “victory” (a word Mr. Scholz has declined to use to describe the objective of German support for Kyiv); and insistence that peace negotiations will be needed one day with Moscow.', 'He has also been insistent on the need to bolster European military capacity alongside NATO, and abandon the mind-set of relying on the United States for protection. He called on European states on Friday to “invest massively in our defense,” citing planned French military spending of $427 billion between 2024 and 2030, or $107 billion more than in the preceding six-year period.', '“It is on the basis of a mental and material rearmament that, I believe, we will allow Europe to occupy its rightful place in future security arrangements,” Mr. Macron said.', 'Mr. Scholz also spoke of the need to better integrate and bolster the European defense industry, but alluded repeatedly to Germany’s intense cooperation with the United States throughout the war.', 'Mr. Macron told the audience in Munich that Russia had failed on several fronts since invading Ukraine: Its conviction that victory would be quick proved baseless; it had become a force for “disorder” in the world, as symbolized by the “neo-Mafioso” Wagner mercenaries operating as an arm of the Kremlin; it had consolidated the very Ukrainian nationhood it denied; and it had bolstered a NATO alliance that Mr. Putin demonizes, with Sweden and Finland having decided to join.', 'A year ago, Mr. Macron said, Mr. Putin had told him in Moscow that Wagner operatives “were not ours, in fact they pose us problems in Russia.” Mr. Macron conceded that he had believed Mr. Putin at the time, but said the truth of Wagner’s criminal activities as agents of the Kremlin was now evident.', 'France and Russia have clashed in several African countries where Wagner is active. Moscow has waged an intense propaganda war against France, portraying it as an exploitative former colonial power in Africa.', 'Still, Mr. Macron noted, Russia endures — as does Mr. Putin.', '“I don’t believe for a second in regime change” in Moscow, Mr. Macron said, describing regime changes around the world in “the past decades” as “a total failure.”']"

Most of these probes were shot down.”', 'The purpose of the balloons remains under investigation, it said, although given the conflict there seemed to be slightly less mystery about them than a Chinese balloon and other objects that have been detected recently drifting over North America.', 'Russia “uses such flying objects for reconnaissance or to confuse air defense systems,” Yuriy Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian air force, said on national television. Although the balloons are of different sizes, he said, they can be used to dangle aloft simple, small reflectors.', 'The rudimentary reflectors are meant to disorient missiles that use radar to home in on their targets. Russia has used the reflectors before to try to avert attacks on valuable targets like the Kerch Bridge, which connects Russia to Crimea, but it has not previously attached them to balloons.', 'Russia has not commented on the accusations from Ukraine or ones from neighboring countries that also have said they detected balloons.', 'It was not clear whether Russia just recently introduced the balloons in Ukraine, or whether they were previously considered so unremarkable that they drew attention only after the Chinese balloon and other unidentified objects were shot down over the United States in recent weeks.', 'On Tuesday, Mr. Ihnat reported the Russians on Sunday had used balloons over the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. He said those appeared to be filled with gas and about one to one and half meters in diameter — just large enough to lift the reflectors.', 'In addition to reconnaissance and possible distraction, Mr. Ihnat said the Russians were trying to get Ukraine to expend valuable resources, including antiaircraft missiles, to shoot them down.', 'The balloons are hardly new. The Soviet military had a balloon program, which has continued under the Russian Federation, according to Michael Kofman, a military expert and the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va.', 'Experts in Ukraine and the United States suggested that the most likely reason for the balloons was to trigger Ukrainian air defense systems. That could reveal their location so that Russia could later target the positions for attack, or could prompt Ukraine to waste ammunition.', '“It gets them to expend valuable defense ammunition on what, at the end of the day, are balloons,” Mr. Kofman said. The balloons are not terribly reliable for use in deflecting weapons, he added.', 'High-flying balloons that drift on air currents can be hard to detect. Radar systems used for territorial defense are generally designed to focus on incoming aircraft, missiles and other fast-moving objects. They are often set to avoid picking up things moving slowly, like balloons sent aloft to help predict weather patterns.', 'Elsewhere, Moldova briefly closed its airspace because of a presumed air balloon that entered its territory on Tuesday. The country’s government said it had closed the airspace for more than three hours to ensure the security of passenger flights after an “object similar to a weather balloon” was detected near the Ukrainian border.', 'The airspace was reopened once the object was found to be harmless, said Daniel Voda, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.

Its significance comes more from the amount of blood spilled to claim it.', '“Even if Bakhmut were to fall, it would not have a strategic impact on the overall war,” said the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby. “I would go so far as to say it won’t even have necessarily a strategic impact on the fighting in that part of the country.”', 'In Brussels, Western officials deflected questions about whether Ukraine would win its campaign to secure still more powerful weapons to use against its Russian enemy.', 'Already, allies have given all manner of different Western weapon systems to Kyiv’s war effort, most recently pledging to supply it with battle tanks. Mr. Austin said the priority now was to make sure Ukrainian troops were trained on how to use these weapons effectively, describing it as “a monumental task” that is “really the focus of our conversation today.”', 'Having won a commitment of tanks and armored fighting vehicles in January, Ukrainian officials quickly turned to the next item on their wish list: fighter planes. President Biden has said he is opposed to sending U.S.-made F-16 jets to Ukraine, and other allies have also appeared reluctant. But Britain, Kyiv’s second-biggest arms supplier after the United States, said last week that it would start training Ukrainian pilots on Western jets.', 'Asked in Brussels on Tuesday whether fighter jets had been discussed, Mr. Austin, the American defense secretary, said, “I don’t have any announcement to make today.”', 'Mr. Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, also appeared to be treading carefully.', '“The issue of aircraft is not the most urgent issue now,” he said. “But it is an ongoing discussion.”', 'Apart from planes, Ukrainian officials have said that they are in dire need of more ammunition for the Soviet-era T-72 tanks they already possess — which is not compatible with NATO weaponry — as well as artillery shells to work with Western-supplied heavy guns. Before the meeting, Mr. Stoltenberg said that the war “is consuming an enormous amount of munitions and depleting allied stockpiles,” and that allies would discuss how to expand production to support Ukraine and replenish their own arsenals.', 'Even as NATO countries try to ramp up manufacturing, waiting times to secure new large-caliber ammunition have grown from 12 months to 28 months, Mr. Stoltenberg said.', 'The Pentagon is already racing to increase production of artillery shells by 500 percent within two years, pushing conventional ammunition production to levels not seen since the Korean War.', 'The tanks that the United States and several other NATO allies have committed to supplying are expected to take months to arrive — and require still other types of ammunition.', 'In Brussels on Tuesday, NATO officials also discussed a reshaping of the alliance caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is nearing its first anniversary: an expansion to include two long-nonaligned countries, Finland and Sweden.', 'Mr. Stoltenberg raised the possibility that the applications of Sweden and Finland to join NATO might be considered separately, appearing to open the door to a split decision on membership.', 'The long-held thinking at NATO has been that the Nordic neighbors should join at the same time. His comments caused some immediate concern among member states because they appeared to lessen the alliance’s leverage to persuade Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to drop objections to Sweden’s bid to join.', 'Mr. Stoltenberg sought to allay those concerns.', '“The main question is not whether Finland and Sweden are ratified together,” he told reporters before a meeting of NATO defense ministers. “The main question is that they are both ratified as full members as soon as possible.”']"

Serhiy Cherevaty, the spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern military command, said in an interview on Monday.', 'He said that Ukrainian troops had repelled 19 assaults on Bakhmut over the previous 24 hours, but that no watershed moment had been reached. The city, he said, “is under Ukrainian control.”', 'Bakhmut lies at the heart of a brutal, monthslong battle. After leveling much of the city with artillery, the Russians now appear to have surrounded it on three sides, and to have captured several towns and villages around it. Ukraine’s military said on Monday that street fighting had also begun in two of Bakhmut’s neighborhoods.', 'For months, volunteers from Ukraine and abroad had taken extraordinary risks to evacuate civilians and provide medical care in Bakhmut, operating three heating and aid shelters in a city that has mostly lacked electricity or heat. (Pete Reed, an American volunteer medic, was killed in Bakhmut this month.) The presence of aid workers in this crucible of violence, despite the grave risks, had helped reassure the remaining residents that Ukraine had not abandoned them.', '“We are fighting for people’s hearts,” one volunteer, Mykhailo Puryshev, said in a telephone interview. He estimated that 3,000 to 4,000 civilians were still in Bakhmut, including 60 children.', 'The Kremlin has focused on Bakhmut — which had a prewar population of about 70,000 and where several highways and rail lines converge — as pivotal to President Vladimir V. Putin’s stated goal of conquering Donbas, the vital industrial and mining region that makes up easternmost Ukraine.', 'Russia has poured enormous numbers of troops into trying to conquer it, driving conscripts into near-suicidal assaults in a bid to overwhelm Ukrainian defensive lines.', 'The city now lies in ruins, and the vast majority of its people have long fled, but Ukrainians have made Bakhmut a symbol of tenacious resistance and a rallying cry, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has rejected talk of giving it up. Ukrainian forces have also used Russia’s relentless wave of attacks as an opportunity to inflict thousands of casualties.', 'The result, military analysts say, has been slaughter out of proportion to the city’s strategic importance. U.S. officials estimate that Russia has seen nearly 200,000 fighters killed or wounded since it invaded almost a year ago, a staggering loss swelled by the battle for Bakhmut. But the Kremlin, undaunted, drafted about 300,000 men last fall and sent many of them to the Donbas.', 'In July, the industrial city of Lysychansk, on a rise overlooking the Siversky Donets River, fell to Russian control. It had held out for a week after Russia seized Sievierodonetsk, its twin city across the river.', 'As the Feb. 24 anniversary of the invasion approaches, Western analysts see the fight for Bakhmut and the surrounding area as a prelude to, or the early stages of, a broader new Russian offensive. Ukraine, hoping to fend off that assault and mount an offensive of its own, has been pleading with the West for more powerful and modern weapons, and faster delivery of arms.', 'The Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the U.S.-led coalition of some 50 countries providing military aid to Ukraine, will meet on Tuesday in Brussels. Among the items to be discussed — if unlikely to meet approval any time soon — is Kyiv’s call for fighter jets.', 'Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said the meeting would also address how to ramp up production of munitions like artillery shells, which Ukraine is using faster than Western manufacturers can make them.', '“It is clear that we are in a race of logistics,” Mr. Stoltenberg said on Monday. “Key capabilities like ammunition, fuel and spare parts must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the initiative on the battlefield. Speed will save lives.”', 'Ukrainian officials want to bring to bear promised Western tanks and long-range artillery, among other weapons, in time to affect the intense fighting for Bakhmut and Kreminna, a Russian-held town about 30 miles to the north, and to prevent the Russians from advancing on the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.', 'In an assessment of the battlefield on Monday, Rochan Consulting, an analytical group based in Poland, noted that Russia had encroached on Bakhmut from the north and the south in recent days, and said the city could fall as soon as this week.', 'As Russian radio broadcasts in the city predict its imminent fall, “many people sit in basements and are afraid to go out or let their children out” even to be evacuated, said Mr. Puryshev, the aid volunteer.', 'Speaking in a video address posted online, a Ukrainian commander who goes by the nickname Madyar said the ban on aid workers and groups entering Bakhmut was necessary because the fighting now “exposes to danger even volunteers who come here with good intentions to help.” The Ukrainian Army will now provide aid to those who need it, he said.', '“Bakhmut was, is and remains Ukrainian,” he said.', 'The decision suggests that the Ukrainian military cannot secure even areas in the city that for months had been considered relatively safe, such as neighborhoods on the western bank of the Bakhmutka River that are farther from Russian artillery.', 'Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Monday that its forces had taken the village of Krasna Hora, on the northern edge of Bakhmut. The statement, posted on the Telegram messaging app, came a day after the Wagner private military company, whose forces have helped lead Russia’s campaign to seize Bakhmut, said that its “assault units” had taken the village.', 'Bakhmut has been under Russian bombardment since last spring, but the fighting there has intensified since the fall, with the Russians firing thousands of artillery shells per day.', 'Wagner recruited mercenaries from among Russian inmates with the promise of pardons, using them on the front lines in Bakhmut, where they have suffered heavy casualties.', 'Moscow’s forces fought their way town by town, street by street, house by house toward the city, breaching multiple lines of defense. Now, they are sending small units that slip into the city, said Colonel Cherevaty, the Ukrainian military spokesman.']"

Help me, please!” the private said, though no help arrived. Eight soldiers were killed, one escaped back to Russian lines and Sergei was captured by Ukrainians.', 'The soldiers were sitting ducks, sent forth by Russian commanders to act essentially as human cannon fodder in an assault.', 'And they have become an integral component of Russia’s military strategy as it\xa0presses a new offensive in Ukraine’s east: relying on overwhelming manpower, much of it comprising inexperienced, poorly trained conscripts, regardless of the high rate of casualties.', 'There are two main uses of the conscripts in these assaults: as “storm troops” who move in waves, followed by more experienced Russian fighters; and as intentional targets, to draw fire and thus identify Ukrainian positions to hit with artillery.', 'In interviews last week, half a dozen prisoners of war provided rare firsthand accounts of what it is like to be part of\xa0a sacrificial Russian assault.', '“These orders were common, so our losses were gigantic,” Sergei said. “The next group would follow after a pause of 15 or 20 minutes, then another, then another.”', 'Of his combat experience, he said, “It was the first and last wave for me.”', 'By luck, the bullets missed him, he said. He lay in the dark until he was captured by Ukrainians who slipped into the buffer area between the two trench lines.', 'The New York Times interviewed the Russians at a detention center near Lviv in Ukraine’s west, where many captured enemy soldiers are sent. From there, some are returned to Russia in prisoner exchanges. The Times also viewed videos of interrogations by the Ukrainian authorities. The prisoners are identified only by first name and rank for security reasons, because of the possibility of retribution once they are returned.', 'Though they are prisoners of war overseen by Ukrainians, the Russians said they spoke freely. Their accounts could not be independently corroborated but conformed with assessments of the fighting around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut by Western governments and military analysts.', 'The soldiers in Sergei’s squad were recruited from penal colonies by the private military company known as Wagner, whose forces have mostly been deployed in the Bakhmut area. There, they have enabled Russian lines to move forward slowly, cutting key resupply roads for the Ukrainian Army.', 'Russia’s deployment of former convicts is a dark chapter in a vicious war. Russia Behind Bars, a prison rights group, has estimated that as many as 50,000 Russian prisoners have been recruited since last summer, with most sent to the battle for Bakhmut.', 'In the early phases of\xa0 the\xa0war, the Russian Army had copious armored vehicles, artillery and other heavy weaponry but relatively few soldiers on the battlefield. Now, the tables have turned: Russia has deployed about 320,000 soldiers in Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence agency. An additional 150,000 are in training camps, officials said, meaning there is the potential for half a million soldiers to join the offensive.', 'But using infantry to storm trenches, redolent of World War I, brings high casualties. So far, the tactic has been used primarily by Wagner in the push for Bakhmut. Last week, the head of Wagner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, said he would end the practice of recruiting convicts. But Russia’s regular army this month began recruiting convicts in exchange for pardons, shifting the practice on the Russian side in the war from the Wagner private army to the military.', 'Some military analysts and Western governments have questioned Russia’s strategy,\xa0 citing rates of wounded and killed at around 70 percent in battalions featuring former convicts. On Sunday, the British defense intelligence agency\xa0said\xa0that over the past two weeks, Russia had probably suffered its highest rate of casualties since the first week of the invasion.', 'Interviews with former Wagner soldiers at the Ukrainian detention center aligned with these descriptions of the fighting — and shed light on a violent, harrowing experience for Russian soldiers.', '“Nobody could ever believe such a thing could exist,”  Sergei said of Wagner tactics.', 'Sergei, sat, shoulders slumped, on the sofa in the warden’s office of the Ukrainian detention center. He was balding and wore shoes without laces.', 'The soldiers arrived at the front straight from Russia’s penal colony system, which is rife with abuse and where obedience to harsh codes of conduct in a violent setting is enforced by prison gangs and guards alike. The same sense of beaten subjugation persists at the front, Sergei said, enabling commanders to send soldiers forward on hopeless, human wave attacks.', '“We are prisoners, even if former prisoners,” he said. “We are nobody and have no rights.”', ' Sergei said he had worked as a cellphone\xa0tower technician in a far-northern Siberian city, living with his wife and three children. In the interview, he admitted to dealing marijuana and meth, for which he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2020.', 'In October, he accepted an offer to fight in exchange for a pardon. The arrangement, he said, was not offered to rapists and drug addicts, but murderers, burglars and other prisoners were welcome.', '“Of course, any normal person fears death,” he said. “But a pardon for eight years is valuable.”', 'The fighting would turn out to be far more dangerous than he had imagined.', 'In three days at the front south of Bakhmut, Private Sergei first served as a stretcher bearer, carrying out mangled, bloody former prisoners who had been killed or wounded in an omen of what awaited him when ordered to join an assault.', '\xa0On the night of Jan. 1, they were commanded to advance 500 yards along the tree line, then dig in and wait for a subsequent wave to arrive. One soldier carried a light machine gun. The others were armed with only assault rifles and hand grenades.', 'The sequential assaults on Ukrainian lines by small units of former Russian prisoners have become a signature Russian tactic in the effort to capture Bakhmut.', '“We see them crawl for a kilometer or more,” toward Ukrainian trenches, then open fire at close range and try to capture positions, Col. Roman Kostenko, the chairman of the defense and intelligence committee in Ukraine’s Parliament, said in an interview. “It’s effective. Yes, they have heavy losses. But with these heavy losses, they sometimes advance.”', 'It could be, Colonel Kostenko said, that such infantry assaults on entrenched defenses will remain mostly confined to the fight for Bakhmut and that they are being used to conserve tanks and armored personnel carriers for the expected offensive. But they could also serve as a template for wider fighting.', 'The former convicts, Colonel Kostenko said, are herded into the battlefield by harsh discipline: “They have orders, and they cannot disobey orders, especially in Wagner.”', 'A private named Aleksandr, 44, who shaved three years off a sentence for illegal logging by enlisting with Wagner, said that before deploying to the front he was told he would be shot if he disobeyed orders to advance.', '“They brought us to a basement, divided us into five-person groups and, though we hadn’t been trained, told us to run ahead, as far as we could go,” he said of his commanders.', 'His dash toward Ukrainian lines in a group of five soldiers ended with three dead and two captured.', 'Another captured Russian, Eduard, 22, enlisted to get four years cut from a sentence for car theft. He spent three months at the front as a stretcher bearer before being ordered forward. He was captured on his first human wave assault. From his time as a stretcher bearer, he said, he estimated that half of the men in each assault were wounded or killed, with shrapnel and bullet wounds the most common injuries.', 'Private Sergei said he had initially been pleased with the offer of a pardon in exchange for service in Wagner. “When I came to this war, I thought it was worth it,” he said.', 'But after his one experience in an assault, he changed his mind. “I started to think things over in a big way,’’ he said. “Of course it wasn’t worth it.”']"

He was set up at a Ukrainian firing position, and looked just like the other Ukrainian troops fighting south of the city of Bakhmut in one of the most brutal theaters of the war.', 'But he and his comrades are not Ukrainian. They are soldiers in a Ukrainian military unit made up entirely of Russians who are fighting and killing their own countrymen.', 'They have taken up arms against Russia for a variety of reasons: a sense of moral outrage at their country’s invasion, a desire to defend their adopted homeland of Ukraine or because of a visceral dislike of\xa0Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. And they have earned enough trust from Ukrainian commanders to take their place among the forces viciously fighting the Russian military.', '“A real Russian man doesn’t engage in such an aggressive war, won’t rape children, kill women and elderly people,” said one Russian fighter with the military call sign Caesar, ticking off atrocities committed by Russian soldiers that motivated him to leave his native St. Petersburg and fight for Ukraine. “That’s why I don’t have remorse. I do my job and I’ve killed a lot of them.”', 'Nearly a year into the war, the Free Russia Legion, as the unit is called, has received little attention — in part to protect the soldiers from reprisals by Russia, but also because of reluctance within the Ukrainian military to highlight the efforts of soldiers whose home country has done so much harm to Ukraine. Several hundred of them are concentrated in the area around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, officials said; they are always grouped with their own but are overseen by Ukrainian officers.', 'In interviews, some Russian soldiers said they were already living in Ukraine when Russian forces invaded last year, and felt an obligation to defend their adopted country. Others, often with no military experience, crossed into Ukraine from Russia after the war began, moved by a sense that the Kremlin’s invasion was profoundly unjust.', '“We haven’t come here to prove anything,” said one soldier with the call sign Zaza. “We’ve come here to help Ukraine achieve the full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and the future de-Putinization of Russia.”', 'Fearing retaliation against relatives and themselves, none of the soldiers interviewed agreed to be identified by name or to provide specific details about their biographies. Last week, the Russian prosecutor general’s office filed a suit with the country’s supreme court to have the Legion declared a terrorist organization.', 'Zaza, a skinny blond who looks barely out of high school, would not even give his age, saying only that he was under 20. After Russian forces invaded, he said, he could not keep his mouth shut. His outspokenness and antiwar posts on social media got him in trouble with his university’s administration, then with the police. When officers from Russia’s security service showed up at his front door in the fall, he said, he decided it was time to leave.', 'He said he walked across the border into Ukraine and signed up to fight.', '“At such a young age, it is a little early for me to talk about my political opinions and worldview, because these are just forming now,” he said. “But when your country has been taken over by one bad man, you need to take things into your own hands.”\xa0', 'At the start of the war, Ukrainian law prevented Russian citizens from joining the armed forces. It took until August to finalize legislation that would allow the Legion to legally join the fight, Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence service, said in a statement.', '“There was a large number of Russians who because of their moral principles could not remain indifferent and were searching for a way to enter the ranks of the defenders of Ukraine,” Mr. Yusov said, explaining the military’s motivation to create the unit. “All legionnaires have come with a huge desire to stop Putin’s horde and free Russia from dictatorship.”', 'The group operates under the umbrella of Ukraine’s International Legion, a fighting force that includes units made up of American and British volunteers, as well as Belarusians, Georgians and others.', 'It is not easy to join, Russian soldiers said. They have to submit an application and undergo an extensive background check that includes polygraph tests. Only then can they enter basic training. As Russian passport holders, they are inevitably met with distrust. There have been several attempts by Russian spies to infiltrate the Legion, Mr. Yusov said.', 'In a pine forest in the Kyiv region last week, a group of new Russian recruits nearing the end of a three-month basic training course practiced tactical retreats, firing mortars and basic combat medicine. They exemplified the international hodgepodge that has come to define much of Ukraine’s war effort: Russian soldiers trained on a French-made 155 millimeter mortar and carried American-made M16 rifles.', '“It’s better than a Kalashnikov,” one of the soldiers said of the M16. “I’ve fired about 1,000 rounds and haven’t had any problems yet.”', 'The sounds of small-arms fire and heavy artillery echoed through the forest, and an instructor threw a dummy grenade near a small group of soldiers to gauge how they would react. Most of the soldiers will occupy positions back from the front lines, working in artillery or air reconnaissance units using drones.', 'Though the instructors were all Ukrainian, all spoke in Russian. In interviews, some of the recruits tried to speak a few words of Ukrainian, but quickly switched back to their native language.', '“After about one or two months as they’ve settled in, they start to use small phrases like ‘thank you’ or ‘fire,’” said one of the instructors, who declined to provide his name.', 'The soldiers said they struggled to explain their decision to family back in Russia. Reports of atrocities committed by Russian troops, including the butchering of civilians in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha and Irpin, are dismissed as foreign propaganda in their homeland.', '“They don’t understand the whole truth,” said a 32-year-old soldier with the call sign Miami, who said his parents had urged him to fight on the Russian side. “They’re told that bad people live here, and they believe it. They don’t believe that the second biggest army in the world could kill regular people.”', 'Back at the front in eastern Ukraine, the shelling never stops for long.

Capturing the city would not guarantee that Russia could make major advances in the east, but it would better position its forces to do so.', 'The battle for the city has been one of the bloodiest of the war, billed as a “meat grinder” for the heavy casualties suffered on both sides. Russia’s efforts there were for some time largely spearheaded by fighters from the Wagner private military company, which has\xa0recruited prisoners\xa0into its ranks. Its founder, Yevgeny V.

Ukraine said in a statement that it had shot down 61 of the cruise missiles and five of the drones, but it does not have the capability to intercept the S-300.', '“Their targets were civilians, civilian infrastructure,” Mr. Zelensky, who was traveling back to Ukraine after a stop in Poland, said in a video statement. He added: “This is terror that can and must be stopped — stopped by the world.”', 'Ukrainian officials said that two of the Russian missiles, fired from ships in the Black Sea, had crossed the airspace of Romania, which is a NATO country, and Moldova, which is not, on their way to Ukraine. Romania rejected the claim that its airspace had been violated, which would have risked inflaming tensions between NATO and Moscow.', 'Russian missiles have crossed over Moldova, a small country sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, several times, despite Moldovan protests. The prime minister of Moldova on Friday announced her resignation in a reshuffle tied to problems she said were caused by the war, but her party remains in power.', 'Mr. Zelensky has argued repeatedly for NATO to see itself as being endangered by Russia, too, trying to goad the alliance into getting more involved in the fight. In November, he maintained that an explosion just across the border in Poland that killed two people was caused by a Russian missile, even after Polish and NATO officials said it was actually a remnant of a Ukrainian air defense missile.', 'This week, Mr. Zelensky made a whirlwind European tour — only his second trip outside the country since the war began — to rally support among Ukraine’s allies and plead for heavier weapons. He traveled to Britain, France, Belgium and Poland, met with heads of state and addressed the British and European parliaments.', 'His lobbying has already contributed to Western pledges of a host of sophisticated weapons systems, including long-range rocket artillery, tanks and antiaircraft missiles. Britain is also considering supplying fighter jets.', 'President Biden will travel on Feb. 20 to Poland, the White House announced on Friday, for meetings with Eastern European leaders who have been among the most vehement supporters of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 last year.', 'Since October, Russia has launched more than a dozen major waves of strikes on Ukraine’s energy facilities, as well as many smaller attacks, attempting to overwhelm air defenses that have become more adept at fending off attacks. Frustrated on the battlefield, Russian forces have turned to trying to incapacitate Ukraine and leave civilians without power, heat and even water during the winter.', 'The full extent of the damage from Friday’s strikes was not immediately clear, but energy infrastructure was hit in six regions of the country, according to Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko.', '“Emergency shutdowns have been introduced in many regions,” Mr. Galushchenko said in a statement, adding that energy workers were working to restore supply. The state-owned power utility, Ukrenergo, confirmed damage to several high-voltage infrastructure sites in the eastern, western and southern regions of Ukraine.', 'The S-300 missiles were fired from Belgorod in Russia and the occupied city of Tokmak in southern Ukraine, toward targets in the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, officials said.', 'Anatolii Kurtiev, the secretary of the Zaporizhzhia City Council, said that at least 17 missile strikes had been reported there in less than an hour — the most intense bombardment since the war began. In Kharkiv, in the northeast, at east 10 explosions were reported overnight, said Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the regional administration. In both cities, officials said the scale of the damage was not immediately clear.', 'As air raid alarms sounded and civilians ran for shelter on Friday, Ukraine’s air defense units fanned out to open spaces with unobstructed fields of fire around major cities, in what is now a well-rehearsed series of steps, while radar stations swept the skies.', '“As soon as my station registers something, we see it in the system” on a computer map, said Captain Andriy, a radar operator, who, like other members of his team, asked to be identified only by first name and rank.', 'Ukraine operates new Western-provided air defense weapons, including German-made IRIS-T and American-Norwegian NASAMS missiles, as well as older, Soviet-designed antiaircraft systems. But it also relies on mobile groups in trucks mounted with machine guns, which can be effective against relatively slow-moving drones. Soldiers with shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles can sometimes shoot down cruise missiles at low altitude.', '“This morning three ballistic missiles flew by us, but they were too far to shoot down,” said Captain Andriy. He operates the radar for his air-defense group and uses a tablet computer showing missiles in flight throughout Ukraine, including those that might pass his machine gunners.', 'A private, who gave only his first name, Oleksandr, spent hours on Friday at the ready with a shoulder-fired missile. He did not have a chance to use it, but “we are learning,” he said. “We shoot down more these days.”', 'Over Kyiv, the capital, Ukrainian fighter jets raced across the sky to intercept inbound missiles, and air defense systems thundered. Ten missiles were shot down over the city, though power transmission lines were damaged, according to the mayor, Vitali Klitschko. He said engineers were working to restore the lines.', 'On the ground, Ukrainian forces on Friday battled advancing Russians in the pine forests near Kreminna, and held onto increasingly precarious defensive positions in the frozen trenches and battered buildings around the ruined city of Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian officials and military analysts.', 'The pace of Russian operations continued to intensify, but Britain’s defense intelligence agency said that Kyiv was managing to broadly hold its defensive lines.', '“It is quite difficult for our fighters, but they control the situation” in Kreminna, Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said in a statement on Friday about Ukraine’s efforts to repel the Russian assault.', 'After drafting some 300,000 men last fall, Russia now has about 150,000 troops in Ukraine, analysts say, and could send in still more, but many of them are raw conscripts with little training or motivation. U.S. officials estimate that as many as 200,000 Russian fighters have been killed or wounded in the past year — more than the number the Kremlin initially assigned to the invasion force.', 'Since Russia launched its invasion, its forces have rarely made swift gains; instead its advances have played out over weeks and months of grueling combat. They have fought for several months to take Bakhmut, which Moscow sees as a jumping-off point for attacking the Ukrainian stronghold at Kramatorsk, a vital step toward seizing all of the Donbas, which Russia has illegally annexed, despite not fully controlling the region. In addition, Kreminna and Bakhmut both sit along important highways.', 'Russia continued to make slow progress in its effort to cut off Ukrainian troops defending Bakhmut, Britain’s defense intelligence agency said on Friday.', 'Last summer, Ukraine abandoned the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the face of a grinding Russian onslaught, rather than risk encirclement of its forces. But Mr. Zelensky said recently that there would be no such retreat from Bakhmut.']"

Analysts and rights activists said the videos were an effort to raise Wagner’s flagging recruitment numbers. (Mr. Prigozhin said on Thursday that Wagner would no longer recruit fighters in Russian prisons, though he did not specify why.)', 'The pardon videos immediately raised questions about whether the recruiting was circumventing the legal process. Existing pardon rules typically required an extended consultation process among multiple government agencies. And only Mr. Putin, as president, can pardon prisoners. In 2021, he pardoned just six people, according to the Kremlin.', 'The prison release certificate reviewed by The Times was issued by Russia’s Justice Ministry. It says that the inmate was freed in late August by “a pardon decree issued by the president of the Russian Federation.”', 'The former prisoner received the certificate this month while recuperating from a mine injury in an infirmary in southern Russia. The Times redacted his personal details to protect him against retaliation.', 'The Times obtained the certificate from Yana Gelmel, a Russian prisoner’s rights lawyer. The inmate’s mother had previously confirmed to The Times his identity and Wagner contract. His personal details and prison sentences also match those found in Russia’s publicly available legal database.', 'Ms. Gelmel said the issuing of such certificates dealt a major blow to the vestiges of legality in Russia by erasing the rights of crime victims to compensation.', '“They can kill a man, they can rob, and then they can go to war and walk free,” she said of former inmates who had received pardons. “This is complete impunity.”', 'The Kremlin has not published any pardon decrees this year, but Mr. Putin’s spokesman and pro-government rights campaigners have implied in recent weeks that Wagner fighters’ legal statuses could be a state secret.', '“All these decrees are closed,” Eva Merkacheva, a member of Russia’s Kremlin-allied Human Rights Council, told the state news media in January. “We can’t see them.”']"

She sleeps on a cot in a hallway. She makes $375 a month, and her city in southern Ukraine has become one of the war’s most pummeled places, fired on by Russian artillery nearly every hour.', 'But Ms. Luhova, the only female mayor of a major city in Ukraine, remains determined to project a sense of normality even though Kherson is anything but normal.

She circulates in neighborhoods and chit-chats with residents — whose lives have been torn apart by explosions.', 'She chalks up any complaints about corruption or mismanagement — and there are plenty — to rumor-mongering by Russian-backed collaborators who are paid to frustrate her administration.', 'Kherson, a port city on the Dnipro River, was captured by Russian forces in March; liberated by Ukrainian forces in November; and now, three months later, lies nearly deserted. Packs of out-of-school children roam the empty boulevards lined with leafless trees and centuries-old buildings cracked in half.', 'Ms. Luhova sees her job defined by basic verbs: bury, clean, fix and feed. Of the 10 percent or so of Kherson’s original population of 330,000 who remain, many are too old, too poor, too stubborn or too strung out to flee.', 'She recently became so overwhelmed with their needs — for food, water, generators, internet access, buses, pensions, medicine, firewood — that she said she dropped to 40 minutes of sleep a night and became so exhausted, she had to be put on intravenous drugs. She feels better, she said, though not exactly calm.', '“We need those bomb shelters, now,” she snapped at a meeting in early February, when it was several degrees below freezing outside.', 'In front of her, in an underground office, sat the heads of the city’s main departments, many in winter jackets and hats.

Before the Russian invasion last February, she was the council’s secretary, considered the No. 2 official.', 'Russian forces burned down her house in March, and she left the city shortly after. The Russians tried to make Kherson part of Russia, forcing children to learn Russian in schools and people to use Russian rubles in the markets. In June, they kidnapped her boss, Kherson’s prior mayor, and he hasn’t been seen since. Ms. Luhova took his place and became the head of Kherson’s military administration.', 'When she returned in November, she found a city ecstatic that the Russians had been driven out but in terrible shape.

In the past two and half months, Ukrainian officials said, it has been hit more than 1,800 times.', 'The shells come with no warning. There are no air raid sirens. These are projectiles fired from tanks, artillery guns, mortars and rocket launchers that blow up a few seconds later — the Russians are that close, 700 meters in some places. Residents have almost no time to take cover.', 'The other afternoon, a rocket attack killed two men walking down a sidewalk. There was no military installation nearby.', '“Russia’s precise rationale for expending its strained ammunition stocks here is unclear,” said a recent British Defense Intelligence update on Kherson.', 'Since mid-November, Ukrainian officials say the Russians have wounded hundreds of residents and killed more than 75.', '“It’s just revenge,” Ms. Luhova said. “There’s an old saying: “If I can’t have it, nobody can,’’’ she said, trying to explain why the Russians would shell the city after retreating. “It’s that stupid but it’s true.”', 'Kherson may be a war-torn city on the front line of Europe’s deadliest conflict in generations, and Ms. Luhova may represent Ukraine’s never-give-up spirit that keeps a Russian flag from flying over this country.', 'But as in any other city, residents love complaining about their mayor.', '“I’ve called more than a hundred times to have my electricity fixed and nobody comes,” said Olena Yermolenko, a retiree who helped run a cell of citizen spies during the Russian occupation.

Instead, he appealed for financial aid to run and rebuild his country, and political support to give it hope.', 'He renewed his push for Ukraine’s quick accession to the European Union, though joining the bloc normally takes aspiring members more than a decade of work.

All told, it is a confident, if plaintive tour, by a leader whose country remains under lethal daily bombardment by Russian artillery.', 'Mr. Macron echoed Mr. Sunak’s pledge of support, though with no reference to planes. “It will be necessary for us to pursue, to adapt and to modulate the military support that is necessary to preserve Ukraine and its future,” he said.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s goal of securing fighter jets still faces formidable hurdles, but that didn’t stop him from making a full-throated entreaty.', '“I appeal to you and the world with these most simple and yet important words,” Mr. Zelensky said to a joint session of Parliament under the ancient, timbered ceiling of Westminster Hall. “Combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.”', 'Mr. Zelensky received a hero’s welcome in London on a day laden with symbolism. At the airport, he was welcomed with a hug by Mr. Sunak, who then conferred with him at 10 Downing Street. After his address to Parliament, Mr. Zelensky had an audience with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, before flying with Mr. Sunak to the base in Dorset, in southern England, to meet Ukrainian troops undergoing training.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s decision to make London the first stop of his trip, only his second outside Ukraine since Russia invaded last year, attested to Britain’s role as one of the largest suppliers of weapons to Ukraine, and to the steadfast public support of Mr. Sunak and his predecessors, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson.', 'Still, training pilots to fly high-tech planes is more time-consuming and difficult than training soldiers to drive tanks. Britain’s likeliest jet for export to Ukraine, the Eurofighter Typhoon, is complicated to operate and maintain, military analysts said.', 'It’s also not clear that Britain has enough planes to make a difference; there are only about 30 of the older generation of the Typhoon jets that could be made available, according to Janes, a defense intelligence firm.', 'Even the role of manned aircraft in this war has been constrained, given the widespread use of missiles and drones, and the effectiveness of Ukraine’s and Russia’s air-defense systems. For all their symbolic value, analysts said fighter jets might make less of a difference on the battlefield than tanks.', '“At some point, you need to ask what Ukraine is going to use them for,” said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “You don’t want highly sophisticated planes sitting on Ukrainian runways, where they can be targeted by the Russians.”', 'By signaling its openness to sending fighter planes, however, Britain could play the same catalyzing role it did in the debate over supplying tanks. Britain’s decision last month to send Ukraine 14 Challenger 2 battle tanks, as well as artillery and ammunition, helped prod a reluctant Germany and the United States to send battle tanks of their own.', 'Mr. Zelensky, whose visit was announced by Downing Street barely two hours before his Royal Air Force plane landed, arrived in London with a full agenda. He wanted to thank British leaders, past and present, for being among the first to ship weapons. And then he wanted to present his shopping list.', '“London has stood with Kyiv from Day 1,” Mr. Zelensky said to thunderous applause from lawmakers standing in Westminster Hall. “I will be leaving today thanking you for powerful English planes,” he added to scattered laughter.', 'In a dramatic gesture that doubled as a sales pitch, Mr. Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, with the helmet that the president said belonged to one of the ace fighter pilots in Ukraine’s air force. A message was scrawled on it: “We have freedom; give us wings to protect it.”', 'While there are significant qualms inside the British government about sending combat jets, there are also important reservoirs of support. Mr. Johnson, who visited Kyiv several times and cultivated a friendship with Mr. Zelensky, renewed his call for Britain and other Western allies to grant Ukraine’s request.', '“Your powerful and passionate appeal must be heard,” Mr. Johnson wrote on Twitter after attending Mr. Zelensky’s speech. “There is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by sending planes now.”', 'Mr. Zelensky returned the warmth. During the speech, he singled out Mr. Johnson, saying, “Boris, you got others to act.”', 'At several key moments before and during the nearly yearlong war, Britain has thrust itself into the vanguard of Western military support for Ukraine. Early in the conflict, Mr. Zelensky said, shipments of British antitank missiles enabled Ukrainian troops to halt the advance of the Russian Army.', 'Britain has trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops, including soldiers who arrived last week to learn how to operate the Challenger tanks. In addition to pilots, Britain said it would begin to train Ukrainian marines.', 'In his news conference with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Sunak said their talks focused on more short-term combat needs like tanks and long-range missiles. He took credit for Britain’s decision to provide tanks, saying it had goaded others to act.', 'The two leaders are an odd pair: Mr. Zelensky is a charismatic former actor and comedian, Mr. Sunak a button-down former investment banker. But Mr. Sunak has maintained the staunch support for Ukraine that began under Mr. Johnson.', 'Britain’s hawkish response reflects both its vexed history with Russia, which it blamed for poisoning a Russian agent on British soil, as well as a self-conscious effort by Mr. Johnson to drape himself in the mantle of his hero, Winston Churchill.', 'But the war has also forced Britain to confront its cozy, sometimes corrupt, ties with Russian oligarchs, many of whom have used London to shelter and launder their assets. Britain has blacklisted dozens of oligarchs, though critics say it has not done nearly enough.', 'On Wednesday, the British government announced a raft of new sanctions targeting the Russian military and loyalists of President Vladimir V. Putin, with the aim of “undermining his war machine to help Ukraine prevail,” the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said in a statement.', 'The list includes several companies that support Russian military operations, including CST, a drone manufacturer, as well as businesses that supply military parts and software involved in military aviation. Five individuals were also targeted for their apparent ties to Mr. Putin’s residences.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s emotional address followed the weekly ritual of Prime Minister’s Questions, a normally rough-and-tumble session in which Mr. Sunak and the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, go toe to toe. Rather than a partisan cage match, however, this session was mostly a display of unity in support of Ukraine.', 'Demonstrating that bipartisanship, Mr. Starmer encouraged the government to continue its military support, called for Mr. Putin to be prosecuted for war crimes in The Hague and proposed that the British government use frozen Russian assets as funds to reconstruct Ukraine after the war.', 'In speaking in Westminster Hall, Mr. Zelensky joined an extremely select group of foreign dignitaries, including President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela, the former South African leader.', 'The hall, in the shadow of Big Ben, is one of the most hallowed places in British public life. Erected by King William II in 1097, it is where King Richard I had his coronation banquet in 1189 and Thomas More was tried for treason in 1535. It was last used for the lying-in-state of Queen Elizabeth II after her death in September.']"

The vehicle’s arrival is a big event.', 'For eight months, the village of Levkivka in eastern Ukraine was under occupation by Russian troops, who cut off roughly 300 residents from the outside world. There was no running water or power, and Russian soldiers would often snatch their cellphones and stomp on them, fearful that locals would betray their locations, residents said. The only medical care was provided by two village nurses, who braved the constant shelling to make house calls with limited supplies and medicine.', 'Though Ukrainian forces recaptured Levkivka in September, reconnecting the village to basic services has come slowly. Power and water are back, but medical care is still hard to come by. The medical truck, provided by the United Nations Population Fund and staffed with doctors from the city of Kharkiv, 75 miles to the north, travels around the region, part of a continuing Ukrainian government effort to bring a semblance of normalcy to once occupied villages in the east.', 'With Russian troops dug in just 50 miles away and the occasional rumble of artillery in the distance, there is a palpable sense of urgency. Ukraine’s military may have cleared the immediate area of Russian forces, but fully controlling territory means more than planting a flag. And in the villages of eastern Ukraine, where many locals speak a blend of Ukrainian and Russian called surzhik, loyalty to Kyiv is not guaranteed.', 'Viktor Putyetin, 62, who came to the mobile clinic for a checkup, said in a whisper that there was significant support for the Russian troops in Levkivka, though he strongly opposed the Kremlin’s designs on Ukraine. He said that under occupation he approached a 22-year-old Russian soldier operating an air-defense battery, who was wearing an arm patch with the Soviet hammer and sickle.', '“I asked him, ‘Sonny, have you ever seen the Soviet Union?’” Mr. Putyetin said. “‘In the Soviet Union, you had to wipe your butt with newspaper because there was no toilet paper. Ask your dad about that.’”', 'While the war is not far from people’s minds, most in the village are preoccupied with more quotidian concerns like renewing drug prescriptions and dealing with their hypertension and diabetes. Many who arrived for medical checkups were women: either\xa0older adults\xa0or young mothers with babies.', 'Halina Romashenko, 26, gave birth to a son, Sasha, just as Ukrainian forces were pushing Russian troops out of the area. For seven months, she received no prenatal care and said she had to hide in her potato cellar as rockets crashed into the fields around her home. She said her family had no money to move and nowhere else to go.', '“So we had to stay here,” Ms. Romashenko said.', 'Valentina Kalashnikova, 66, her grandmother, accompanied her to the clinic, putting on sparkly pink lipstick for the occasion. The stress of the occupation had aggravated her high blood pressure. A shell destroyed her kitchen, and two of her cows were killed. She made an effort to smile brightly, but at times she could not keep the tears at bay.', '“I’m scared, of course, mostly for them,” she said, pointing to her grandchild and great-grandchild. “I’m a war granny.”', 'Levkivka, a village of tidy homes along the Siversky Donets River, is in a region mangled by vicious fighting. The carcasses of tanks and armored vehicles, their metal hides perforated by rockets, litter the rolling farm fields. Whole villages have been simply wiped out, with piles of brick and charred wood where houses once stood.', 'Russian troops did not subject residents of Levkivka to the kinds of horrors endured in places like the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha or Irpin, where hundreds of civilians were killed. But their presence was still traumatic, locals said. Tatyana Budyanska, one of the two nurses in town, said she was on her way to a house call, her 3-year-old grandson in tow, when Russian troops stopped her and accused her of passing information to Ukrainian forces. They put an automatic rifle to the boy’s head, she said, but ultimately let them go.', 'Compared with many neighboring villages, Levkivka appears relatively unscathed, a bit of good fortune that locals attribute to the Russian military’s decision to retreat before the arrival of Ukrainian troops. One morning, residents woke up and the\xa0Russian forces were just gone.', 'This has made Levkivka a refuge for people whose homes fared far worse. Halina Cherednichenko, who is almost 80 and walks with a pronounced hunch, recalled rushing for water when her daughter’s house caught fire in an attack on her nearby village. She now lives in Levkivka, where volunteers provide her with groceries as well as with seeds for a small garden. At the medical center, she said, she gets free pills.', '“I’m an old granny,” she said. “A lot of people like me died a long time ago, but I’m still moving.”', 'Alina Okunyeva, an ultrasound specialist with the mobile medical unit, said she had made an expansive survey of the villages once under occupation in Ukraine’s northeast. Some villages still do not have power or water she said, and telephone communications are spotty. Residents are isolated and suffering from the effects of stress. Hypertension is a major problem, she said, but, in general, people have held up well.', '“I thought things would be much worse,” said Ms. Okunyeva, 27. “They’ll never beat our people.”', 'For many, it is still difficult to suppress fears that the war will return to their village. Fighting has intensified nearby, and it appears as though Russian forces are preparing for a new offensive aimed at taking back some of the territory recaptured last year. Mines scattered in the farm fields periodically explode, straining the nerves.', '“We’re alive, but still, we live in fear,” said Nina Kachenko, 72. “The war is still not over.”', 'While the mothers received checkups for their infants in the medical truck, a cardiologist with the group took over an office in the town’s clinic nearby, seeing mostly older patients.

Putin, just as Ukrainians once expelled their Kremlin-backed president in a popular uprising in 2014.', 'Halina Kapran, 66, who was dressed in a gray fur hat, said she believed that support for Mr. Putin was low among Russians and that one day they would liberate themselves. Mr. Putyetin dismissed the notion, arguing that propaganda had turned Russians into obedient farm animals.', '“Halina, if I told you every day that you were a cow, you’d believe it,” he said.', 'Inside the medical office, the doctor was busy checking electrocardiograms and blood pressure. He also was dispensing prescriptions for anti-anxiety medicine.']"

Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America’s “pacing” challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.', 'On Tuesday night Mr. Biden faced a changed world.', 'Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.', 'So it was especially striking that in the president’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America’s global role, focusing instead on his “Made in America” effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America’s closest allies and top trade partners.', 'History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Mr. Biden’s most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.', 'But it made all the more vivid Mr. Biden’s choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America’s re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.', 'Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Mr. Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.', 'Since the summer, Mr. Biden’s intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks — threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.', 'Now, Mr. Biden’s national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the Covid-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.', 'As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken postponed his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Mr. Biden was “weak” for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a “clear overreaction” and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.', 'These are the issues that dominate Mr. Biden’s days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.', 'And yet Mr. Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly on Tuesday night — far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.', 'Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $52 billion to jump-start chip production. “We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” he said.', 'To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.', '“The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses,” Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” said to the Marketplace radio program.', 'Mr. Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the balloon.', 'The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”', 'Mr. Biden also tried to make the case on Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country — to show that “democracy works” and can outpace autocracies — he has begun to show progress. “In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,’’ he said. “Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.”', 'It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. “Before I came to office the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world,” he said. “Not anymore.” He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Mr. Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.', 'That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Mr. Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia’s aggression. “Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf war has a president pulled together this kind of alliance,” said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. “It has required a retooling of American foreign policy.”', 'After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Mr. Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Mr. Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.', 'But as George H.W. Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Mr. Biden’s advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs influences voters in ways that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.']"

Still it remains far from clear that Moscow can mobilize enough forces to sustain a prolonged offensive.', 'The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that Russian forces were attacking in five different directions along the crescent-shaped front line in the east, relying on masses of troops to try to overrun Ukrainian positions. The tactic has allowed Russia to make incremental gains in recent weeks and, according to U.S. officials, to slowly tighten a noose around the key Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut. But the strategy has come at a cost of hundreds of dead and wounded soldiers each day.', '“The major threat is the quantity,” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the eastern region of Luhansk, told Ukrainian television on Tuesday. “It is a huge monster that is at war with us, and it owns immense resources — not endless, but still. There are too many of them.”', 'Mr. Haida had said earlier that a “full-scale offensive” could begin after Feb. 15, as the Kremlin strains to show progress around the one-year mark of its invasion.', 'Amid reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine would visit Brussels on Thursday to meet with European Union leaders for a long-planned summit, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency repeated a warning that Moscow planned to mobilize as many as half a million more soldiers to sustain its campaign. That would be “in addition to the 300,000 mobilized in October 2022,” Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy intelligence chief, wrote in a lengthy statement released Monday night assessing the state of the war.', 'But Western intelligence officials have questioned whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could quickly find hundreds of thousands more soldiers without triggering a greater domestic backlash. The Kremlin is already struggling to train and arm the soldiers it does have, military analysts have said.', 'Britain’s defense intelligence agency said on Tuesday that Russia had been trying to launch “major offensive operations” since early last month, with the aim of capturing the rest of the Donetsk region, which includes Bakhmut. But it had “only managed to gain several hundred meters of territory per week,” in part because of a lack of munitions, the agency said in its latest daily assessment of the war.', 'But that hasn’t stopped Ukraine from sounding the alarm about a massive Russian buildup to come, as it agitates for more powerful weapons from the West. It first predicted that Russia would mobilize 500,000 new soldiers in January, a move that has not materialized.', 'As they have in the past, Ukrainian forces could answer a Russian offensive with a counteroffensive, but some military analysts have suggested that Ukraine would do better taking a strong defensive position that ultimately weakens Russia’s forces.', '“Arguably, UA is better served absorbing the RU attack & exhausting RU offensive potential, then taking the initiative later this spring,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va., wrote on Monday in an extended analytical thread on Twitter, referring to Ukraine and Russia.', 'The Kremlin continued to insist it was making progress in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told reporters that combat operations near Bakhmut and the town of Vuhledar, to the south, “are developing successfully,” the official Tass news agency reported.', 'While Moscow’s willingness to sacrifice large numbers of soldiers for only marginal gains has been demonstrated time and again over the course of the war, Mr. Putin has been reticent to publicly announce a second wave of mobilization. The announcement of a partial mobilization in Russia last September led hundreds of thousands of fighting-age men to flee the country.', 'Moscow’s latest push along the eastern front has relied upon inexperienced new recruits and former convicts to rush toward Ukrainian positions, straining Kyiv’s forces but also producing heavy casualties. A Russian opposition publication, Mediazona, has said that fewer Russian prisoners are willing to sign up for combat because of reports of high casualties among penal colony recruits.', 'Mr. Haidai said on Tuesday that Ukrainian officials had observed Russian commanders keeping newly arriving units of freshly mobilized soldiers separated from each other. The reason, he said, was to keep word of losses in the Russian ranks from spreading.', '“They have a huge number of dead and wounded, and the commanders are trying to prevent panic among fighters in this way,” Mr. Haidai said.', 'Ukraine’s Western allies have been rushing to provide tanks, armored vehicles and long-range weapons to bolster Kyiv’s defenses. On Tuesday, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands announced a plan to send around 100 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine, some of which could arrive “within a few months” — a far shorter timeline than the more advanced tanks Ukraine’s Western allies have pledged.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s visit to Brussels on Thursday, if it happens, would likely be aimed at shoring up political support as the European Union deals with the economic fallout of the war and the cost of hosting more than four million Ukrainian refugees. It would follow a visit by top E.U. leaders to Kyiv last week.', 'As part of a visit to Brussels, Mr. Zelensky would likely address the European Parliament on Thursday, according to an email from the Parliament’s secretary general to European lawmakers that was reviewed by The New York Times.

In December, Mr. Zelensky visited Washington to meet with President Biden and deliver an emotional plea to Congress.', 'Last month, Ukraine received more heavy military aid from the United States, as well as the promise of Abrams tanks.', 'European nations have largely closed ranks behind Ukraine, in some cases at great cost to their economies, including by severing their energy links to Russia. They have also dealt with the fallout of ratcheting up the economic costs of the war for the Kremlin through sanctions — while Mr. Zelensky has been pushing for more, and better enforced, economic penalties for Moscow.', 'Ukraine was granted E.U. candidate status in June, but the recent visit by European leaders to Kyiv underscored that the country was unlikely to be admitted to the club soon.

And they are coming more frequently, as Russian troops grind their way forward.', '“You should see the fireworks here,” said Ms. Degtyaryova, 61, as the sounds of artillery howled all around. “It is like New Year’s.”', 'Russia’s military is preparing to launch a new offensive that could soon swallow Ms. Degtyaryova’s village of Nevske, and perhaps much more in the eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas. But already the impact of Russia’s stepped-up assault is being felt in the towns and villages along the hundreds of miles of undulating eastern front.', 'Exhausted Ukrainian troops complain they are already outnumbered and outgunned, even before Russia has committed the bulk of its roughly 200,000 newly mobilized soldiers. And doctors at hospitals speak of mounting losses as they struggle to care for fighters with gruesome injuries.', 'The civilians standing in the way of Russia’s planned advance once again face the agonizing decision of whether to leave or to stay and wait out the coming calamity. This area in the northern Donbas was among the last to be liberated in a Ukrainian blitz offensive last fall that raised hopes among local residents that their months of trauma were over.', 'But the war has come back. Two weeks ago, a Russian shell landed in Ms. Degtyaryova’s yard, and as she contemplated her future over the weekend, the remains of her barn still smoldered.', 'She has rabbits, ducks and three pregnant cows to care for. A chicken, its feathers partly burned off in the recent strike, lay recovering in a bed of hay, its small injured foot in a homemade cast.', 'If the Russians come back, she lamented, she’ll have to flee.', '“I’ve started to pack my things, if I’m being honest,” she said. “The soldiers will cover my back and I will leave. I’ll let my cows out and I’ll go. I don’t want to go back there.”', 'When and where the new offensive will begin in earnest is still unclear, but Ukrainian officials are gravely concerned. Ukraine’s military defied dire assessments before the war, thwarting Russia’s early efforts to seize the capital, Kyiv, and eventually driving Russian forces back in the northeast and south.', 'But the Russian military just keeps coming. Right now, the newly mobilized troops are finishing their training and entering the field; the forces include as many soldiers as took part in the initial invasion last year.', 'They could be ready to fight in as little as two weeks, said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk Region, which includes Nevske — much sooner than new Western weapons, including tanks and heavy armored fighting vehicles, are expected to arrive in Ukraine.', '“There are so many,” Mr. Haidai said of the new recruits. “These are not professional soldiers, but it is still 200,000 people who are shooting in our direction.”', 'Russia is expected to punch hard, looking to reverse nearly a year of cascading failure. While a renewed attack on Kyiv is now considered improbable, Russian forces will likely try to recover territories they lost last fall, as well as take full control of the Donbas, a key objective of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.', 'Military analysts say that one likely scenario would be for Russian forces to swing down from the north and up from the south in an arc, creating a large claw that would cut off Ukrainian supply lines running east and west. That would put villages like Nevske in the direct path of Russia’s likely advance.', 'For locals it would be a disaster. Out here at the far edge of Ukraine’s offensive, people have not experienced the fruits of liberation the way Ukrainians farther west have. There is still no power or water and the fighting has never subsided. Fields of black unharvested sunflowers are pocked with snow-filled craters, and the area is littered with burned out tanks and unexploded ordnance and mines that frequently kill livestock. Passing through the region, one occasionally comes across their frozen bodies or bones.', 'In Makiivka, just north of Nevske, five of Ruslan Vasilchenko’s cows have been killed, and those that remain were huddled on a recent day in a tiny barn that had been spackled with shrapnel. There was a burned tank in his garden and two destroyed cars in his courtyard. He said he expected things would get much worse soon.', '“Over the last few days, the soldiers have come by to tell us not to leave our homes,” he said.', 'The first stages of the Russian offensive have already begun. Ukrainian troops say that Bakhmut, an eastern Ukrainian city that Russian forces have been trying to seize since the summer, is likely to fall soon. Elsewhere, Russian forces are advancing in small groups and probing the front lines looking for Ukrainian weaknesses.', 'The efforts are already straining Ukraine’s military, which is worn out by nearly 12 months of heavy fighting.', 'Troops say they have tanks and artillery pieces, but not enough of either, and have far less ammunition than their adversaries. Russian forces have also started to field more sophisticated weaponry, like the T-90 tank, which is equipped with technology capable of detecting the targeting systems of anti-tank weapons like the American-made Javelins, limiting their effectiveness.', 'Mostly, though, the challenge comes down to numbers.', '“It’s particularly difficult when you have 50 guys and they have 300,” said a 35-year-old infantry soldier named Pavlo, who was struck in the eye with a piece of shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade near Bakhmut. “You take them out and they keep coming and coming. There are so many.”', 'Losses among Ukrainian forces have been severe. Troops in a volunteer contingent called the Carpathian Sich, positioned near Nevske, said that some 30 fighters from their group had died in recent weeks, and soldiers said, only partly in jest, that just about everyone has a concussion.', '“It’s winter and the positions are open; there’s nowhere to hide,” said a soldier from the unit with the call sign Rusin.', 'At one frontline hospital in the Donbas, the morgue was packed with the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers in white plastic bags. In another hospital, stretchers with wounded troops covered in gold foil thermal blankets crowded the corridors, and a steady stream of ambulances arrived from the front nearly all day long.', 'A military surgeon at that hospital, Myroslav Dubenko, 36, scrolled through photographs of soldiers with ghastly injuries: a lower jaw blasted off, half of a face missing. One soldier was rushed in with his throat sliced open from ear to ear. Dr. Dubenko was able to quickly repair the damage, and the soldier survived.', '“In civilian life, you know that no matter how horrible your shift is, it will end sooner or later,” Dr. Dubenko said. “Here, you never know when it will end.”', 'It’s not just the influx of soldiers that is consuming doctors; civilians, too, are frequent victims of Russian attacks. For Andriy Drobnytsky, a 27-year-old military doctor, this is part of a deliberate strategy of overwhelming Ukraine’s military hospitals. Last week, a retired prison guard was rushed into the military hospital where Dr. Drobnytsky is deployed, his hand blown apart by a mortar shell that exploded while he was gathering firewood. Dr. Drobnytsky assisted in sewing his hand back together, probably saving his index finger.', '“If there are lots of victims, we’ll get distracted by them,” he said. “You just can’t abandon them, right?”', 'Whether Russia will be able to capitalize on its strength in numbers is an open question. Russian soldiers, according to Ukrainian and Western assessments, are dying in far greater numbers. American officials now estimate the number of Russian troops wounded and killed to be approaching 200,000, an astounding casualty rate.', 'In his sleeping quarters at a base near Bakhmut, a soldier with the call sign Badger pulled out a cloth bag and dumped its contents onto a cot. Inside were half a dozen knives — one with a hilt made from a deer’s hoof — trophies he said he had taken from the bodies of dead Russian soldiers.', '“We also have losses, but they have huge losses,” Badger said. “We’ve wasted them all in huge numbers.”', 'Back near Nevske, soldiers from the Carpathian Sich said they had enough ammunition to hang on for now. One soldier, with the call sign Diesel, showed videos on his phone of the bodies of Russian troops he had killed when they came too close.', 'As they have since the beginning of the war, the Russians continue to make stupid mistakes, he said. From one dead officer, Diesel said, he took a tablet computer without an access code that had the coordinates of all of their mines and snipers.', 'In a video he recorded from the front, Diesel approaches a body lying in the snow, his rifle muzzle trained on the Russian’s head.', '“Hello,” he whispers after determining the man was dead. “Did you sleep well?”']"

', 'These activities have included deals with penalized Russian companies, trade with Russia in U.S.-made products and the export to Russia of so-called dual-use goods, like plastics, rubber and electronics that can be used both for civilian and military purposes, the senior official said.', 'The Treasury Department said last week that sanctions on companies involved in such activities could block them from doing business in some of the world’s wealthiest countries, possibly undermining their profits.', 'In Turkey, Mr. Nelson, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, met with officials from the central bank and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs, as well as with representatives of Turkish banks, said Morgan Finkelstein, a Treasury Department spokeswoman.', 'Since the Ukraine war began last February, Turkey has frustrated other members of NATO by not only refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, but\xa0also by deepening its trade ties with Moscow. The Turkish government has stepped up imports of discounted Russian oil and gas, and Turkish companies have bolstered their exports to Russia, in many cases filling gaps left by European firms that have pulled out of the market.', 'Tens of thousands of Russians have settled in Turkey, bringing in foreign currency that has helped stabilize the country’s sagging economy. Some have established businesses, which American and other Western officials suspect could help Russia import products that it struggles to get elsewhere.', 'President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but he has maintained ties with Mr. Putin, casting himself as a necessary go-between.', 'Turkish officials have questioned the effectiveness of sanctions and said imposing them would damage the Turkish economy. But they have reassured their American counterparts that they do not want Turkey-based firms to help the Russian war effort.', 'Mr. Nelson made a similar push in the Emirates, also emphasizing the United States’ willingness to “take additional actions against those evading or facilitating the evasion of sanctions,” the Treasury Department said in a statement on Thursday.', 'The Emirates has come under pressure from American officials in the past over its role as a hub for the evasion of sanctions on Iran, its neighbor across the Persian Gulf and a historic trading partner.', 'Since the war in Ukraine began, the Emirates has also become a major destination for Russians, including middle-class visitors as well as rich oligarchs who have parked their yachts in its marinas and moved into its high-rises, driving a boom in luxury real estate.', 'Last month, the United States placed sanctions on an Emirates-based aviation firm, Kratol, accusing it of providing aircraft to the Wagner private military company close to Mr. Putin that\xa0it said were used to move “personnel and equipment” between the Central African Republic, Libya and Mali, the Treasury Department said.', 'Emirati officials have portrayed their country as a neutral mediator in the conflict, hosting a prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia while continuing to engage with Russian officials.', '“There are many Russians who are not sanctioned and are interested in safer havens,” Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the Emirates’ president, told reporters last year. “These nonsanctioned individuals have nothing to do with the war and trying to lump them together with bigger issues is problematic.”']"

It sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the Donetsk region and the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region, close to the only rail line linking Crimea with the Donbas region. The Ukrainians have used that proximity to lob artillery shells at the trains, limiting Russia’s ability to move men and equipment between the two fronts and, ultimately, to achieve its stated aim of capturing the Donbas, which comprises the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk.', 'After a major drive in November failed, with reportedly enormous losses, Russian commanders are once again attacking in and around Vuhledar in hopes of securing the rail line.', '“This can be done in only one way — by capturing and occupying Vuhledar, which just ‘hangs’ over this railway line,” said Ivan Yakovina, a prominent Ukrainian journalist and radio host.

It can be fired by the HIMARS launchers the United States has already supplied, but can hit targets more than 90 miles away, compared to about 50 miles for the rockets Ukraine now uses in the same launchers.', 'Last week, the United States and Germany, following Britain’s lead, agreed to send some of their advanced main battle tanks to Ukraine, weeks after pledging armored fighting vehicles, and on Friday Germany said it would make available older, less capable tanks, as well. Time and again, the West has sent Ukraine arms that it was at first reluctant to provide, fearing Russian escalation; the U.S. contribution now exceeds $29 billion since the invasion.', '“The more long-range our weapons are and the more mobile our troops are the sooner Russia’s brutal aggression will end,” Mr. Zelensky wrote on Twitter after news broke of the latest munitions.', 'But Russia still holds large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine, and is pouring tremendous resources into Mr. Putin’s effort to conquer the entire eastern region known as the Donbas. Both sides hope to launch new offensives in the coming weeks, and Ukrainian officials say stepped-up fighting may mean that the Russian effort has already begun.', 'Mr. Putin aims to capture the entire Donbas by March, Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said on national television on Friday. “The intensity we are currently observing in Donbas is an attempt to implement these plans,” he said.', 'The most intense combat has been centered on Bakhmut, which has taken on outsized meaning despite what independent analysts say is its limited strategic importance. The slogan “Bakhmut holds” has become a rallying cry for Ukrainians, while Russian forces have thrown wave after wave of troops to try to capture the area, claiming some success in villages and towns around the city.', 'The slow-moving battle has contributed greatly to casualties on both sides. Western officials recently estimated that Russia is approaching 200,000 dead and wounded in less than a year of fighting, while not offering figures for Ukrainian losses.', '“No one will give away Bakhmut,” Mr. Zelensky said at the news conference with E.U. officials. “We consider Bakhmut to be our fortress.”', 'But Ukraine’s hold on Bakhmut has grown increasingly precarious as Russian forces have closed in, creating what Mr. Zelensky has described as a “very tough” situation. After indicating they would hold out, Ukrainian leaders have previously made hard decisions to retreat, rather than risk having their forces encircled, pulling back last summer from the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, northeast of Bakhmut.', 'The war has crystallized Ukraine’s dependence on the West to fend off Russian domination — politically, economically and, now, militarily as well. Mr. Putin has long described the eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union to include former Soviet bloc nations and newly independent former Soviet republics — all seeking some distance and protection from Moscow — as both an offensive and an affront.', 'When NATO stated in 2008 that it planned to admit Ukraine — though not any time soon — Mr. Putin made clear that to him, the alliance had crossed an important red line. In 2013, Mr. Putin pressured Ukraine to abandon a planned trade pact with the European Union and enter one with Moscow, instead, prompting a popular uprising that drove Ukraine’s president into exile the next year. Mr. Putin responded by sending troops to seize Crimea and fomenting a separatist war in the Donbas.', 'With its infrastructure and economy in shambles because of the war, Ukraine now needs enormous sums of Western aid to prop up its daily operations and offer hope of reconstruction. In addition to promising more aid, E.U. officials said the bloc was preparing its 10th round of economic sanctions against Russia. And Ms. von der Leyen said member countries had agreed to cap the prices paid for Russian petroleum products, as they have limited what they pay for Russian crude oil.', 'Mr. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials hope that joining the European Union would unlock more aid as well as free trade to rebuild the country, and provide something of a shield against Russia.', 'But E.U. membership would require meeting the bloc’s standards for overhauling the economy, reining in corruption and public debt, ensuring competitive and fair elections, and safeguarding the independence of the courts and the media, as well as changing laws and regulations to comply with 80,000 pages of rules on matters ranging from environmental protection to food hygiene.', 'Several countries that have been candidates for years, including Turkey, are far ahead of Ukraine in the process, but are still not considered close to approval. And as Charles Michel, president of the European Council, the group of E.U. heads of government, noted on Friday, admitting another nation to the club would require the unanimous approval of the 27 that are already members.', 'Ukraine’s corruption problem, in particular, was a concern long before the war. This week, the government conducted a series of anti-corruption raids, some targeting powerful figures allied with Mr. Zelensky, signaling to Brussels that it takes the issue seriously.', 'Debate this week among diplomats over support for Ukraine came down to one word in the statement they issued after the meeting: “progress.”', 'While some E.U. nations wanted to recognize Ukraine’s “progress” toward meeting the bloc’s standards, others refused to go that far and insisted that the word be changed to “efforts,” according to four officials who participated in the meetings and spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to share details of the confidential discussions.', 'It ultimately took two meetings to settle the matter, but the more cautious language carried the day.', 'The statement cited “the considerable efforts that Ukraine demonstrated in the recent months towards meeting the objectives underpinning its candidate status for E.U. membership, welcomed Ukraine’s reform efforts in such difficult times, and encouraged the country to continue on this path.”']"

But Mr. Zelensky has pushed in particular for Patriot air defense systems to protect infrastructure from Russian airstrikes, and Western main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles for ground combat.', 'Last week, he also renewed his request for F-16 fighter jets that could potentially down Russian cruise missiles or could otherwise clear Ukraine’s airspace. Over the last two months alone, the United States and its allies have given in on almost all Ukraine’s weapons requests but the jets.', '“Since Russia is four times as populous as Ukraine, the Ukrainian armed forces need Western weapons to overmatch the Russian armed forces technologically, or else Ukraine will lose the war,” said Peter W. Mansoor, a retired Army colonel and armor officer who is now a military historian at Ohio State University.', 'But few of them are expected to arrive any time soon.', 'That varies from weapon to weapon. In the case of the longer-range missiles that were pledged Friday, most haven’t even been built yet.', 'Relatively cheap and usable in rocket launchers that have already been sent to Ukraine, these weapons, known as Small Diameter Bombs, are the Biden administration’s answer to Mr. Zelensky’s request for long-range munitions — without sending the most sophisticated American missiles that officials fear could be used to strike Russian territory.', 'Brigadier Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that the bombs will help Ukraine “to conduct operations in defense of their country and to take their sovereign territory in Russian occupied areas.”', 'The weapons are actually two different munitions: a 250-pound bomb attached to an older type of rocket.

Putin’s red lines.","['WASHINGTON — Last fall, tensions in Washington reached a crescendo as Moscow made persistent nuclear threats and U.S. intelligence reported discussions among Russian military leaders about the use of such weapons.', 'Concerns remain over Russia using a nuclear weapon, but the tensions have since abated. Several factors explain why, officials said: A more stable battlefield, China’s warnings against the use of nuclear weapons, improved communications between Moscow and Washington and an increased role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Ukraine have contributed to a measure of stability.', 'President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a senior U.S. official said recently, may well have come to the conclusion that the threats, which he once saw as leverage, were backfiring.', 'The possibility of nuclear escalation continues to influence American decisions over what advanced weaponry to give Ukraine. But nearly a year into the war there, American policymakers and intelligence analysts have more confidence that they understand at least some of Mr.\xa0Putin’s red lines — and what kinds of support for Ukraine will prompt statements of condemnation versus what might risk something more dangerous.', 'Inside the Biden administration, officials caution that Russia’s threats over nuclear escalation are not over, and that the next time the Kremlin wants to remind the West about the power of its arsenal, it could potentially move a nuclear weapon that it knows can be observed by the United States. The U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations.', 'The Pentagon continues to war game what might happen if Mr. Putin moves tactical weapons into position as a reminder that he can back up his conventional forces. But overwrought threats, in the absence of other intelligence, are causing little stir. A nuclear threat last month by Dmitri Medvedev, the former Russian president who serves as a deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, was met mostly with shrugs in the United States.', 'This week, in response to Germany’s decision to supply Ukraine with tanks, Mr. Putin delivered a veiled warning. “We aren’t sending our tanks to their borders,” he said. “But we have the means to respond, and it won’t end with the use of armor. Everyone must understand this.”', 'At a speech in Washington on Thursday, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said the United States had to take seriously the nuclear “saber rattling” of Mr. Putin and his advisers. Mr. Burns added that he had made clear to Russian officials the serious consequences of any use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.', '“It is a risk we cannot afford to take lightly; on the other hand, the purpose of the saber rattling is to intimidate us, as well as our European allies and the Ukrainians themselves,” he said. “So I think we have to stay on an even keel in weighing those threats carefully but also not being intimidated by them.”', 'Heightened nuclear fears in October came against the backdrop of a successful counteroffensive by the Ukrainian military when it\xa0reclaimed a huge swath of territory east of Kharkiv, in the northeast. It then\xa0made a drive at Kherson, in the south, forcing the Russian military to eventually retreat from there. With their army in disarray, Mr. Putin and other Russian officials warned against Ukraine’s use of a so-called dirty bomb: a crude device that spreads radiological material but does not create a nuclear reaction. U.S. officials were unsure what Moscow might do.', 'As winter set in and Russia managed to pull its forces from Kherson in a relatively orderly retreat, the battlefield stabilized. Intense fighting remains around Bakhmut, in the Donbas region, but there are no drastic territorial shifts. In the south, the Russians have dug in, intensifying their defenses; they do not appear to be on the brink of a collapse that could make their leaders think that only the use of a tactical nuclear weapon could stave off defeat.', 'U.S. officials also credit an improved dialogue with Moscow, at least over nuclear issues.', 'Amid Russia’s battlefield failures, U.S. intelligence concluded that Russian military officials had discussed situations in which a tactical nuclear weapon could be used. Two calls between Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, worried Washington because Mr. Shoigu had raised concerns about Ukraine’s possible use of a dirty bomb.', 'The claims were propaganda, but some U.S. officials said Russian officials appeared to believe their own disinformation. Getting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors into Ukraine — and, in early November, when the agency found no evidence of a dirty bomb — helped ease tensions.', 'A\xa0call in late October between Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his counterpart, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, Russia’s chief of the general staff, also relieved tensions. In the call, according to two U.S. officials, General Gerasimov outlined a use of nuclear weapons consistent with Washington’s understanding of Russia’s nuclear doctrine.', 'Mr. Burns also met with his counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, in Turkey to warn Russia about its nuclear threats. The purpose of the trip, Mr. Burns said\xa0on\xa0Thursday, was “to make very clear the serious consequences of any use of tactical nuclear weapons.” The meeting, officials said, opened up a new line of communication with Russian leadership.', 'President Biden has been criticized for being overly cautious in sending assistance to Ukraine, but U.S. officials insist his top priority is ensuring that the war does not escalate into a nuclear conflict between Russia and the West. And while American officials have a better sense of what actions will prompt Russian reaction, determining what might provoke Mr. Putin is imperfect.', '“This is a very dynamic situation,” Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said after a visit to Kyiv last month. “It’s a day-to-day basis on what’s a red line.”', 'Administration officials say they are trying to distinguish between Mr. Putin’s threats and his actual opportunities to use nuclear weapons, in hopes of cutting those off.', 'So far, they have no evidence that he is moving nuclear weapons toward the battlefield, though they note that with some of his tactical weapons — small battlefield arms, including some that can fit into an artillery shell — they might not see such movement. But the officials expect that if Mr. Putin wants to raise the level of alarm, he will make a public show of transferring weapons or make sure Western allies pick up chatter among the units that control those weapons.', '“We don’t have any indication that Mr. Putin has any intention to use weapons of mass destruction — let alone nuclear weapons, tactical or otherwise,” John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said at a news briefing last week. “We monitor as best we can, and we believe that — that our strategic deterrent posture is appropriate. But we have seen no indication that that’s in the offing.”', 'U.S. officials have repeatedly said publicly that Russia might use a nuclear weapon if Mr. Putin’s grip on power was threatened, if Moscow thought NATO would directly enter the war in Ukraine, or the Russian army faced a sudden, catastrophic defeat.', 'Throughout the war in Ukraine, U.S. officials have developed a more refined, though imperfect, sense of what actions might escalate the conflict. Weapons sent to the country — even those with increasingly advanced abilities — have so far not provoked a response from Russia, given that Ukraine has been using them within its borders.', 'But the ever-changing battlefield dynamics could\xa0shift the Russian calculus on the use of nuclear weapons.', 'Still, their use makes little sense for Russia, U.S. officials insist — not least because it could potentially alienate countries that have either explicitly supported Russia or remained neutral.', 'The United States and its allies say that appealing to Russia’s partners is vital to warning Moscow against a nuclear weapon. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, whose support Mr. Putin needs, issued an explicit warning — pushed in part by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany during his visit to Beijing in November. The German diplomatic push came with the support of the United States, several U.S. officials said.', 'Mr. Scholz said publicly that his joint statement with Mr. Xi on the use of nuclear weapons justified his visit to Beijing.', '“Because the Chinese government, the president and I were able to declare that no nuclear weapons should be used in this war,” Mr. Scholz said, “that alone made the whole trip worthwhile.”']"

Andrij Penjuk, a priest and longtime resident from Ukraine. “Nobody here shouted, ‘Russians go home,’ but I don’t miss them.”', 'Many, however, do miss them, particularly hotel and spa owners who used to make much of their money pampering Russians.', '“Maybe I’m a bad person, but I don’t want to suffer for Ukraine,” said Ali Mirzayev, a Russian-speaking hotelier and tour operator from Azerbaijan.

They know that openly supporting Russian crimes in Ukraine is a criminal offense.”', 'Local Ukrainians, many of them Orthodox Christians, used to pray at the Russian cathedral, but after Russia invaded their country and the Moscow patriarch started cheering on Russian troops, they nearly all stopped going there.

She stormed over to their table and shouted, “You know nothing about Ukraine and know nothing about what Russia is doing there!”']"

Putin’s invasion has gone, according to American and other Western officials.', 'While the officials caution that casualties are notoriously difficult to estimate, particularly because Moscow is believed to routinely undercount its war dead and injured, they say the slaughter from fighting in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and the town of Soledar has ballooned what was already a heavy toll.', 'With Moscow desperate for a major battlefield victory and viewing Bakhmut as the key to seizing the entire eastern Donbas area, the Russian military has sent poorly trained recruits and former convicts to the front lines, straight into the path of Ukrainian shelling and machine guns. The result, American officials say, has been hundreds of troops killed or injured a day.', 'Russia analysts say that the loss of life is unlikely to be a deterrent to Mr. Putin’s war aims. He has no political opposition at home and has framed the war as the kind of struggle the country faced in World War II, when more than 8 million Soviet troops died. U.S. officials have said that they believe that Mr. Putin can sustain hundreds of thousands of casualties in Ukraine, although higher numbers could cut into his political support.', 'Ukraine’s casualty figures are also difficult to ascertain, given Kyiv’s reluctance to disclose its own wartime losses. But in Bakhmut, hundreds of Ukrainian troops have been wounded and killed daily at times as well, officials said. Better trained infantry formations are kept in reserve to safeguard them, while lesser prepared troops, such as those in the territorial defense units, are kept on the front line and bear the brunt of shelling.', 'The last public Biden administration estimate of casualties came last November, when Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that more than 100,000 troops on each side had been killed and wounded since the war began. At the time, officials said privately that the numbers were closer to 120,000.', '“I would say it’s significantly well over 100,000 now,” General Milley said at a news conference last month in Germany, adding that the Russian toll included “regular military, and also their mercenaries in the Wagner Group.”', 'At two meetings last month between senior military and defense officials from NATO and partner countries, officials said the fighting in the Donbas had turned into, as one of them put it, a meat grinder.', 'On Norwegian TV on Jan. 22, Gen. Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway’s defense chief, said estimates were that Russia had suffered 180,000 dead and wounded, while Ukraine had 100,000 killed or wounded in action along with 30,000 civilian deaths.

The two sides exchanged several thousand rounds of artillery fire each day, while the Wagner private military company, which has been central to Russia’s efforts there, had essentially begun using recruited convicts as cannon fodder, the official told reporters. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details.', 'The convicts took the brunt of the Ukrainian response while the group’s more seasoned fighters moved in behind them to claim ground, the official said. Wagner has recruited some 50,000 troops to fight in Ukraine, according to senior American military and defense officials.', 'Thousands of the convicts have been killed, a loss of life that has shocked American officials, who say the strategic value of Bakhmut simply is not in line with the price Russia has paid.', 'In an interview on Tuesday, a senior Defense Department official pointed to myriad military supply and tactical problems to explain the Russian tactics. The Russian military is running low on critical supplies and replenishment, said Colin H. Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy. “They’re running low on artillery. They’re running low on standoff munitions, and they are substituting by sending convicts in human waves into places like Bakhmut and Soledar.”', 'The Russian military has been following the Wagner playbook and deliberately using the poorly trained troops to draw, and deplete, Ukrainian fire, senior American military and defense officials said.

From an operational perspective, this is a very unfair deal for the Ukrainians and a clever tactical move from the Russian side.”', 'Moscow has thrown people it sees as expendable into battles for decades, if not centuries. During World War II, Joseph Stalin sent close to one million prisoners to the front. Boris Sokolov, a Russia historian, describes in a piece called “Gulag Reserves” in the Russian opposition magazine Grani.ru that an additional one million “special settlers”— deportees and others viewed by the Soviet government as second-class citizens — were also forced to fight during World War II.', '“In essence, it does not matter how big the Russian losses are, since their overall human resource is much greater than Ukraine’s,” Mr. Salm, the Estonian official, said in a follow-up email. “In Russia the life of a soldier is worth nothing. A dead soldier, on the other hand, is a hero, regardless of how he died. All lost soldiers can be replaced, and the number of losses will not shift the public opinion against the war.”']"

The Biden administration says no, and quietly suggests that Ukraine could get the same type of weapon from its European neighbors, in half the time.', 'But NATO countries in Europe, still smarting from President Donald J. Trump’s oft-spoken wish to break up the alliance, refuse to commit to sending anything to Ukraine that would provoke Russia unless the United States is right in there with them. So, after months of hemming and hawing, the Biden administration says yes, and the gates to more weapons open.', 'So it was with air defense systems, when President Biden decided in late December to send a Patriot battery to Ukraine, and Germany and the Netherlands then announced that they too would send Patriot launchers and missiles. So it was with armored fighting vehicles, with France and Germany opening up their larders once the Biden administration signaled in January that it would send Bradleys. So it was with tanks, with Germany agreeing to send Leopard 2 tanks once the Biden administration agreed to send the American M1A2 Abrams.', 'Now it is the fighter jets, the latest item on the Ukrainian acquisition wish list. Kyiv has asked for dozens of F-16s, the single-engine fighter jet developed in the 1970s by General Dynamics and the U.S. Air Force. Almost 50 years later, American Air Force pilots are still flying the F-16, as are pilots in a host of U.S. partner nations.', 'Ukraine wants them, both to provide air support for troops as they seek to reclaim cities and towns in the east and the south where Russian troops have dug in, and to protect their cities and towns from Moscow’s attack planes.', 'Following the usual script, the Biden administration is saying no — but officials hasten to say, privately, that no is probably temporary.', 'After Mr. Biden said “no” when a reporter asked on Monday if the United States would provide F-16 fighters to Ukraine, senior officials quickly followed up in conversations afterward. Several said Mr. Biden’s “no” did not preclude the administration from deciding later to provide F-16s or, more likely, working out an agreement that would allow another country to send its own American-made F-16s to Ukraine.', '“We are constantly talking to the Ukrainians, and we are constantly talking to our allies and partners about capabilities that they need,” John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday.', 'In a post on his Telegram channel on Monday, Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that “the work on obtaining F-16 fighters is ongoing,” adding that Ukraine had seen “positive signs from Poland, which is ready to transfer them in coordination with NATO.”', 'But American and European officials say it is more likely that such transfers would come from Denmark or the Netherlands. The Dutch cabinet would consider a request from Kyiv for F-16s with an “open mind,” the Dutch news site NL Times quoted Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying last month.', 'The Netherlands has around 40 F-16s, and is transitioning to the more advanced F-35 fighter (also made by Lockheed Martin), so sending some of its F-16s to Ukraine would make sense, American officials said.', 'The U.S. government must approve sales or transfers of F-16s from partner nations to third-party countries, which means that any NATO member that wants to send its American-made fighter jets to Ukraine must first get a green light from the Biden administration.', 'That permission, two officials said, could help reassure NATO countries that are concerned about being singled out by Russia for sending the advanced fighter planes to Ukraine.', '“We have a pattern; if we say we will provide categories of equipment, then our allies will do so,” said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Ukraine during the Obama administration. “They seem to be super afraid of Russia directing ire at any one NATO country.”', 'In the case of the Abrams tanks, just the announcement last week that the United States would send them was enough to unlock the German Leopard 2 tanks, even though the Pentagon says the Abrams probably will not arrive on the battlefield for months, if not years. Britain’s earlier pledge to send its Challenger tanks was not enough to bring the rest of Europe along, officials acknowledge. ', 'At the moment, the Biden administration views advanced fighter aircraft as something a modern Ukrainian Air Force will undoubtedly get directly from the United States, but in the future. Pentagon officials say they want to prioritize weapons that can help Kyiv right now. The Biden administration is preparing a new weapons package for Ukraine, administration officials said this week. The package, at $2.2 billion, is expected to include longer-range rockets, but those would most likely not be delivered for several months, if not years.', 'Bigger and better weapons that are publicly promised but not delivered right away still serve a purpose, American officials said, of sending a message to Russia. A Ukrainian military that is fortified by fighter jets and tanks in perhaps a year would be able to mount counteroffensives to take back territory seized by Moscow.', 'Officials say the top priorities for Ukraine right now are air defense systems, artillery and then armored and mechanized systems.', 'But Ukraine, whose pilots fly Soviet-era jets, including MiG-29s, has been adamant that it wants Western fighters.', 'Because so many U.S. allies have F-16s, the supply chain for the advanced fighters is well supported around the world, which would make it easier for Ukraine to maintain them, said Michael Fantini, a retired major general who flew F-16s during the Iraq war. He called the fighter the “most maneuverable ever built, with the exception of the F-22” — another fighter jet.', 'He said the plane could make a “significant contribution” on the battlefields and in the skies above Ukraine.', 'Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said in a briefing last week that it would take Ukrainian pilots a “couple of weeks” to learn how to fly the fighters but “about six months” to master how to fight with the aircraft.', 'President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Monday that his country had not ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine, but he laid out several conditions. Among them: that providing such equipment would not lead to an escalation of tensions or be used “to touch Russian soil,” Mr. Macron said.', 'American officials say that after a year of warning the Ukrainians not to fire Western weaponry into Russia, the Ukrainian military has earned their trust.']"

Now, they are warning that the campaign is underway, with the Kremlin seeking to reshape the battlefield and seize the momentum.', '“I think it has started,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said this week.', 'Along the undulating front line in eastern Ukraine, artillery never goes silent for long. The roads in Ukrainian-held areas are largely empty, except for tanks and armored personnel carriers and huge trucks filled with boxes of ammunition. The few gas stations still operating are crowded with soldiers savoring hot coffee before returning to the fight.', 'Hospitals near the front lines are busy, but not overflowing. At one major triage hospital, there are long stretches of quiet and then, suddenly, a parade of ambulances arrives, filling the corridors with wounded soldiers in various stages of consciousness.', 'Fierce fighting is concentrated around the forlorn eastern city of Bakhmut, where Russian forces have been slowly closing in on vital supply lines. Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago, Bakhmut had a population of about 70,000 people. But most of those living in the battered city fled long ago, and on Tuesday night the mayor, Oleksiy Reva, pleaded with the roughly 6,500 who remained to evacuate.', '“The city is under constant hostile fire,” he said in a statement. “The enemy does not spare anyone! How much will you ignore the danger?!”', 'Ukraine and Russia have been locked in grueling combat for nearly a year. Since the fall, when Ukraine reclaimed territory through counteroffensives in the northeast and south, the fight in the east has congealed into muddy and frozen trenches, each army facing significant losses while managing only negligible gains.', 'Both sides have been readying for heavier ground combat, with Moscow pressing its goal to capture the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and Kyiv aiming to drive Russian troops out of the country completely.', 'The Russian approach shifted last month after the Kremlin named Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov to take over its struggling war effort. Since then, Moscow has steadily added forces in Donbas, seeking to do with overwhelming manpower what it has so far failed to do with firepower: break through lines that have been fortified for nine years, going back to when Russia first fomented rebellion in Ukraine’s east.', 'Ukrainian intelligence estimates that Russia now has more than 320,000 soldiers in the country — roughly twice the size of Moscow’s initial invasion force.

It might be escalating fighting along the eastern front to divert Ukrainian resources and hurt Kyiv’s ability to launch its own offensive. It could be planning a drive from occupied territory in eastern Ukraine to push deeper into the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which make up Donbas.', 'The only matter of consensus is that Russia is not satisfied with the territory it has taken and is maintaining its ultimate goal of subjugating Ukraine.

Russia intensified its effort to capture Bakhmut, which may be key to seizing the entire Donbas area, after months of bombardment beginning in the summer yielded few gains.', '“The situation is very tough,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a recent nightly address after meeting with military leaders. He said, “There are constant attempts to break through our defense.”', 'Over the course of the war, firepower has proved critical to Russian gains, but the battle for Bakhmut has been different.', 'Increasingly, Ukrainian fighters and analysts say, Moscow has been relying on a cruder tactic: trying to tip the city into its win column through the sheer weight of troop numbers. As a result, the Ukrainians say, Russian casualties in recent fighting in Bakhmut have been higher than in previous months.', 'Part of Russia’s evolving strategy appears to be to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with waves of soldiers, many drawn from President Vladimir V. Putin’s call-up of 300,000 men in September. That would be a departure from Moscow’s summer campaigns elsewhere in the Donbas, when artillery pounded cities for weeks before Russia launched a sustained ground offensive.', 'In Bakhmut, Ukraine, too, has suffered heavy casualties. But the calculation for each side is not the same.', 'Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va., said the battle there has cost Russia more in human losses, because its fighters have often fought on foot, unsupported by armored vehicles. But while Ukraine’s losses may be fewer in number, he said on a recent episode of a military affairs podcast, War on the Rocks, they may be more painful.', 'Many of the troops fighting for Russia around Bakhmut have been recruited from prison, and are less well trained than many of the soldiers Russia began the war with. Ukraine has mostly relied on national guard and other forces to hold its main defensive line in Bakhmut, with better-trained infantry units rushing in if those fighters are attacked or retreat.', '“Ukraine’s been forced to essentially trade higher-quality troops to hold Bakhmut against expendable Russian forces,” Mr. Kofman said on the podcast. That, he said, could “impede Ukrainian plans for an offensive down the line.”', 'Bakhmut’s strategic value, military analysts say, is as a crossroads for some of the region’s highways. Capturing the city, which is in Donetsk Province, would not guarantee that Moscow could make major advances in the east, but it would put Russian forces in better position to do so.', 'Despite suffering setbacks elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and in the south, since last fall, Russian troops edging toward Bakhmut from the east have gradually squeezed the city. This month, they took the salt mining town of Soledar, six miles to the northeast.', 'To the south, Ukrainian soldiers who recently left the front line said that a paved road that had been their main supply route into Bakhmut was now within range of Russian artillery and tanks, though still in Ukrainian hands. This leaves Ukraine relying on a road west to the town of Chasiv Yar, itself the target of frequent Russian attacks and harder to traverse.', 'In past battles in the Donbas, Russian forces have often aimed to encircle a city first, leaving Ukraine to decide whether to expend costly resources to defend it. The pitched battle over Bakhmut suggests that Ukraine has overcome its qualms about engaging directly in a drawn-out fight for a city and is prepared to sustain losses in the hope that it can deplete its enemy’s strength still further.', 'On Tuesday, fighting was also ranging elsewhere in Donetsk, in the town of Vuhledar.', 'Moscow has moved from small-scale probing attacks around the town to a more concentrated assault, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday, two days after Mr. Zelensky described Vuhledar as among the areas “under constant Russian attack.”', 'The town, which had a prewar population of around 14,000, has been almost destroyed, but a Ukrainian military official emphasized on Tuesday that it was still under Kyiv’s control.', 'Military analysts say that Ukrainian forces have been using their positions in and around Vuhledar to launch attacks on the region’s main railway hub in the occupied town of Volnovakha, less than 10 miles away, in a bid to weaken Russia’s resupply efforts. The head of Ukraine’s regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Tuesday that there had been “intense fire” in the area.', 'In the coming weeks and months, as both sides prepare for the offensives expected in the spring, Ukraine will be strengthened by new weaponry, including tanks and rocket systems supplied by the United States and other allies.', 'On Tuesday, the French defense minister announced that his country would deliver 12 more Caesar howitzers to Ukraine and step up efforts to train Ukrainian soldiers, a significant increase in military aid from a country that had recently shown reluctance to part with more of its advanced artillery.', 'And last week, the United States and Germany agreed, after a prolonged Ukrainian campaign, to provide battle tanks to Ukraine, among other military aid. Ukraine is also pressing its allies for jet fighters, although President Biden has resisted sending Ukraine F-16s.', 'But for now, the many new troops drafted in the fall are giving Moscow an advantage.']"

On the first morning of the invasion, Novikova was shaken out of bed by a deafening sound: A military plane had crashed near her home, on the outskirts of Kyiv.', '“My previous life ended at that moment,” she told me last summer in The Hague, a tidily beautiful city near the coast where I had gone to report on the lives of dancers in the United Ukrainian Ballet, an ad hoc assemblage of refugee dancers from all over that country.', 'The company began to take shape last March through the efforts of the Dutch dancer Igone de Jongh, and has toured the Netherlands, and traveled to London, Australia and Singapore. This week, starting Wednesday, it will make its United States debut at the Kennedy Center in Washington in Alexei Ratmansky’s staging of the 19th-century classic “Giselle.”', 'Elizaveta Gogidze, one of three dancers cast in the title role, said she was excited to get acquainted with American culture. “I would like to show, of course, a Ukrainian ballet to American audiences,” she said. “And remind them with the help of Ukrainian ballet art about the terrible war which has been going on for almost a year.”', 'On the eve of their American journey, I checked in with Ratmansky and some of the dancers I had met last summer to talk about how their lives had taken shape in the months since I had seen them.', 'Ratmansky, who is of mixed Russian and Ukrainian background and grew up in Kyiv, has been working with the company on and off in The Hague since June, both as a choreographer and as an adviser to de Jongh, with whom he had worked when she was a star at the Dutch National Ballet.', 'It has been a powerful experience for Ratmansky, who lives in New York and who, it was recently announced, is to become choreographer in residence at New York City Ballet. Working with the Ukrainian dancers is part of what he feels is a mission to “demonstrate that Ukrainians are fighting on all fields including cultural,” he said in a recent interview.', '“I am supporting them with all my heart,” he said of the dancers. “I just feel I need to do it.”', 'Ratmansky’s version of the ghost story “Giselle” is both familiar and unfamiliar, with surprising nuances he has gleaned from archival sources, most strikingly, a hopeful ending in place of the usual bleak one.', 'In addition to “Giselle,” he has given the company permission to perform his recent dance for Pacific Northwest Ballet, “Wartime Elegy,” set to music by the contemporary Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov, who was himself forced to flee Ukraine by the war, and Ukrainian folk music. The company will perform it in March as part of a triple bill that also includes ballets by Jiri Kylian and the duo Paul Lightfoot and Sol León, who have been rehearsing with the company.', 'For many of these dancers, it is their first introduction to collaborating with internationally recognized contemporary choreographers, an experience that Gogidze said would help to enrich Ukrainian ballet culture once they return home. “When I heard I would be able to work with Alexei Ratmansky, I said, of course I want to be part of it. It has made me a better dancer. I want to bring something new to Ukrainian ballet from Europe.”', 'Gogidze, who joined the company in June, is planning, despite the dangers, to return to Kyiv, and to her home company, the National Ballet of Ukraine — where Ratmansky too began his dancing career — after the tour to Washington.', 'The National Ballet is active again, though performances are often interrupted by sirens that send patrons and performers scurrying into bomb shelters below ground. “Of course it’s not easy,” Gogidze said, “but it’s my theater, and they have a lot of work now.”', '“I’m really proud of the people who are working there now,” Veronika Rakitina, a former dancer in the national company, said. “People really want to see ballet, even if there are alarms. It’s like a small light in the dark for them.”', 'Some, like Gogidze, have returned or plan to do soon; others, like the dancer Stanislav Olshanskyi, have found work elsewhere. In November, Olshanskyi joined Miami City Ballet, where he recently debuted in Balanchine’s “The Nutcracker.” On Instagram, he posts avidly about both the war and his new life in Miami.', 'But most, like Rakitina and her boyfriend, Vladyslav Detiuchenko, a dancer with the Kyiv Modern Ballet, have opted to stay in The Hague, at least for now. She arrived in April, with the couple’s cat, Boston. Detiuchenko came a few months later, after receiving a special permit from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture to leave the country to promote Ukrainian culture abroad. (Men of fighting age are generally not allowed to go abroad.)', 'The pair, along with the other dancers, have settled in The Hague’s former music conservatory. The company’s home since its founding, the conservatory serves as dormitory, kitchen, laundromat and rehearsal space. It has all the basics, but few comforts. Most sleeping areas, carved out of former classrooms, are shared, as are bathrooms. The floors are cement, and the donated furniture is worn. “If you’re just here for a few days, it’s all right,” Gogidze said, “but for a long time, it’s hard.”', 'The conservatory building had been slated for demolition before it was repurposed as a home for the dancers. With the demolition date drawing near, the company will move to a newer space, a former rehabilitation center in the district of Kijkduin, close to the sea.', 'The Odessa-born Christine Shevchenko, a principal dancer at American Ballet Theater who also will dance Giselle in Washington, spent time at the conservatory last year. “It was a little overwhelming,” she said, “but at the same time as soon as I started rehearsals, I felt like I was pretty much at home. I had this sense of happiness that I was there with these people from my country who are just like me, standing with them.”', 'And then there were the children. Several of the dancers had arrived in The Hague with kids who played in the halls while their parents rehearsed. Matvei, then 7, the son of Volodymyr Tkachenko, who teaches company class a few times a week, seemed to be everywhere at once, including in rehearsals and onstage with the dancers.', 'Now Matvei and the other children are attending school in The Hague. “He goes to school, and then after school we play football, work on his homework, and spend time together,” Tkachenko said. “I think he is happy.”', 'Like the others, Tkachenko expressed gratitude that he and his son were safe, that they had been received warmly by the residents of The Hague, and that he was working. And like all of them, he worries about relatives and friends back home, including his parents, whose house was destroyed by a missile last year but who refuse to leave.', 'When asked what his hopes were, Tkachenko said, “I don’t think about tomorrow. I think about today.”', 'Performances and tours, like the shows in Washington, give the daily rituals of dancing life a sense of purpose. “The world should not get used to this war,” Novikova said. “We must remind everyone around the world that we are a peaceful nation, that we have our culture and we deserve a right to exist. No one deserves to be killed for that.”']"

Poland, an early advocate of sending German-made tanks to Ukraine, has stressed that it coordinates weapons decisions with other NATO members.', 'And Wopke Hoekstra, the foreign minister of another NATO member, the Netherlands, recently told Dutch lawmakers that the government would be willing to send American-made F-16 jets if the United States authorized the transfer.', 'However, on Monday, President Biden, asked by a reporter whether the United States would provide F-16 fighter jets, said it would not. The White House declined to comment on a question about whether Mr. Biden was ruling out the use of the jets entirely or just an immediate transfer of them.', 'Other leaders have been more direct. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany reiterated recently that Berlin would not send fighter jets to Ukraine. “That we are not talking about fighter aircraft is something I made clear very early on, and I’m making that clear here as well,” he said in an announcement that Germany would send Ukraine tanks.', 'On Monday, Britain’s defense minister, Ben Wallace, acknowledged the questions about aircraft in remarks to members of Parliament.', '“Since we took on the battle over getting tanks to Ukraine, people are understandably asking what will be the next capability,” he said. “What we know about all these demands is that the initial response is no, but the eventual response is yes.”', 'Britain, Mr. Wallace said, would track the progress of discussions among Western allies, but noted that decisions about military aid are not “an ad hoc thing.”', 'Last week, the U.S. stance seemed flexible.

Now, Andrei Yastrebov, who was among tens of thousands of convict soldiers, is part of a return from the battlefield with potentially serious implications for Russian society.', 'Mr. Yastrebov, 22, who had been serving time for theft, returned home a changed man. “We all feel like he is in some sort of hypnosis, like he is a different person,” said a relative of his, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “He is without any emotions.”', 'Thousands of convicts have been killed, many within days or even hours of arriving at the front, Russian rights advocates and Ukrainian officials say. Those who live and return home largely remain silent, wary of retribution if they speak out.', 'President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to allow a mercenary group to recruit Russian convicts in support of his flagging war effort marks a watershed in his 23-year rule, say human rights activists and legal experts. The policy circumvents Russian legal precedent and, by returning some brutalized criminals to their homes with pardons, risks triggering greater violence throughout society, underlining the cost Mr. Putin is prepared to pay to avoid defeat.', 'Since July, around 40,000 inmates have joined the Russian forces, according to Western intelligence agencies, the Ukrainian government and a prisoners’ rights association, Russia Behind Bars, which combines reports from informers across Russian jails. Ukraine claims that nearly 30,000 have deserted or been killed or wounded, although that number could not be independently verified.', 'Most of the enlisted men were serving time for petty crimes like robbery and theft, but records from one penal colony seen by The New York Times show that the recruits also included men convicted of aggravated rape and multiple murders.', '“There are no more crimes, and no more punishments,” said Olga Romanova, the head of Russia Behind Bars. “Anything is permissible now, and this brings very far-reaching consequences for any country.”', 'More than six months ago, Russia’s largest private military company, Wagner, and its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, began systematically recruiting convicts on a scale not seen since World War II to bolster a bloody assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Yet the operation remains largely cloaked in secrecy and propaganda.', 'Wagner has been able to avoid oversight by exploiting the most marginalized Russian citizens, the 350,000 male inmates of its harsh penal colonies, said human rights activists and lawyers.', 'Dozens of survivors from the first inmate assault units began filtering back to Russia this month with medals, sizable payouts and documents that Wagner claims grant them freedom. The releases are likely to accelerate as Wagner’s six-month service contracts expire, potentially confronting Russian society with the challenge of reintegrating thousands of traumatized men with military training, a history of crime and few job prospects.', '“These are psychologically broken people who are returning with a sense of righteousness, a belief that they have killed to defend the Motherland,” said Yana Gelmel, a Russian prisoner rights lawyer who works with enlisted inmates. “These can be very dangerous people.”', 'Neither Mr. Prigozhin, through his press office, nor Russia’s penal service provided comment.', 'To document the recruitment drive, The Times interviewed rights activists, lawyers, legal workers, relatives of recruited inmates, deserters and prisoners who decided to remain behind bars but maintain contact with companions on the front lines.', 'They described a sophisticated system of incentives and brutality built by Wagner, with the Kremlin’s support, to refill Russia’s decimated military ranks using questionable, and possibly illegal, methods.', 'Andrei Medvedev said he joined Wagner within days of finishing his prison term for theft in southern Russia. A former convict with military experience, he says he was put in charge of a detachment of prisoners who were dispatched on nearly suicidal missions around Bakhmut. ', '“We were told: ‘Keep going until you’re killed,’” Mr. Medvedev said in a phone interview from Russia after deserting in November. He has since escaped to Norway and applied for political asylum.', 'The campaign to recruit convicts began in early July, when Mr. Prigozhin started appearing in prisons around his native St. Petersburg with a radical proposal for the inmates: paying their debt to society by joining his private army in Ukraine.', 'In videos published on social media, Mr. Prigozhin promised the prisoners they would receive 100,000 rubles a month — the equivalent of $1,700 at the time, and nearly double Russia’s average monthly wage. He also offered bravery bonuses, $80,000 death payouts and, should they survive the six-month contract, freedom in the form of a presidential pardon.', 'Those who ran away, used drugs or alcohol or had sexual relations, he warned, would be killed.', '“There are no chances of returning to the colony,” Mr. Prigozhin said in a speech to inmates published in September. “Those who get there and say ‘I think I’m in the wrong place’ will be marked as deserters and shot.”', 'A former inmate himself, Mr. Prigozhin understood prison culture, skillfully combining a threat of punishment with a promise of a new, dignified life, according to rights activists and families.', '“He didn’t go for the money, he was too proud for that,” said Anastasia, about a relative who enlisted with Wagner as a prisoner. “He went because he was ashamed in front of his mother, he wanted to clear his name.”', 'Mr. Prigozhin’s prison visits immediately raised legal questions. Mercenary recruitment is illegal in Russia, and until last year Mr. Prigozhin had denied that Wagner even existed.', 'On paper, the prisoners never went to war, but were merely transferred to Russian jails near the Ukrainian border, according to information requests filed by their relatives.', 'When Anastasia, who asked that her last name not be used, tried to find the whereabouts of her enlisted relative at his prison, she said the guards merely told her that he was unavailable.', 'Igor Matyukhin was a convicted thief who decided to join.', 'A 26-year-old Siberian orphan, Mr. Matyukhin said he was serving his third sentence in the remote Krasnoyarsk region when Mr. Prigozhin arrived by helicopter in November, offering eventual freedom in return for enlistment.', 'Driven by the chance of a new life, Mr. Matyukhin immediately signed up. Days later, he was at a training camp near the occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk. What he found there, he said, was very different from the patriotic band of brothers he had been led to expect.', 'Mr. Matyukhin described a climate of fear instilled by Wagner to keep convicts fighting. He said they were threatened with summary executions, and at least one man in his unit was taken away after disobeying orders and never returned.', 'When his training camp came under a surprise Ukrainian attack, Mr. Matyukhin seized the opportunity to escape in the confusion. He said he has since been trying to return to his prison from a hiding place in Russia.', 'A relative of Mr. Matyukhin confirmed that he had enlisted in Wagner, but other aspects of his war account could not be independently verified. ', 'To lift declining recruitment numbers, Wagner has lately been playing up the rewards for survivors, releasing videos of returned prisoners being granted freedom.', '“I needed your criminal talents to kill the enemy in the war,” Mr. Prigozhin said in one video. “Those who want to return, we are waiting for you to come back. Those who want to get married, get baptized, study — go ahead with a blessing.”', 'In some videos, the inmates are given papers described as pardons or annulments of convictions. However, none of these documents have been made public, raising questions about their legitimacy. Rights advocates say pardons are rare, time-consuming and complex legal procedures that have never been issued in Russia on anywhere near the scale advertised by Wagner.', 'Only Mr. Putin can issue a pardon under the Russian Constitution, and the Kremlin has not published such decrees since 2020. In 2021, Mr. Putin pardoned just six people, according to the Kremlin.', 'Mr. Putin’s press secretary, Dmitri S. Peskov, on Friday told reporters that Wagner’s enlisted convicts are being pardoned “in strict adherence to Russian law.” He declined further comment, implying the procedure was a state secret.', '“There are open decrees and decrees with various degrees of secrecy,” he said.', 'Under Russian law, all pardon petitions are evaluated by specialized regional committees before arriving at the Kremlin. However, two members of such commissions said they had not received any petitions from enlisted convicts. One of those officials represents the city of St. Petersburg, the residence of Mr. Yastrebov.', 'Rights activists say the returning inmates’ ambiguous legal status undermines Russia’s justice system and ties their fate to Wagner.', 'After spending just three weeks at home, Mr. Yastrebov said he was already getting ready to return to the front, despite the extraordinary casualty rates suffered by his prison’s unit, according to Russia Behind Bars.', '“I want to defend the Motherland,” he said in a brief interview on Friday. “I liked everything over there.

The statement came a day after Russia’s Wagner group, a private military company that has conducted much of the fighting around Bakhmut on Moscow’s behalf, claimed that its forces had captured Blahodatne, near a key supply line for Ukrainian forces.', '“Blahodatne is under our control,” Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and the head of the Wagner group, said on Saturday in a statement posted on a website for one of his companies. Russia’s defense ministry has not confirmed the report and the claim could not be independently verified. Mr. Prigozhin has sought to cast his mercenaries as the most effective fighting force in the area and previously has claimed credit for battlefield advances ahead of Kremlin confirmation.', 'Blahodatne lies between Soledar, a salt-mining town that Russian forces recently captured after weeks of intense fighting, and a road that runs north from the city of Bakhmut. The road serves as a crucial supply line for Ukrainian forces defending the city.', 'Since the summer, Bakhmut has become a focal point of the fighting in eastern Ukraine and the target of Moscow’s most significant attack. Moscow aims to encircle Bakhmut, cut off its supply routes and then force the city’s defenders to withdraw. Despite some recent success, Russia’s progress in the campaign has been grindingly slow and both sides have sustained heavy casualties.', 'But since capturing Soledar earlier this month, Russian forces have stepped up shelling of the villages just to the west of it, including Blahodatne.', 'Many civilians have followed a directive from the government in Kyiv to leave Donetsk, which is home to Bakhmut and one of the two areas that make up the Donbas region. Civilians who have stayed remain vulnerable to shelling and artillery attacks, with dozens killed in recent weeks.

On Sunday, shelling there killed at least three people and wounded six others including a nurse, according to the regional military administration. ', '“Today, the Russian army has been shelling Kherson atrociously all day,” Mr. Zelensky said in his nightly address. “Residential buildings, various social and transport facilities, including a hospital, post office, and bus station, have been damaged. Two women, nurses, were wounded in the hospital. As of now, there are reports of six wounded and three dead.”', 'Russian forces have shelled Kherson on a near daily basis following their retreat from the city in November.

Late Sunday, the regional governor said a Russian missile strike on the city had killed at least one person and injured three.', 'There have been signs that Russian forces are regrouping for a possible new offensive that could once again threaten Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials have said that а Russian tank division that had been deployed in Belarus had been diverted, possibly as part of a buildup of forces that could once again push into the Kharkiv region.', 'But the Kremlin has set full control of the Donbas, where it has held considerable ground since 2014, as its immediate military objective. To that end it has mobilized tens of thousands of new recruits, though it has failed to achieve sweeping territorial gains in the region in recent months.', 'Military authorities in Ukraine say that Moscow’s advances in the Donbas region have come at the expense of heavy casualties, not least among the ranks of the Wagner private military company. Some analysts of the conflict say that Wagner’s failure to secure Bakhmut, even after months of fighting, has dimmed its star in some Russian military circles.', 'The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a report on Saturday that conventional Russian forces were “likely replacing exhausted” Wagner forces “to maintain the offensive in Bakhmut” after the capture of Soledar.', 'But Russia might be less willing to sustain heavy losses among regular conscripts than among Wagner fighters, the report said. “The Russians’ ability to execute large-scale rapid offensives on multiple axes this winter and spring is thus very questionable,” the report said.']"

Anything less would not have sufficed against Elena Rybakina in their gripping, corner-to-corner final that might have been better suited to a ring as the two six-footers exchanged big blows for two hours and 28 minutes.', 'Mash tennis. Crush tennis. Rip tennis. Smack tennis. Take your pick, but something onomatopoeic seemed appropriate with all that power on display, and what separated this match from many a tennis slugfest was the consistent depth and quality of the punching.', 'High risk was rewarded repeatedly on Saturday as both finalists took big swings, aiming close to the lines and often hitting them.', 'Rybakina finished with 31 winners to 25 unforced errors. Sabalenka, in what looked like the finest performance of her career, finished with 51 winners to 28 unforced errors: She cranked up the quality after an erratic opening set and won the lion’s share of the rallies, or maybe the tiger’s share, considering she had the animal tattooed on her left forearm at age 18 to remind her to fight for every point.', '“My parents didn’t know about this tattoo,” she told the Tennis Channel. “When they saw it the first time, my dad was laughing, I don’t know why, but my mom didn’t talk to me for one week.”', 'Five years later, the tattoo remains but much has changed: Her father, Sergey, died in 2019 at age 43, leaving Sabalenka committed to achieving the dream he had for her to become No. 1.', 'She has already fulfilled his wish in doubles, reaching the top spot in 2021. When the new singles rankings are released on Monday, she will be back at No. 2, behind Iga Swiatek, who still has a large lead based on her terrific 2022 season but who has lost to Sabalenka and Rybakina in the last two significant tournaments.', 'Sabalenka defeated her in November in the semifinals of the WTA Finals, the season-ending tour championships in Fort Worth. Rybakina overpowered Swiatek in the fourth round in Melbourne on her way to the final.', 'Swiatek, the Polish star who looked set to become a dominant No. 1, is instead struggling to adjust to her new status and facing increased competition at the top, although she remains, until proven otherwise, the best women’s clay-court player.', 'But on other surfaces, Sabalenka and Rybakina, last year’s surprise Wimbledon champion, clearly pose a formidable threat with their aggressive returns, relatively flat groundstrokes and penetrating serves.', 'There were rare variations on Saturday: a drop-shot winner from Rybakina, a few defensive lobs and the occasional off-speed backhand. But for the most part, it was strength versus strength; straight-line power against straight-line power. The spectacle was frequently breathtaking, but you did not have to hold your breath for more than a few seconds: The longest rally was 13 strokes, and the average rally length was just 3.28 strokes.', 'It was tennis reminiscent of the big-serving, high-velocity duels between Serena and Venus Williams. It was also a significant departure from last year’s Australian Open, where Ashleigh Barty ended a 44-year singles drought for the host country by winning the title, putting her court craft and crisply sliced one-handed backhand to work before shocking the tennis world (and Australia) by retiring in March at age 25.', 'But Barty, now married to Garry Kissick and expecting their first child, has hardly avoided the Australian Open, making numerous public appearances this year and walking onto Rod Laver Arena before Saturday’s final with the Akhurst Memorial Cup in hand.', '“I can honestly look myself in the mirror and say I gave everything to tennis, but it gave me back so much more in return,” she said in a recent interview. “And all that really starts from the people I was surrounded with. So much of my success is our success. It genuinely is.”', 'Sabalenka could relate to that on Saturday as she shared a post-victory moment with her team and then watched from afar as her normally stoic coach, Anton Dubrov, put a white towel to his face and sobbed in the player box.', 'Sabalenka said she had never seen Dubrov cry and explained that last season, in February, as she struggled with the yips on her second serve and her confidence and reached a point where she could not even openly discuss the problem, Dubrov offered his resignation.', '“There were moments last year when he said, ‘I think I’m done, and I think I cannot give you something else, and you have to find someone else,’” Sabalenka said in an interview with Nine Network. “And I said: ‘No, you’re not right. It’s not about you. We just have to work through these tough moments, and we’ll come back stronger.’”', 'Her performance on Saturday was incontrovertible proof that they had succeeded, with the help of a biomechanical expert but also Sabalenka’s own resilience. She is 11-0 this year and though she double-faulted seven times in the final, including on her first match point, she also repeatedly shrugged off any jitters (and the palpable concern of the big crowd) and came up with aces or service winners on subsequent serves.', 'In the end, she hit 17 aces to Rybakina’s 9.', '“For sure, it’s not easy mentally,” Rybakina said of Sabalenka. “She didn’t have a great serve last year, but now she was super strong and she served well. For sure, I respect that. I know how much work it takes.”', 'Rybakina has paid her dues, too. Born and raised in Russia, she switched allegiance to Kazakhstan in exchange for financial support in 2018. And though she was allowed to play at Wimbledon last year, her victory, with her strong Russian connections, was not the outcome the tournament was seeking either when it imposed its ban under pressure from the British government.', 'Some Ukrainian players continue to oppose Russians and Belarusians being allowed to compete at all on tour, even as neutrals. The debate is about to intensify as the International Olympic Committee begins to push for Russians and Belarusians to be allowed to compete as independent athletes at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris — a move the Ukrainian government strongly opposes and could respond to by withdrawing its own athletes.', 'But Sabalenka, after sitting out Wimbledon, where she reached the semifinals in 2021, is now a Grand Slam singles champion in Australia and was feted with no apparent ambivalence by the Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, and was awarded her trophy in Rod Laver Arena by Billie Jean King.', 'Sabalenka’s news conference was full of questions intended not to confront her directly but rather to probe the issue. However you present her on the scoreboard, it was a Belarus victory.', '“Missing the Wimbledon was really tough for me,” she said. “It was a tough moment for me. But I played the U.S. Open after.

Jones, the national security expert, argues in his book “Three Dangerous Men.”', 'As a result, Russia’s military gained expertise in subterfuge and clandestine tactics, like sending Russian Spetsnaz special forces units, without insignia, to Crimea before Russia illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014.', 'But the war in Ukraine has required a different kind of maneuvering: offensive campaigns by large numbers of ground forces operating in different areas with the goal of seizing land. There, General Gerasimov has been ineffective.', 'The troops sent to take Kyiv in the early days of the war lacked even basic supplies and soon stalled outside the city. He did not hone the military’s ability to move large numbers of different kinds of troops, by land, air and sea, yet his invasion plan depended on that. Russian forces got bogged down, and then eviscerated, in northern Ukrainian cities and towns.', 'General Gerasimov himself almost fell victim to his military’s poor planning when, in late April, he narrowly escaped being killed in a Ukrainian strike when he visited troops. Dozens of Russians were killed instead, in an incident that prompted Moscow to scale back visits from leaders to the front.', '“This goes to the lack of serious training and operational experience in the Russian Ministry of Defense,” said Frederick Hodges, a retired lieutenant general and former top U.S. Army commander in Europe. “When you get into a real war, like the one in Ukraine, all their shortcomings are immediately exposed.”', 'The result of those shortcomings was on display last November in a scene broadcast on Russian state television. Standing in front of a map and a Russian flag, and wearing army fatigues, General Surovikin announced Russia’s retreat from the southern city of Kherson, calling it a “difficult” decision.', '“Having assessed the situation, I propose to take up defense on the left bank of the Dnipro,” he told his superiors, in a reference to the river that offered the sole remaining escape route.', 'Missing from the scripted televised meeting was Mr. Putin — an absence, American and NATO officials said, that reflected his desire to distance himself from what was by any account a stunning military defeat.', 'Just a month earlier, General Surovikin had been appointed to lead the Ukraine effort, replacing Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov.', 'But General Surovikin, according to American military officials and Biden administration officials, had solidified a shaky Russian position in Ukraine, particularly in the south. He had pushed for Russian forces to abandon Kherson and conducted a retreat that minimized Russian casualties. He then focused his forces on what the U.S. military calls “defense in depth,” building secondary trench lines.', 'While his defensive moves raised worries in Washington that Russia might be able to withstand renewed Ukrainian offensives, Russian military bloggers had a far different reaction.', 'The bloggers, who have emerged as an influential voice during the conflict, criticized the Russian military command for the retreat from Kherson. Mr. Putin had been uncomfortable with that plan, initially rejecting General Surovikin’s recommendation to pull back. U.S. and allied officials believe that General Gerasimov and Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, used Mr. Putin’s skepticism of the defensive stance against General Surovikin.', 'American officials predicted in December that General Gerasimov and Mr. Shoigu would try to reassert their control over the military amid intense jockeying for Mr. Putin’s ear. In January, the two made their move, engineering a field demotion for General Surovikin.', 'The officials say that General Gerasimov and Mr. Shoigu attacked General Surovikin’s defensive posture and proposed a return to the “hyper offensive,” with a potential initial goal of taking Kramatorsk, in the east. Russian-controlled separatists initially took the city in 2014 but were driven out by Ukrainian forces during an earlier phase of the war.', 'In another sign of a broader shake-up, Gen. Col. Mikhail Teplinsky has probably been dismissed as one of Russia’s key operational commanders in Ukraine, according to a British defense intelligence assessment this week.', '“Teplinsky was the officer on the ground in charge of Russia’s relatively successful withdrawal from west of the Dnipro in November 2022, and he has received praise in Russia as a capable and pragmatic commander,” the assessment said.', 'Promoting General Gerasimov, U.S. and other Western military officials say, was intended to both deflect criticism of the war effort from the military bloggers and to check the rising power of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the mercenary group Wagner that has spearheaded the bloody Russian offensive at Bakhmut in the Donbas. Mr. Prigozhin has also been a staunch supporter of General Surovikin.', '“The recent shake-up in commanders of the war effort seems like the result of political infighting and cronyism,” said Dara Massicot, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation in Washington.', 'With Mr. Putin still insisting that Russia will seize the Donbas and even Kyiv, expectations are rising that General Gerasimov will be under immense pressure to carry out a successful offensive this spring, military officials and analysts say.', '“It’s now on him, and I suspect Putin has unrealistic expectations again,” Mark Galeotti, who studies Russian security affairs, said in a Twitter message, calling General Gerasimov’s promotion “the most poisoned of chalices.”']"

Barnes', 'Eric Schmitt']",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/us/politics/tanks-ukraine.html,Tanks Alone Won’t Turn the Tide of the War in Ukraine,The United States will have to step up its training program to ensure the Ukrainian military can use all the Western-provided equipment effectively.,"['WASHINGTON — For all the fanfare about the advanced battle tanks Ukraine secured from the West this week, they won’t be the silver bullet that allows Kyiv to win the war. Instead, the United States military will, once again, attempt to remake an army in its own image to give Ukraine the best chance to break through entrenched Russian defenses.', 'To do that the United States and its allies will not just have to provide the newly promised tanks, armored vehicles and advanced munitions, but also expand what has been something of an ad hoc training program to teach Ukraine’s military to use all the new equipment together. It will be a crash course in what the U.S. military calls combined arms warfare, something that takes months if not years for American units to master.', 'Decisions about new military aid are a delicate balancing act for the White House and the NATO alliance: While they want to provide Kyiv with new capabilities that have the potential to break through a battlefield stalemate, they also don’t want to provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into escalating the fight into a wider war.', 'As a result, providing the Western tanks produced considerable hand-wringing. But so far Moscow has been deterred from expanding the war, and creating newer and stronger Ukrainian units represents the best chance of avoiding a stalemate.', 'As satellite imagery revealed Russians building primary and secondary lines of defensive trenches along the front lines, American government analysts began the year forecasting a deadly stalemate as the likely outcome for 2023. Worried that a frozen conflict favors Russia, the United States and its allies began more earnest discussions in recent weeks about how to change the battlefield dynamics in Ukraine’s favor.', '“We want to put them in the best possible position so that whether this war ends on the battlefield, whether it ends with the diplomacy or some combination, that they are sitting on a map that is far more advantageous for their long-term future and that Putin feels the strategic failure,” Victoria Nuland, a senior State Department official, told the Senate on Thursday.', 'Much of the first year of the conflict has involved Russia and Ukraine pounding each other’s positions with artillery, but there have been some tank operations. Ukraine’s biggest success, its counteroffensive outside Kharkiv, used tanks, but some of the most important weaponry were the quick-moving armored fighting vehicles. There, Ukraine also faced disorganized Russian forces.', 'But in the next phase of the war, the Ukrainian military will target those dug-in trench lines of Russian units. Breaking through those lines is not just about driving a battalion of tanks over the trenches. It requires a coordinated attack with infantry troops marking targets, tanks firing at those positions and artillery guns providing cover and support. Such combined arms maneuvers are the backbone of U.S. military combat operations and the focus of the U.S. Army’s most intense training.', 'Though tanks have been the focus of attention, military analysts say a critical part of the recent donations by the West may be the 109 Bradley Fighting Vehicles the United States is sending and the large numbers of artillery guns that European allies will send. This equipment is likely to be combined with the German Leopards to help create new Ukrainian armored units. When the full package of Western equipment arrives, Kyiv could create as many as three additional brigades.', '“The most important parts of the package are armored fighting vehicles, artillery, and precision-guided munitions,” said Michael Kofman, the Russia expert at CNA, a Washington analytic organization. “The small numbers of tanks promised are the least significant part of this.”', 'To ensure Ukraine’s army can conduct such maneuvers will involve an increase in American and European training. For months, the United States avoided sending Ukraine complex new systems that require new training. That attitude has shifted — first when the United States sent American artillery, then longer-range missile systems, and most recently, the Patriot battery system, all of which required training outside Ukraine.', 'The initial hesitancy was in part because of concerns about taking experienced Ukrainian soldiers off the battlefield as well as worries that having the United States train Ukrainian soldiers could be seen by the Kremlin as a provocation. But with training on Patriot missile defense systems underway in Oklahoma and instruction on intensive maneuver warfare underway at America’s training ground in Germany, the original concerns have faded, U.S. military officials have acknowledged.', 'This isn’t the first time the United States has done this kind of training. The United States tried, and failed, to teach such techniques to the Iraqi army and, to a lesser degree, the Afghan military. But Ukraine has proved itself time and time again to be technically capable and resourceful — and its army has shown itself extremely motivated to learn how to employ new equipment.', '“Ukrainians have a core professional army group that has been fighting the Russians for years and years and years and received Western training until 2022,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor at Columbia University. “They are not starting from scratch.”', 'Just how realistic it might be for the Pentagon to train the Ukrainians in the complexities of combined arms maneuver warfare in a short time span remains to be seen. Even in peacetime it takes a while for American units to master such operations, and that’s with the luxury of expansive training areas and deep institutional knowledge. Still, new warfare techniques can be learned under fire. After all, the American army first learned modern combined arms techniques in the midst of World War II.', '“Militaries that are properly motivated and have the right kind of command structure adapt and learn pretty quickly,” Dr. Biddle said. “There is this view out there that militaries never change. And that’s nonsense. They can change really fast when they’re motivated and they’re organized correctly.”', 'Some analysts believe the single most effective weapon the United States could give Ukraine is precision-guided missiles. Ukraine’s army, by training and tradition, focuses on artillery. It is that expertise that allowed them to quickly and effectively use the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, to strike Russian ammunition depots and command posts.', 'Russia has adjusted, pulling back its logistics hubs outside the range of the HIMARS. A more advanced, longer-range missile, like the ATACMS, could hit those targets. But for now, weapons that could strike deep into Russia are off the table, seen as far too likely to provoke Mr. Putin. Though the United States has steadily opened up to providing Ukraine with more powerful weaponry over the course of the conflict, it has remained resolute on this one point.', 'American officials acknowledged that the true power of the 31 Abrams tanks the United States announced on Wednesday it would send Ukraine is that they will unlock more donations of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, as well as more artillery and infantry fighting vehicles.', 'The U.S. provision of the tanks will “spur the Germans and inspire the Poles” while demonstrating NATO unity, said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. In addition to the 112 Leopards Germany will send, Poland has pledged 14 (along with hundreds of older tanks) and Canada will send four. Norway said it will send some of the tanks and Spain is considering a donation.', 'The new donations alone are unlikely to boost combat power enough to win the war for Ukraine, but officials and outside analysts say they will help substantially.', 'The tanks will punch through the trench lines and open a path for infantry in Bradley Fighting Vehicles to hold the reclaimed territory.', 'And the tanks send important signals to both Ukraine and Russia about continued American support. For Russia, the tanks demonstrate that the flow of arms from the West is growing, not waning. And for Ukraine it is a big morale boost, said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former American intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security.', '“It’s a vote of confidence that people are still invested in Ukraine retaking its territory rather than pushing Ukraine to negotiate,” she said.']"

Sanger', 'Eric Schmitt', 'Helene Cooper']",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/biden-abrams-tanks-ukraine-russia.html,How Biden Reluctantly Agreed to Send Tanks to Ukraine,The decision unlocked a flow of heavy arms from Europe and inched the United States and its NATO allies closer to direct conflict with Russia.,"['WASHINGTON — President Biden’s announcement Wednesday that he would send M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations with the chancellor of Germany and other European leaders, who insisted that the only way to unlock a flow of heavy European arms was for the United States to send tanks of its own.', 'His decision, however reluctant, now paves the way for German-made Leopard 2 tanks to be delivered to Ukraine in two or three months, provided by several European nations. While it is unclear whether it will make a decisive difference in the spring offensive that President Volodymyr Zelensky is now planning to take back territory seized by Russia, it is the latest in a series of gradual escalations that has inched the United States and its NATO allies closer to direct conflict with Russia.', 'In interviews, European and American officials acknowledged that three months ago, it would have been inconceivable that Mr. Biden, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and leaders of other European nations would have contributed such heavy arms. But over time, they argued, the battlefield has changed and they believed the threat that President Vladimir V. Putin would reach for a tactical nuclear weapon to eviscerate Ukrainian forces has diminished.', 'Moreover, they said, they wanted to demonstrate to Mr. Putin that his bet that European unity would fracture over the winter had failed, and that NATO remained committed to the war even in the face of gas and oil cutoffs and fears that Russian cyberattacks would cripple European infrastructure.', '“Putin expected Europe and the United States to weaken our resolve,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, flanked by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and his defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III. He added, “These tanks are further evidence of our enduring, unflagging commitment to Ukraine and our confidence in the skill of Ukrainian forces.”', 'Only last week, Mr. Austin dismissed the idea of sending the Abrams tank, with his aides saying its long tail of supply and repair vehicles\xa0was too complex for the stretched Ukrainian forces to operate.', 'The No. 3 official in the Pentagon, Colin H. Kahl, said last week that “The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment,” adding, “we should not be providing the Ukrainians systems they can’t repair, they can’t sustain, and that they, over the long term, can’t afford, because it’s not helpful.”', 'But by promising Abrams tanks — which John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said would take “many months” to be built by General Dynamics — Mr. Biden was able to give Mr. Scholz political cover to send Leopard tanks by early spring. And Germany’s decision opened the way for Spain, Poland and Finland to do the same, with Norway likely next to announce a similar contribution.', 'But Mr. Biden was clearly sensitive to the suggestion that he had been forced into the decision by one of his closest allies. He cast the\xa0issue as one of preserving unity. “We wanted to make sure we were all together,” Mr. Biden said.', 'The European Leopards, though they come in many versions that use different types of ammunition, are considered lighter and more agile than the Abrams tanks and better suited to the coming counteroffensive. That will require Ukrainian forces to breach lines of Russian-dug trenches, a situation more akin to World War I battlefields in Europe — for which the tank was invented.', 'Mr. Biden often says he has two goals: to liberate Ukraine and to avoid direct conflict between American and Russian forces. Increasingly, those two goals are in tension. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden insisted that the new firepower was intended to defend Ukrainian territory, and nothing more.', '“There is no offensive threat to Russia,” he said. “If Russian troops return to Russia, where they belong, this war would be over today.”', 'The Russians viewed it differently, to no one’s surprise. The Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, spent much of the day on social media suggesting a broader American plot, saying “it is all about U.S. ‘proxy-war’ with our country.”', 'Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Scholz were worried about the proxy-war imagery, though for different reasons. Mr. Biden worries about escalation; in private conversations, Mr. Scholz made the case that even eight decades after World War II, European nations would be uncomfortable seeing German tanks rumbling into battle — even in the cause of liberating Ukrainian territory.', 'After a call last week with Mr. Scholz, who is still finding his footing as the leader of Western Europe’s biggest power, Mr. Biden began to relent. He told the Pentagon to set aside its many objections that the Abrams tank was ill suited to Ukraine’s needs, and far too hard to operate and maintain for its stressed forces.', 'It was a triumph of political calculation over logistical concerns. It made no sense to the Pentagon to go through the logistical headaches of sending the country’s most advanced tanks to Ukraine when there were very capable German Leopard tanks nearby that could get to Ukraine faster, and operate more efficiently.', 'On top of that, several European countries, including Spain, Poland and Finland, were willing to send their German Leopard tanks if Germany would only agree — a legal requirement that came with their original acquisition of their German-made equipment.', 'In senior Biden administration meetings, Mr. Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, laid out the Pentagon position. In subsequent interviews, White House national security officials dutifully repeated the military talking points about why the Abrams did not make sense, while European tanks did.', 'But Mr. Austin and General Milley are charged with giving Mr. Biden their best military advice; in this case it clashed with the need to preserve unity among the allies. What the Pentagon was not taking into enough account, one official said, was the intense fear among European governments of doing anything to provoke Russia without having the cover of the United States doing the same thing first.', '“Like it or not, that means the United States remains the glue that holds NATO and Europe together,” said Peter Juul, a national security analyst in the newsletter The Liberal Patriot.', 'At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Mr. Scholz was clear, according to several people who heard him, that he would not agree to send Leopard tanks until the United States agreed to send its Abrams. American officials at first thought he could be persuaded otherwise, and hoped that a commitment by Britain to send Challenger 2 tanks — which have different operational requirements — would move him to do the same.', 'It did not, as German officials made clear to Mr. Austin and General Milley during a meeting on Friday of more than 50 allies at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.', 'After the meeting failed to produce Germany’s approval to deploy its tanks, the ensuing media reports pointed to the division as the biggest crack in NATO unity since the start of the Ukraine War.', 'Some European officials argue that the split was overblown, and that the tanks are less likely to provide a game-changing difference in the coming offensives. Missile defenses and precision-guided rockets, like the HIMARS system the United States has sent to Ukraine, are more effective, they argue.', 'But as often happens, the tanks — a weapon easy for anyone to understand, resonant of wars past — became a litmus test. And after a year of using NATO unity as one of the Biden administration’s key talking points about Russian failures in the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials realized that it was time for politics to trump the Pentagon’s objections.', '“It seems that the issue all along has been a political, not military one,” said Evelyn Farkas, the Pentagon’s senior official for Ukraine in the Obama administration. “And our military leaders should have greenlighted the Abrams long ago to provide reinforcement to the Germans that collective security would prevail.”', '“What is stunning about it is how afraid our allies are about facing Russia without the United States,” she added.', 'Mr. Austin himself arrived at that conclusion after the meeting in Germany ended without a decision on the German tanks, according to aides, telling associates that he did not see the sense of risking a “fracture” in NATO or a rift with Germany over the issue.', 'Some Pentagon officials were taken aback that German officials were publicly admitting the link between the Abrams tanks and the Leopards, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He added that officials had thought those communications would only be internal.', 'By Monday, officials said both Mr. Austin and General Milley were onboard with sending American tanks to Germany. To make the point — or to be seen making the point — Mr. Austin called Mr. Biden on Monday to recommend sending the Abrams tanks.', 'While some lawmakers had suggested the United States needed to send as few as a single Abrams tank to unlock the German Leopards, the Pentagon leaders said that made no sense. If the United States was going to send its most advanced tank system, it should send a battalion with “combat power,” one official said.', 'A Ukrainian battalion has 31 tanks, so that was the amount the United States agreed to send, Pentagon officials said.', 'Several details still need to be worked out. The Army has not yet decided which specific type of Abrams tanks it will deliver, Douglas R. Bush, an Army assistant secretary, told reporters on Wednesday.', 'The Army has tanks in its inventory that might need to be revamped — but they will not need to be built from scratch by General Dynamics. The Army has more than 1,000 Abrams tanks either ready to fight or in various states of partial construction that could be retrofitted for use in Ukraine.', 'The Army must decide between variants of the Abrams tanks that have different electronics and a different gun turret, Mr. Bush said, a decision to be made by senior Pentagon officials in the coming weeks.', 'Procuring the tanks will take months, officials said, giving the U.S. military time to train Ukrainian soldiers how to operate and maintain them. It was unclear whether training would take place in Germany, the United States or both, Pentagon officials said on Wednesday.']"

Sergei Cherevaty, said that the retreat had been ordered “to preserve our personnel.”', 'With winter set in, fighting in Ukraine has slowed considerably, and many of the decisions being made by Ukrainian officials and their allies now are based on the belief that as spring begins, so will a new phase in the war.', 'The tanks promised on Wednesday by Berlin and Washington will not be delivered in time to help Ukraine defend towns and cities near Bakhmut, where Russian forces have recently advanced in a grueling ground assault.', 'Indeed, it may be months before they are deployed.', 'Moving them into the conflict zone is far from an easy task, and Ukrainian troops still need to be trained to use the powerful Western war machines.

Neither came back.,,"['Two British citizens, Andrew Bagshaw and Chris Parry, departed from the city of Kramatorsk at 8 a.m. on Jan. 6 and headed east toward the front lines of Ukraine’s war with Russia, Ukrainian police said.', 'Their mission, according to an aid worker familiar with the matter, was to evacuate an elderly woman in Soledar, a small town where Russian and Ukrainian forces were waging a vicious fight.', 'They never returned.', 'Questions lingered about their fate until Tuesday,\xa0when Mr. Parry’s family confirmed in a statement released through the British foreign ministry that “our beloved Chrissy” and Mr.\xa0Bagshaw had been killed “whilst attempting a humanitarian evacuation from Soledar.”', '“His selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged there has made us and his larger family extremely proud,” the statement said.', 'The men’s vehicle is believed to have been hit by an artillery shell, though investigations were underway, Mr. Bagshaw’s parents said at a news conference. They had feared such an outcome, they said, but were “very, very proud” of his work.', 'Mr. Bagshaw, 47, and Mr. Parry, 28, were part of an ad hoc cohort of foreigners with little to no combat experience who helped evacuate civilians from the front lines, acquaintances said. Several of Mr. Parry’s and Mr. Bagshaw’s evacuations were documented by journalists, including Arnaud De Decker, who shared footage of Mr. Parry in Bakhmut days before he went missing.', 'Their deaths were a stark reminder of the danger facing those whose work has become a lifeline in the Donbas, where many Ukrainians are trapped in some of the worst war zones Europe has seen since the Second World War.', 'On Jan. 6, the two men “went to some really dangerous address,” said Grzegorz Rybak, a fellow foreign volunteer who worked with both men and lived with Mr. Bagshaw in Kramatorsk for two weeks. “And they did not come back.”', 'PMC Wagner, a notorious mercenary group fighting on behalf of Russia, claimed a week after their disappearance to have found one of the men’s bodies. The group posted photos on Telegram of what appeared to be their passports, along with a certificate identifying Mr. Parry as a volunteer with the Pavlo Vyshniakov Foundation, a Kyiv-based charity that sends resources including food and medical supplies to civilians, hospitals and military groups. The foundation declined to comment.', 'Wagner’s claim could not be verified at the time, and Russian state media has since claimed, without evidence, that the men were mercenaries.', 'The war in Ukraine is a humanitarian quandary. Conditions in some areas are too perilous for residents to stay put, or for many international organizations to allow their staff to venture in, said Abby Stoddard, a humanitarian policy analyst.', 'So some of the riskiest evacuations are being carried out by independent volunteers — “in other words, the ones who have the least amount of resources to keep people safe,” Ms. Stoddard said.', 'Bryan Stern, a U.S. veteran who co-founded a humanitarian rescue operation, described front line evacuation efforts in Ukraine as a “free-for-all.” While foreign volunteers came to Ukraine with good intentions, he said, most have “no idea what they’re doing.”', '“This is really why this is a sad story,” he said.', 'Mr. Parry was a software engineer who wanted to travel the world, his family said.', 'In early January, he told the local BBC station in Cornwall, where he grew up, that he “knew nothing” about Ukraine before the invasion but “became obsessed” with helping. He intended to enlist with foreign fighters, but, having no combat experience, instead bought a van and began working as an evacuation driver last March.', 'In an Instagram post made days after his arrival, Mr. Parry wrote that he felt apprehensive about a planned journey to Kharkiv because “everyone I have spoken to about it believes there’s a very strong chance of me dying.”', 'Mr. Bagshaw was a British genetics researcher who was between jobs last spring in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he decided to go to Ukraine, a photojournalist who met him wrote in the New Zealand Herald in October. His family told reporters that he believed “it to be the morally right thing to do.” ', 'Mr. Rybak, who translated for the volunteers, said their ad hoc operation was largely carried out by a small community of English-speakers in Kramatorsk. Neither Mr. Parry nor Mr. Bagshaw spoke Ukrainian or Russian, he said.', 'Mr. Rybak said Ukrainians would contact local aid workers about relatives near Bakhmut, and their addresses would be relayed to the volunteers, who would drive into the conflict zone to evacuate them, often in donated or crowd-funded vehicles. The trips were unpredictable, Mr. Rybak said, with addresses sometimes vacant or residents resisting evacuation.', 'The men had plans for after the war. Mr. Parry had a partner he wanted to marry, Mr. Rybak recalled, and Mr. Bagshaw wanted to carry on with his scientific career.', '“They wanted to live,” he said. ']"

But it may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.', '“These can help Ukraine to defend itself, win and prevail as an independent nation,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general. “Soon to be a regular sight prowling the fields of Ukraine,” Britain’s Defense Ministry crowed in a Twitter post with a photo of a German Leopard 2 tank and a British-made Challenger 2 tank chewing up a muddy training field in Poland.', 'But not that soon. Ukrainian troops still need to be trained to use the powerful Western war machines, and moving them into the conflict zone is far from an easy task. The tanks that were promised by Berlin and Washington will not be delivered until spring or summer at the earliest — not in time to help Ukraine defend hotly contested towns and cities near Bakhmut, in the country’s east, where Russian forces have been recently advancing in a grueling ground assault.', 'The more immediate payoff from the announcements on Wednesday may be in providing a pathway for about a dozen other European countries to donate their own German-made Leopard 2s to Ukraine — a step that would not have been taken without Berlin’s consent and a parallel promise by Washington to contribute its M1 Abrams tanks.', '“Sending the Abrams appears to have been the key to unlocking the Leopards, which will probably get to Ukraine much faster,” said Sophia Besch, an expert on European defense issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.', 'Here is a look at what happens next.', 'The biggest donation is coming from the United States — 31 M1 Abrams, enough to supply one Ukrainian military battalion. The Abrams is one of the most sophisticated tank systems in the world, but it requires specific training, technology for its parts and generally on specialized fuels to keep it running dependably. On Wednesday, American officials said it would be at least months before the Abrams could be delivered — and would not elaborate — although other experts said it could take at least a year.', 'Britain, Germany and Poland have each committed to sending 14 tanks, with London predicting delivery of its Challenger 2s within weeks. Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, forecast it would take Berlin three or four months to ship its Leopard 2 tanks.', 'Poland has signaled it is already prepared to send its own Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Portugal has said it could give four Leopard 2s, and Norway has said it could send eight more. Other pledges to give Leopard 2s — but without specifying how many — have been made by Spain, Finland and the Netherlands. And France is considering giving Ukraine an unspecified number of its Leclerc battle tanks.', 'Additionally, Denmark has said it could send 20 Swiss-made Piranha tanks to Ukraine once the government in Bern agrees they could be re-exported — a process that moved forward last weekend after being stalled for months.', 'In all, that means at least 105 Western tanks have been committed — in principle at least.', 'Ukrainian military officials have long said they need at least 300 Western tanks to make a difference in the war. That “is a lot of tanks at the national level,” according to an analysis on Wednesday by Janes, the London-based intelligence firm.', 'European militaries are holding at least 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks — and hundreds of other kinds of Western battle tanks. The Russians also have thousands of tanks still available in what has become a war of rapid attrition, said David Silbey, a military historian at Cornell University who specializes in battlefield analysis.', '“The West will never manage a one-to-one match for those numbers,” Mr. Silbey said. “But, given the quality advantage of the Leopard or Abrams over even the most modern Russian tank, if the West could supply 500 to 1,000 tanks, it would make a massive difference to the Ukrainians and to the war.”', 'Some will be arriving in British training camps in the coming days to start training on the Challenger 2 tanks that London committed to this month, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.', 'Some former military officials and experts have challenged claims — mostly by the United States — that it could take months to train Ukraine’s forces to use the tanks. They note that the Ukrainian troops selected to crew them will have already been trained on Soviet-era tanks. So learning to operate the Leopard 2 tanks, which run on diesel fuel and are easier to operate than M1 Abrams, could take only three to four weeks “to achieve a basic proficiency,” the International Institute for Strategic Studies said this month.', 'American officials, who briefed journalists on condition of anonymity on Wednesday, described a far more complicated process for the M1 Abrams, involving training not just for operating the tanks, but also for maintaining them. Part of that process will involve building a stable supply chain to ensure the tanks are getting the fuel, parts and other assistance they would need on the front lines.', 'While the Abrams may not arrive on the battlefield for what one U.S. official described as “some time,” training Ukrainian troops to use them will begin quickly. Already, American troops in Germany are training Ukrainian forces on a range of combined and coordinated weapons, including armored combat vehicles.', 'Dwindling supplies of ammunition have been a bane for Ukraine’s forces almost since the start of the war, reliant as they are on diminishing stores of munitions that fit their Soviet-era tanks and other weapons. Captured Russian tanks have been an essential stop gap for Ukraine, but spare parts for them are often hard to acquire, according to Ukrainian soldiers.', 'The Western-made tanks use ammunition that is compatible with NATO stocks, meaning that they could be replenished by any of the 30 member states of the military alliance or their partners. The tanks will be delivered with some extra ammunition supplies. Still, the war has so drained Western stockpiles that some allies are growing nervous about whether they will have enough for other potential conflicts or even their own self-defense.', 'While the new Western tanks are essential for any future Ukrainian offensive operations, they may prove a headache for Ukraine’s legions of supply officers. The German and American tanks have different parts and maintenance regimes, and both fire types of ammunition different from those of the Soviet-era tanks that Ukraine currently fields.', 'The process of delivering Western weapons and other military equipment to Ukraine has been one of the most heavily guarded secrets of the war.', 'Concerns that Russia will target roads, railways or staging grounds for the matériel has required what officials and experts described as stealthy convoys, usually disguised or cloaked in darkness, to evade attack. Former Western military officials and experts described a patchwork of delivery routes, largely originating from hubs in Poland, Slovakia and Germany, that will be crucial to getting tanks, armored fighting vehicles and huge guns to the front line.', 'Most of the weapons will be shipped either on rail cars or flatbed trucks that are strong enough to carry their huge weight. Rail is generally the fastest and safest way to move armor, experts said, given that long convoys of flatbed trucks would most likely attract Russia’s attention. It would take too much time, fuel and spare parts to drive the tanks and other armored vehicles to the battlefield, experts said. They would also become, in essence, a moving target for Russian warplanes.', 'The risks are so daunting — and worries over provoking Russia are so high — that, instead of Western forces or contractors delivering them to the conflict zone, Ukrainian troops are required to retrieve the weapons from depots in NATO territory.']"

According to the ministry, the Spanish authorities believe that the arrested man, a Spanish citizen, made and sent all of the six letter bombs himself, though the “participation or influence of other people” was not ruled out.', 'The ministry did not name the man who was detained, providing only his initials, P.G.P. The statement described him as retired, “very active” on social networks and having “technical and computer knowledge.”', 'The letter bombs were all sent from the northeastern Spanish city of Burgos, the main city in the Burgos region, the statement said. The man was arrested in a town in that province, and the authorities were conducting a search of the man’s home, where investigators believe he made the explosive devices, the ministry said.', 'It was not immediately clear from the statement whether the man had been formally charged.', 'Six letter bombs were sent in late November and early December to sites mostly in Madrid, including Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s official residence, which also serves as his office; the two embassies; and the Spanish Defense Ministry.', 'No one was killed in the attacks, which U.S. officials have described as terrorism. An employee of the Ukrainian Embassy was injured when one of the packages exploded.', 'One of the letter bombs was also sent to Instalaza, a weapons manufacturer in Zaragoza, in northeastern Spain. Instalaza makes grenade launchers provided to Ukraine by the Spanish government.', 'Investigators had focused in recent weeks on the Russian Imperial Movement, a group that has members and associates across Europe, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities around the inquiry.', 'The officials added that the group, which has been designated a global terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, is believed to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies.', 'The apparent aim of the action, according to the U.S. officials, was to signal that Russia and its proxies could carry out terrorist strikes across Europe, including in the capitals of member states of NATO, which is helping defend Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Spain is a member of the alliance and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as diplomatic support.']"

The German publication Der Spiegel and other news outlets reported on Tuesday that Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany had agreed, after months of resisting, to supply the coveted Leopard 2 tank to Ukraine, possibly in conjunction with the United States sending its M1 Abrams tank.

Few are more sensitive to this than Mr. Zelensky, who appears almost daily on video calls with foreign leaders and legislatures dressed in a drab green military shirt, always asking for the same thing: more weapons.', 'Russia is gearing up for a new offensive expected in the spring or earlier, and the Ukrainians say they need hundreds of tanks and other armored vehicles to counter Moscow’s forces and launch their own offensives to drive Russians from occupied territory.', 'There was no sign that the Ukrainian army’s food procurement scandal involved the misappropriation of Western military assistance, or would affect Ukraine’s ability to fight the Russian invasion. But the removal of the officials, coming amid almost daily pleas from Ukraine for more Western support, suggested an effort by Mr. Zelensky to clean house and try to reassure Ukraine’s allies that his government would show zero tolerance for graft, or even lesser misbehavior.', 'A deputy defense minister was among those removed from their posts on Tuesday, as was a deputy prosecutor general who caused a furor by taking a wartime vacation to Spain with his family.

Ukraine was struggling to get control over flourishing corruption long before the invasion, and Mr. Zelensky campaigned successfully in 2019 as a political outsider who would clean house.

But at regular intervals, the authorities have been removing the flowers.', '“In contemporary Russia, under these conditions, it is a battle — a silent battle,” said Tatyana Krupina, a 28-year-old chemist who went with a small group of friends to lay flowers last week.', 'This is what passes for protest in Russia in January 2023, 11 months after the invasion. Russians have also begun laying flowers in other cities, spurred by social media.', 'The flower tussle is one of the first public protests taking place on a large scale since the days after President Vladimir V. Putin’s announcement last September that hundreds of thousands of men would be called up to fight.', 'Russia has imposed harsh penalties for criticizing the war, or even calling it one, so for many Russians, laying flowers seems like a rare opportunity to show dissent without being arrested.', 'For antigovernment Russians remaining in Russia, the flowers remind them that they are not alone in their opposition to the war, even as the propaganda becomes increasingly vitriolic and the letters Z and V, which have become pro-war symbols, are etched on public buildings.', 'And for Russians who fled because of persecution, potential conscription or a refusal to pay taxes that will fuel the war machine, the flower memorial is a sign that there are still people left in the country who are brave enough to protest.', '“This is not only a way to show people in Ukraine that there are people in Russia who do not condone what is happening; it shows people that they are not alone,” said Aleksandr Plyushchev, a popular Russian journalist with a significant following on YouTube.', 'But even laying flowers has potential consequences. At least seven people have been detained, according to a New York Times journalist who witnessed the episodes over the past week. Four were detained after placing flowers at the site.', 'The police have tried to prevent people from photographing the memorial, and have told others to delete the images from their phones.

She was referring to not being able to express her opinion publicly.', 'Ms. Varenik, 26, said she last protested when the opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny was arrested two years ago. She stayed home when thousands protested the war mobilization.

He said, “There is only one positive effect: Maybe someone will find out who Lesya Ukrainka is — a great poet — and read her work.”', 'The statue has been the site of altercations with pro-war nationalists, who have denounced the mourners and accused them in reports to the authorities of discrediting the Russian military, which is now a crime in Russia.', 'The Kremlin’s crackdown on political opposition and protests accelerated after the invasion of Ukraine. About 20,000 protesters have been detained since the war began, according to OVD Info, a human rights watchdog. Many lost their jobs after protesting, signing petitions or writing social media posts critical of the war.', 'Ilya Yashin, a municipal councilor in Moscow, was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for speaking about Russian atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine.

Or someone from the private military company Wagner will come to try to recruit me to fight in Ukraine with threats that if I don’t sign up? They’ll just drive me to the point where I kill myself.”', 'Still, some who risk arrest insist on showing their resistance.', '“Moscow is a huge city, and everyone is quiet,” said Ms. Varenik, the lawyer, before she was detained for her antiwar poster. “I want to show the world that we should not be quiet.

It has been as much a psychological shock to Germany as a political one, undercutting many of its assumptions about Russia; its president, Vladimir V. Putin; and the role of Germany in a Europe suddenly at war.', 'Nowhere is the disorientation more apparent than in Germany’s reluctance, for now, to send Ukraine its excellent main battle tank, the Leopard 2, or to allow other countries to do so. The stance has risked isolating Germany and exasperating its allies. Most important, the Ukrainians say, Germany’s hesitance threatens to hamper their ability to hold off or turn around an anticipated Russian offensive this spring.', 'While Germans overwhelmingly support Ukraine in its fight, the hesitation on sending tanks reflects the deep ambivalence in a nation with a catastrophic history of aggression during World War II and that remains profoundly divided about being a military leader and risking a direct confrontation with Russia. Opinion polls show that half of Germans do not want to send tanks.', '“German reluctance here can be summed up in one word, and that’s ‘history,’” said Steven E. Sokol, the president of the American Council on Germany.', '“Germans want to be seen as a partner, not an aggressor, and they have a particular sensitivity to delivering arms in regions where German arms were historically used to kill millions of people,” he said, citing Russia, Poland and Ukraine. “People do not want German weapons on the front lines being used to kill people in those regions.”', 'But Germans risk misinterpreting the lessons of their history, said Timothy Garton Ash, a historian of Germany and Europe at St. Antony’s College at Oxford. “The German position is profoundly confused, with the old thinking dead and the new not yet born,” he said.', 'Indeed, despite Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s declaration early last year of a “Zeitenwende,” or historical turning point, for Germany, his government and his country have struggled to follow through in building up its military. While the Ukraine war has prompted a serious debate in democratic Germany, it is hardly finished, Mr. Garton Ash said.', 'The result has been what the chancellor’s critics see as the overly tentative leadership of Mr. Scholz at this moment of crisis. The confusion has been especially pronounced within Mr. Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which heads the current government, said Boris Ruge, a vice chairman of the Munich Security Conference.', 'But politics are at play, too. Both the Social Democrats and the Greens, the largest members of the governing coalition, have strong pacifist wings that party leaders, like Mr. Scholz, cannot ignore.', '“Scholz has to think of domestic politics, too,” Mr. Ruge said. “On issues of strategy and politics, many of the Social Democrats are dyed-in-the-wool pacifists, and he must pay attention to them.”', 'To some degree, Mr. Scholz is leading not a three-party coalition, but a five-party one, if one counts the pacifist wings of the Greens and Social Democrats. And the Social Democrats have many voters in the former East Germany, which has been more sympathetic to Moscow.', 'There is also concern, and not only among Germans, that escalating the war with Western tanks will just increase the killing without fundamentally altering the course of the war.', 'German voters want their leaders always “to push the so-called peace option, to be last to move, or to move in a coalition,” said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “That shows that you’re not warmongering, you’re not pushing a military agenda.”', 'The clear pattern for Mr. Scholz is to move slowly, to try to bring his voters along (despite the annoyance of his NATO allies), and to finally agree to send in the tanks once he convinces the German public that it will actually bring peace closer by pushing Russia to negotiate.', 'The approach is an attempt to both respect and circumnavigate historical memory in a country where many of the names of battlegrounds in Ukraine are familiar to elderly Germans or even to younger ones who grew up hearing of them from their parents.', '“Why do we know Azovstal?” asked Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff, referring to the enormous steelworks in Mariupol that the Russians blasted for months during the war. “Who occupied Azovstal last? That was the Germans,” he said.', '“Everybody who is older here knows what the killing fields are. The names are familiar to them. Sending tanks there? Wow. Sending howitzers there? Well, to many older people, that’s still hard,” he said. History matters: “You can turn it any way you want, but there is memory.”', 'Those guilty memories are about a war against the Soviet Union. But even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Germans associated their guilt with Russia, as the successor state, not with other new post-Soviet nations, like Ukraine and Belarus, where the Nazis killed even more people, said Claudia Major of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “We did so much harm to the Soviet Union we can’t do this again, we say, but we equalize it with Russia and forget that Ukraine took it the worst.”', 'Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats were shaped by “Ostpolitik,” their outreach to the Soviet-occupied nations of Central and Eastern Europe, which also proved very profitable for German industry and provided all that cheap Russian energy. Much of the party is driven by “the conviction that peace cannot be achieved by military means,” as Mr. Scholz himself said in a speech in the late 1980s, Mr. Garton Ash said.', '“So it’s very difficult for him to think his way into his own Zeitenwende and believe that in certain circumstances, war can be the lesser evil and the shortest path to a lasting peace in Ukraine,” he said.', 'From that perspective, he added, “Germany has a unique historical responsibility to help defend a free and sovereign Ukraine and shape a larger European response to end Putin’s criminal war of terror.”', 'Jeffrey C. Herf, a scholar of German and European history at the University of Maryland, said that many Germans suppressed the reality that the Nazis were defeated only by military force, not by diplomatic or business engagement. “These lessons about appeasement and its dangers are unfashionable in the political world in which Scholz emerged,” he said.', 'At the same time, Germany’s centuries-long relationship with Moscow has the quality of a fixation, Mr. Garton Ash said, noting “a fascination with and fear of Russia, which created a blindness to Ukraine, and the parallel fear of a nuclear war.”', 'This is a prime explanation for Mr. Scholz’s desire to provide tanks only if the United States also provides tanks, so Russia cannot blame Berlin. He wants to avoid having a German decision — not merely to send Leopards but also to authorize their export — be singled out by a nuclear-armed Russia, a Russia that many Germans want to have decent relations with after this conflict inevitably ends.', 'Mr. Scholz and his aides argue that Germany has done a lot already, breaking its own taboo on sending weapons to a country at war, and sending the third-largest tranche of military aid to Ukraine.', 'In an interview last month, Mr. Scholz’s chief of staff, Wolfgang Schmidt, said that the chancellor saw his role as easing the transition to a new foreign policy in a population used to decades of pacifism.', '“A long-lasting tradition of all political parties — no weapons to conflict zones, let alone to a war — was completely shifted by Chancellor Scholz, and yet it received broad public support,” Mr. Schmidt said. “We always try to make sure that with all our actions, we can sustain them, and it’s not just a one off — that we keep our society together and the people behind it.”', 'Public opinion does seem to be shifting under pressure from allies and given the horrors of the war, said Thorsten Benner, the director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, who studies the Social Democrats. “If Scholz goes and says now is the moment, I think he can get the public behind him,” he said. “The numbers in the polls, you can shift that. That’s called leadership.”', 'German politicians who favor sending tanks say that Germany’s resistance to “going it alone” now risks isolating it. Johann Wadephul, a deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democrats, said Mr. Scholz’s argument for solidarity was contradicted by the pleas of his allies. “The chancellor’s refusal and Germany’s non-deliveries are in fact ‘going it alone,’” he said.', 'Heinrich Brauss, a former German general now with the German Council on Foreign Relations, argued that defeating Russia in Ukraine is in Germany’s self-interest, because the Ukrainians are fighting for European security. If German reluctance becomes German refusal, he warned, it would be disastrous for Germany’s reputation. “And it will reduce trust in Germany as an ally in NATO significantly.”']"

Each agreement must be implemented as quickly as possible.”', 'Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that he was “optimistic” that Germany would decide to allow transfers of the Leopards and that his country’s troops would begin training on the tanks in Poland in the meantime.', '“Countries that already have Leopard tanks can begin training missions for our tank crews,” Mr. Reznikov told Voice of America’s Ukrainian service on Friday. “We will start with that, and we will go from there.”', 'Poland’s Defense Ministry did not immediately confirm Mr. Reznikov’s assertion, but Polish officials have been among the most vociferous voices urging Germany to clear the way for Leopards. The Polish government has said it stands ready to send some of its own, though legally it needs Germany to sign off on any such move.', 'Many Western defense officials meeting in Germany on Friday had hoped to reach a deal on sending the German-made tanks, which are stocked by many European countries and which Ukraine sees as crucial to its war effort. But the meeting ended without a decision from Germany, which so far has resisted sending its own Leopards to Ukraine or giving other countries that have them the necessary approval to export them.', 'Germany has also pushed for the United States to take the lead by sending some of its most advanced battle tanks, the M1 Abrams, but on Saturday criticism was largely falling on Berlin.', 'Ukraine’s appeals for tanks and more weapons from the West have taken on greater urgency with the approach of spring, when both sides to the conflict are preparing offensives, officials have said. And Russia’s recent claims to have captured the small towns of Soledar and Klishchiivka — part of a broader push to seize the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine — have added to the growing pressure.', 'The war overall “is in a state of deadlock,” Britain’s Defense Ministry said on Saturday, but it warned that there was “a realistic possibility of local Russian advances around Bakhmut.”', 'In recent weeks, the West has pledged increasingly sophisticated weapons for Ukraine, agreeing to send Patriot missile systems and armored fighting vehicles, despite earlier fears that Russia would see the provision of those weapons as a provocation. But Western-made tanks, which are far more powerful than the fighting vehicles, have been a sticking point. Britain this week confirmed it would send a small number of Challenger 2 tanks, as part of wider efforts to persuade other Western nations to offer similar support.', 'Ukraine’s top military officer, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has said his forces need at least 300 tanks and 600 infantry fighting vehicles to counter the Russians this spring. But Germany has been reluctant to send in some of its Leopard 2 tanks without Washington’s pledging to send at least a token number of its M1 Abrams tanks, presenting a united front against Russia. Washington has argued against sending Abrams tanks, saying that they use jet fuel and are difficult to maintain. The defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, said Friday that he had no comment on whether that stance would change.', 'American and German officials made a point on Friday of dismissing any suggestion of acrimony among the allies, though there are subtle signs of growing fissures. Mr. Austin and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, denied the Leopard dispute was linked to the Abrams tanks, but provided no explanation for what was stalling a deal, and emphasized that the Leopard tanks could still be sent in the near future.', 'Mr. Pistorius said he had ordered his ministry to begin an inventory of its Leopard tanks and to prepare to train Ukrainian soldiers in case of a future deal, noting that he would welcome similar preparations by other European countries.', 'Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has been vocal about sending more weapons to Ukraine and was in Kyiv on Friday, said, using an expletive, that he was tired of the circus “surrounding who is going to send tanks and when are they going to send them.”', '“To the Germans: Send tanks to Ukraine because they need them. It is in your own national interest that Putin loses in Ukraine,” he wrote on Twitter late Friday. “To the Biden Administration: Send American tanks so that others will follow our lead.”', 'When asked by a reporter on Friday if he supported Poland’s call to send the Leopards, President Biden was brief. “Ukraine is going to get all the help they need,” he said.']"

Putin in “Le Mage du Kremlin,” or “The Wizard of the Kremlin,” a novel exploring the inner workings of his government that has captivated France, winning prizes and selling over 430,000 copies.', 'Published shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last February, the novel has become a popular guide for understanding Mr. Putin’s motives. It has also turned its Swiss-Italian author, Giuliano da Empoli, into a coveted “Kremlinologist,” invited to lunch with the French prime minister and to France’s top morning news show to analyze the war’s developments.', 'The success has illustrated the continued power of literature in France, where novels have long shaped public debate. Élisabeth Borne, the prime minister, said through a spokesman that she “really enjoyed his book, which mixes fiction and reality and echoes international current events and the war in Ukraine.”', 'But in a country where literary hits are a kind of Rorschach test, the novel’s success has also raised concerns about whether it is shaping France’s views on Russia. Its detractors say the book conveys a largely sympathetic portrayal of Mr. Putin that may influence policy in a country that is already chastised as too forgiving of the Russian leader.', '“The Wizard of the Kremlin,” which at times reads like an essay, is built around a fictionalized account of a powerful longtime Putin aide musing on Western decadence, the United States’ goal of bringing Russia to “its knees” and Russians’ preference for a strong leader — typical Kremlin talking points that critics say go unchallenged throughout the pages.', 'At best, the book’s popularity echoes what Gérard Araud, the former French ambassador to the United States, called “a kind of French fascination with Russia” fueled by a shared history of revolution, empire and cultural masterpieces.', 'At worst, critics say, it signals lenient views of Mr. Putin that are enduring in France and may shape the country’s stance on the war, as reflected in President Emmanuel Macron’s calls not to humiliate Russia.', '“The book conveys the clichés of Russian propaganda with a few small nuances,” said Cécile Vaissié, a political scientist specializing in Russia at Rennes 2 University. “When I see its success, that worries me.”', 'Dissecting politics was nothing new to Mr. da Empoli. A former deputy mayor of Florence, Italy, and adviser to an Italian prime minister, he has already published a dozen political essays in Italian and French, including one on Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential run.', 'But Mr. da Empoli wanted to try fiction and had a “fascination” with the way Russian power is projected. So he modeled his debut novel’s narrator on one of the country’s most intriguing figures, Vladislav Y. Surkov.', '“The challenge of the book is to take the devil’s point of view,” Mr. da Empoli said.', 'Until recently, Mr. Surkov was Mr. Putin’s chief ideologist and one of the architects of the extreme centralized control exerted by Mr. Putin, earning him a reputation as a puppet master and the title “Putin’s Rasputin.”', '“The character’s rather novelistic nature struck me,” said Mr. da Empoli, a soft-spoken, restrained 49-year-old who now teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris. He added that he had visited Russia four times and had read numerous essays on the country’s politics and the Putin regime during his research.', 'The narrator chronicles the inner workings of Mr. Putin’s government. He crosses paths with real-life Kremlin players like Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the founder of the infamous Wagner mercenary group, with whom he sets up troll farms to spread disinformation and division in the West.', 'Mr. da Empoli handed in his manuscript to Gallimard, his publisher, two years ago.

It received a prize from the Académie Française and fell short of the Goncourt, France’s most prestigious literary award, by only one vote after an extraordinary 14 rounds of voting.', 'Top politicians and diplomats publicly praised the novel. Édouard Philippe, a former prime minister, hailed it as a great “meditation on power.” Mr. da Empoli was invited on every talk show to analyze the current conflict.', '“Circumstances have obviously changed the way the book was received,” said Mr. da Empoli, who sees his novel more as political fiction than as a guide to understanding Russia. “I didn’t necessarily expect that.”', 'He was not the only one surprised.', 'Several Russia experts have expressed dismay at the novel’s enthusiastic reception.

Six floors up, Yevgeniy Botvynov had just curled up with his wife, Olha, under a blanket, trying to keep warm during yet another power outage.', 'On the other side of the building, two couples had gathered in their kitchens on the fourth floor, one of them warming a late lunch, the other doting on their 1-year-old son.', 'It was what passes for an ordinary Saturday for ordinary Ukrainian people these days, in a place far from the front lines of the war with Russia, but never fully at peace. All day, air-raid warnings were sounding, forcing people to make calculations that have become habitual: Go to a shelter or stay home?

And then, suddenly, it does not.', 'Around 3:40 p.m. on the 325th day of Russia’s full-fledged war in Ukraine, an ordinary Saturday turned extraordinary when the Russian Kh-22 missile slammed into 118 Victory Embankment.', 'More than 30 apartments were instantly incinerated, with nothing left but a column of swirling ash. Along the singed periphery, some units were sliced apart with almost surgical precision, exposing the contents of people’s living rooms, bathrooms and kitchens to the open air. A bowl of fruit sat unscathed on the table in one kitchen that had been opened up like a dollhouse; in another unit, a painting of a dog hung crookedly on a kitchen wall — though the kitchen was no longer there.', 'On Thursday, the authorities raised the death toll to 46, including six children; 80 were wounded. It was one of the deadliest single attacks against civilians since the early weeks of the war.', 'The apartment building, an enormous Soviet-era edifice, forms a large inverted J that curls around an internal courtyard, with the largest section facing the Dnipro River. An estimated 1,700 people called it home.', 'The missile hit just above the joint where the building began to curve away from the embankment. For those at the center of the impact, death came instantly: The explosion simply vaporized some residents, according to the authorities.', 'Olha Usova, a 36-year-old dentist, happened to be walking by on her way to a newly opened gym when the missile struck. A single piece of shrapnel pierced her heart, her husband, Eduard, said, killing her instantly. He said he felt that with normal attacks, you had a decent chance of surviving just by remaining indoors. This one was different.', '“In this case,” he said, “such a rocket left no chance for survival.”', 'Many did manage to survive, but that often depended on where in their homes they were at the moment of impact. Many found themselves trapped, the missile’s force having sheared off the stairwells on two sides of the building.', 'Mr. Botvynov, who had been cuddling with his wife under a blanket, first had to pull himself free from the twisted remains of a balcony that had crashed through his living room. Then he grabbed his heavily bleeding wife and rushed to the front door.

The Kh-22 is a 1960s-era anti-ship missile launched by Russian bombers that is designed to attack warships at sea, and it may have more limited abilities to accurately attack targets on land.', 'A power station directly across the river from the complex could have been an intended target, part of Russia’s strategy of starving Ukrainians of electricity, though it was roughly two miles away. The Kremlin has denied that a Russian missile was involved, blaming an errant Ukrainian air-defense missile. Military experts have dismissed this claim as yet another Russian fabrication, pointing to the colossal damage.', 'The day of the attack was a holiday in Ukraine, when many celebrate what is known as Old New Year, based on the Orthodox Church’s pre-modern calendar. That made Olha Afanasieva, 49, anxious. After 11 months of war, Ukrainians believe that the Kremlin takes a twisted pleasure in attacking on holidays.', '“For me, it was such an anxious day,” she said, adding that she had insisted that her husband not go fishing as planned. “I felt like something was about to happen.”', 'Ms. Afanasieva’s husband, Oleh Valovyi, took things in stride, though. Rockets had rained down on a number of cities that day, and the entire country was under an alert for hours.', '“There are not that many bomb shelters,” Mr. Valovyi said, “and you get tired of running there because the air-raid alarms sound practically every day, several times a day.”', 'The couple were seated at their kitchen table when the missile hit, she with her left side facing a window, he directly in front of it.

But he expressed confusion over Russia’s choice of target.', '“I work at a company that deals with agriculture, selling parts for the tractors, a completely peaceful profession,” he said. “Surely, my death would not have any military significance.”', 'How rescuers noticed Ms. Zelenska, the deaf woman, is unclear, but by Sunday morning, firefighters attached to safety lines and standing on a platform suspended by a crane were working furiously at the spot where her apartment had been. They cut away debris for hours. Finally, she appeared covered in dust, alive but visibly distressed.', 'For the next 48 hours, firefighters continued to hack at the concrete slabs that had pancaked onto Ms. Zelenska’s apartment, searching for her husband and son.', 'By Tuesday morning, the couple’s families had gathered at the site in what was a mostly silent vigil, until, as the sun came up, Ms. Zelenska’s father, Mykola Kulak, vented his anger.', '“The Russians, let them all perish, these devils,” he screamed, holding up his phone to show a video of his grandson. “This child is still lying under the rubble! I am cursing them, and I wish that every Russian family has two or three, just like this, lying there like our child.”', 'Shortly afterward, rescuers brought down the bodies — first Mykyta, then Oleksii — using a special crane. They were placed on the ground in black body bags as their family waited to carry out the wrenching task of identifying them.', 'Oleksii’s parents knelt in front of their son’s body, unzipped the bag and for several interminable minutes caressed him, sobbing.', 'Ms. Zelenska’s parents had rushed off earlier to join their daughter, who had been hospitalized since being rescued two days earlier. She had found out on the internet that the bodies of her husband and son had been recovered, the first confirmation she had that they were dead.', 'On Tuesday afternoon, the authorities declared an end to the search, but by evening, firefighters had returned to 118 Victory Embankment for an unexpected rescue mission.

After about 20 minutes, a firefighter emerged from the kitchen window, a red and white cat carrier in hand. Inside, was a dirty and frightened Belyash.', '“We’re going home,” said Rostyslav, peering into the carrier when at last he and his pet were reunited. “Not this home, of course, but everything will be OK.”']"

Putin’s failure to split the NATO allies after nearly a year of war. But small yet significant fractures are getting too big to hide.', 'The differences are over strategy for the coming year and the more immediate question of what Ukraine needs in the next few months, as both sides in the war prepare for major offensives in the spring. And while most of those debates take place behind closed doors, Britain’s impatience with the current pace of aid and Germany’s refusal to provide Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine broke out into public view this week.', 'When the new British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, visited Washington this week, he gathered reporters for lunch and made the case that it is possible for Ukraine to score a “victory” in the war this year if the allies move fast to exploit Russia’s weaknesses. Officials in Poland, the Baltic States and Finland have largely agreed with the British assessment.', 'American officials pushed back, saying it is critical to pace the aid, and not flood Ukraine with equipment its troops cannot yet operate. And they argue that in a world of limited resources, it would be wise to keep something in reserve for what the Pentagon believes will likely be a drawn-out conflict, in which Russia will try to wear Ukraine down with relentless barrages and tactics reminiscent of World War I and II.', 'On Friday, at the conclusion of a meeting in Germany of the dozens of nations supplying the war effort, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, repeated the assessment he has offered since the fall.', '“For this year it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces,” he said. The best that could be hoped for is pressing Russia into a diplomatic negotiation — the way most wars end — though senior American diplomats say they have low expectations that Mr. Putin will enter serious talks.', 'Then came the more immediate blowup with the German government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, over his refusal to send what many military experts believe could be a decisive weapon in Ukrainian hands: the German-built Leopard 2 tanks.', 'Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spent several days trying to persuade the Germans to ship them, or at least allow Poland and other nations that use the tanks to re-export them. But by the time the meeting with scores of allies ended, the German defense minister, Boris Pistorius, reported that no agreement had been reached, although he said they would make a decision “as soon as possible.” He and Mr. Austin tried to focus on the unity of the effort to confront Russia, rather than the obvious rift over arms.', 'Differences of strategy among wartime allies are the norm, not the exception. In World War II there were major debates about whether to focus on defeating Nazi Germany first, and turn to Japan — which had actually attacked American territory — second. Similar debates happened during the Korean War, Vietnam and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because the United States was providing the bulk of the fighting force, it usually prevailed.', 'But in interviews with American, British and other European officials, including senior military leaders, it is clear that Ukraine is different. Only the Ukrainians are on the line, and no one wants to tell them how to fight a battle in which their forces, the only ones engaged in the daily brutality, have shown both grit and determination. But with both Russia and Ukraine planning fresh offensives, the debate over strategy and arms has reached what the NATO secretary general has called “an inflection point.”', 'The Ukrainians have made no secret that much as they appreciate the support of their allies, what they are getting is not enough. When Britain announced earlier this week that it was sending Challenger 2 tanks, Ukraine’s foreign minister and defense ministers issued a joint statement thanking the British government but adding that “it is not sufficient to achieve operational goals.”', 'Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, was typically blunt. After thanking the United States for a $2.5 billion contribution of arms, atop $3 billion announced several weeks ago, he said: “Hundreds of thank yous are not hundreds of tanks.”', 'In an appearance on German television, he said: “If you have Leopards, then give them to us.”', 'American officials were clearly frustrated after their negotiations with the German government this week. Germany had begun by saying that it would send Leopard tanks, and authorize others to, if the United States sent its M-1 Abrams tank as well. The United States declined, saying the tank is such a gas guzzler — it employs a jet engine — and requires such a supply line to keep running that it would not be useful in Ukraine’s environment. (The officials dodged questions about why a tank so difficult to operate on European battlefields is in the American arsenal.)', 'The British Challengers and German Leopards are more flexible and easier to run. But in public, Mr. Austin and others avoided criticizing Mr. Scholz, who in their view has managed the biggest reversal of German foreign policy — starting with the suspension of two pipelines bringing gas from Russia — quite skillfully.', 'Mr. Scholz’s real concern, they suspect, is that he does not believe the world is ready to see German tanks near the borders of Russia, a reminder of the Nazi invasion in World War II. One senior American official said this week that if Mr. Scholz and the German public are worried about that, in these circumstances “they are the only ones who are.”', 'While Germany did not say yes to sending Leopard tanks this week, it didn’t say no, either — at least not yet. But Ukraine has a very narrow window of time in which to launch a potentially decisive spring offensive before the Russians do, and the tanks are a key part of that effort.', 'Before that launch, Ukraine has to muster thousands of combat-ready troops, receive new advanced weapons from the West, and train their soldiers in how to use and maintain those arms. Getting all that done would be, according to General Milley, “a very, very heavy lift.”', 'That’s why Germany’s delay on approving tanks was so frustrating to Mr. Austin and other top Western officials who had been trying all week to reach an agreement with their German counterparts to provide what Ukraine needs now to wrest back territory.', '“If we stop now or limit or diminish it, it will all have been in vain,” Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch foreign affairs minister, said in an interview. “We have to double down. There is no substitute for victory on the battlefield.”', 'Speaking about the current German position, a British official said that London’s commitment to send Challenger tanks was intended to encourage other nations to do likewise, and that the British government still hoped it would.', 'At a news conference after Friday’s meeting, Mr. Austin sought to play down the importance of the Leopard tanks and highlight what Germany has provided — fighting vehicles, air defenses and training ranges for Ukrainian soldiers — no doubt hoping Berlin eventually would come around on Ukraine’s main request.', '“This isn’t really about one single platform,” Mr. Austin said, quickly pivoting to note that Ukraine was still getting more than 100 Bradley fighting vehicles and nearly 90 Stryker combat vehicles from the United States, the equivalent of “two brigades of combat power.”', 'Still, Mr. Austin signaled the calendar is not on Ukraine’s side. “We have a window of opportunity here, between now and the spring,” he said. “That’s not a long time.”']"

But Germany has refused to send its own Leopards to Ukraine or to give its approval to other countries to export them, not wanting to be the first to take the step and asking that the United States send its best tank, the M1 Abrams, as well.', 'The failure to strike a deal was quickly criticized by some Ukrainians as well as the Polish and Latvian governments, who have argued that tanks are critical to claw back territory seized by Russia early in its invasion and to defend against an expected Russian offensive in the spring.', '“Arming Ukraine in order to repel the Russian aggression is not some kind of decision-making exercise.

Yet, the provision of main battle tanks remained a step that many countries were reluctant to take.', 'That began to change in recent weeks, as Britain announced a shipment of tanks to Ukraine and pressure rose on Germany from Eastern European and Baltic countries to at least allow them to send their Leopard 2 tanks, which number about 2,000 in 14 countries across Europe.

At a news conference on Friday, the chancellor’s spokesman, Steffen Hebestreit, said that Germany was following three principles: “The first is to back Ukraine as much as possible. The second is to prevent NATO and Germany from becoming warring parties. The third thing is that we are not going it alone nationally, but are coordinating very closely with our international partners — above all the U.S.A.”', 'Germany’s reluctance to send tanks is likely to stem from fears about the risks of escalation and potential retaliation by Russia, said Thorsten Benner, the director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.', '“It would be a significant step for this main battle tank, the Leopard system, to go into Ukraine, and they want maximum reassurance from the U.S.,” he said. “There must be something in their heads about Germany being targeted in retaliation for sending this kind of signature German main battle tank — what that is, Scholz hasn’t spelled it out.”', '', 'For all the efforts to play down the divisions among the Western allies, the failure to reach a deal showed there were still major rifts among Ukraine’s supporters, especially between Eastern European nations demanding speedy action and the countries that have called for caution.', '“Every day is worth its weight in gold, Ukraine needs to be supported, so we continue this diplomatic pressure together,” Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Pawel Jablonski, said after the meeting. “We will use different methods of direct and indirect persuasion, and we hope that this attitude will change — as it was with the Patriots.”', 'But aides to Germany’s chancellor argue that Mr. Scholz’s position is very close to that of President Biden, who has only gradually provided Ukraine with advanced weapons such as HIMARS rocket systems and Patriot missile air defenses.', 'Mr. Austin and Mr. Pistorius denied there were demands connecting U.S. and German tanks, though they provided no explanation for what was stalling a deal.', '“There is no linkage between providing M1s and providing Leopards,” said Mr. Austin, adding that officials at the meeting were “pushing hard” to meet Ukraine’s needs for tanks and armored vehicles.

And at 20 to 23.5 tons they weigh far less than the Bradley, which can weigh as much as 40 tons, according to a 2016 report from the Congressional Research Service.', 'While Bradleys run on treads, which offer excellent traction over uneven terrain, Strykers run on eight wheels which can still function even if they have been hit with bullets or shrapnel.', 'Strykers are also much faster than Bradleys, capable of speeds of 60 miles per hour, according to the congressional report.', 'The Stryker can also be configured in a number of different variants, including some for use by engineers or as ambulances.', 'The Pentagon’s announcement Thursday said that the 90 Strykers would also be provided with 20 mine-rollers — wheeled sleds that are designed to be heavy enough to trigger anti-vehicle land mines and are pushed ahead of armored vehicles in the hopes of clearing safe paths through minefields.', 'As the war between Ukraine and Russia has evolved into a more static battle between entrenched soldiers protected by belts of anti-tank land mines, the combination of Strykers with mine-rollers and additional demolition equipment for what the Pentagon referred to as “obstacle clearing” indicates that the United States is providing Ukraine with specific capabilities intended to enable Kyiv’s armed forces to break though Russian defenses.']"

But after British officials gave word last week that they would send a platoon of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, demands have amped up for Berlin and Washington to quickly follow suit.', 'Ben Barry, a ground warfare expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the pressure campaign by Ukraine and its immediate neighbors in Eastern Europe harkened back to a lesson from World War II, when the United States supplied the British Army with Sherman tanks to beat back enemy forces in Europe and North Africa.', 'Now, Mr. Barry said, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is banking on a similar appeal.', '“It’s the same message: ‘Give us the tools and we will finish the job,’” Mr. Barry said.', 'Here is a look at the debate over sending tanks to Ukraine.', 'Following pitched battles for control of territory over the last year, officials said it was clear that tanks would be crucial in pushing back Russian forces. That has taken on increased importance this winter, given a limited window for Ukraine to seize an advantage before Russia deploys hundreds of thousands of newly conscripted soldiers in an anticipated spring offensive.', 'Ukraine’s most senior military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, has said his forces need about 300 Western tanks to make a difference in battles for fiercely contested cities and towns in the eastern provinces that border Russia.', 'Over the last year, NATO allies in Eastern Europe supplied Ukraine with Soviet-era and Russian-made tanks that have been ground down or destroyed in constant fighting. Providing the sophisticated battle tanks — one of the most powerful symbols of war — was long seen as a red line by the United States and its closest European allies who feared Russian retaliation.', 'But the debate shifted this month, with France, Germany and the United States announcing plans to send, for the first time, armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine to help in the grinding ground war. Days later, Britain said it would send a platoon of Challenger 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, some arriving within weeks.', 'That fueled pressure on other allies — namely Germany and the United States — to step up.', 'Germany has long refused to send its most potent weapons to countries in conflict, a byproduct of its legacy of starting World War II. That has included prohibiting the export of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine — even those that have been sold to other armies.', 'The reluctance also reflects a sharp division among Germans — as indicated in recent polling — over sending battle tanks to Ukraine despite widespread support for providing other weapons.', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany has repeatedly said he would not “go it alone” when it comes to sending weapons into Ukraine, and would only act in concert with allies.', 'In practice, that has more narrowly meant that he will not act without Washington. This week, German officials said that Mr. Scholz has insisted Berlin will not send any of its own Leopard tanks unless the United States sends its M1 Abrams tanks as well.', 'What is not yet clear is whether Mr. Scholz would allow other nations to send their Leopards without sending any itself. Poland and Finland have already said they would donate the tanks from their own stockpiles if Berlin issues licenses to re-export them.', 'Experts believe there are an estimated 2,000 German-made Leopard 2 tanks in use by at least 13 European militaries.', 'One German lawmaker familiar with the weapons delivery debate said that, so far, no European nation has formally asked Berlin to permit their Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine. The German lawmaker also described allies as hesitant to send the tanks unless Berlin joined them in a show of unity against Russia.', 'Johann Wadephul, the deputy chairman of the Christian Democrats, Germany’s largest opposition party, said Mr. Scholz’s resistance to sending Leopards undermined his argument of seeking solidarity. “The chancellor’s refusal, and Germany’s non-deliveries, are in fact ‘going it alone’,” he said in Parliament on Thursday.', 'Another lawmaker, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmerman, head of the Defense Committee in the German Parliament, said that Mr. Scholz was likely to have offered at least some Leopards in conversations with Washington this week.', '“I think he’s ready to approve the export of the tanks, and to make Leopards available himself — but he wants the Americans to provide their main battle tanks as well,” said Ms. Strack-Zimmerman, a member of the liberal Free Democrats, one of the three parties in the government coalition with Mr. Scholz and his Social Democrats.', 'She said the chancellor was wrong to insist on American tank deliveries. “There are enough tanks in Europe, and the war is on our doorstep,” Ms. Strack-Zimmerman said.', 'That is not expected any time soon, according to two American defense officials, if ever.', 'On Thursday, U.S. officials said they would send about 100 additional fighting vehicles — known as Strykers and Bradleys — to Ukraine. That is on top of 50 Bradley Fighting Vehicles the United States pledged earlier this month.', 'A senior administration official said the new vehicles were not meant to assuage Ukraine’s demands for tanks but, rather, to provide other equipment that would prove useful on the battlefield.', 'The Biden administration has long asserted that American-made M1 Abrams tanks — with their needs for specific fuel, frequent maintenance and spare parts, transport and training — are ill-suited to battle in eastern Ukraine, where supply lines could easily be cut off.', 'A Pentagon spokeswoman, Sabrina Singh, told reporters on Thursday that “it just doesn’t make sense” to provide Ukraine with Abrams tanks “at this moment” because they use jet fuel and are difficult to maintain. She said the Germans must make up their own minds about the Leopard 2s.', 'More broadly, officials worry that American tanks would be seen as a sign of escalation by the United States — a risky step for a global superpower that is trying to avoid a broader conflict.

Yet the Biden administration has held to a hard line since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, refusing to provide Kyiv with the weapons it needs to target the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia has been using as a base for launching devastating strikes.', 'Now that line is starting to soften.', 'After months of discussions with Ukrainian officials, the Biden administration is finally starting to concede that Kyiv may need the power to strike the Russian sanctuary, even if such a move increases the risk of escalation, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive debate. Crimea, between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, is home to tens of thousands of dug-in Russian troops and numerous Russian military bases.', 'White House officials insist there is no change in position. Crimea, they say, belongs to Ukraine.', '“We have said throughout the war that Crimea is Ukraine, and Ukraine has the right to defend themselves and their sovereign territory in their internationally recognized borders,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council.', 'Privately, military and administration officials had questioned the utility of Ukraine focusing attacks on Crimea, arguing Kyiv’s military had better targets elsewhere on the battlefield.', 'But the Biden administration has come to believe that if the Ukrainian military can show Russia that its control of Crimea can be threatened, that would strengthen Kyiv’s position in any future negotiations. In addition, fears that the Kremlin would retaliate using a tactical nuclear weapon have dimmed, U.S. officials and experts said — though they cautioned that the risk remained.', 'The new thinking on Crimea — annexed illegally by Russia in 2014 — shows how far Biden administration officials have come from the start of the war, when they were wary of even acknowledging publicly that the United States was providing Stinger antiaircraft missiles for Ukrainian troops.', 'But over the course of the conflict, the United States and its NATO allies have been steadily loosening the handcuffs they put on themselves, moving from providing Javelins and Stingers to advanced missile systems, Patriot air defense systems, armored fighting vehicles and even some Western tanks to give Ukraine the capacity to strike against Russia’s onslaught.', 'Now, the Biden administration is considering what would be one of its boldest moves yet, helping Ukraine to attack the peninsula that President Vladimir V. Putin views as an integral part of his quest to restore past Russian glory.', 'American officials are discussing with their Ukrainian counterparts the use of American-supplied weapons, from HIMARS rocket systems to Bradley fighting vehicles, to possibly target Mr. Putin’s hard-fought control over a land bridge that functions as a critical supply route connecting Crimea to Russia via the Russian-occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol.', 'However, President Biden is not yet ready to give Ukraine the long-range missile systems that Kyiv would need to attack Russian installations on the peninsula.', 'Ukrainian officials have long insisted that Crimea is an important target for their attacks, and that continuing military pressure on Russian bases there is a significant part of their strategy. Ukrainian military officials have also discussed with American officials the importance of increasing pressure on Russia’s rear echelon in Crimea, which supports military operations elsewhere in Ukraine.', 'With the Black Sea fleet, a major Russian air base, command posts and logistics hubs supporting Russian operations in southern Ukraine, the peninsula represents a major focus in Kyiv’s battle plans.', 'In deciding to give the Bradleys to Ukraine, the Biden administration moved closer to providing Kyiv with something for which senior Ukrainian officials have been imploring the United States for months: direct American help for Ukraine to go on the offense — including targeting Crimea.', 'The Bradleys are armored personnel carriers mounted with powerful 25-millimeter guns and guided missiles that can take on Russian tanks.', 'Frederick B. Hodges, a retired lieutenant general and former top U.S. Army commander in Europe, said that in the coming months the Bradleys could be used by Ukrainian troops to help sever the land bridge.', 'Being able to rely on military bases in Crimea for staging was the primary reason Russian forces were able to seize land in southern Ukraine last year, a U.S. official said. Making those forces less capable is a key battlefield goal of the Ukrainians.', '“Ukraine could use Bradleys to move forces down major roads, such as the M14, which connects Kherson, Melitopol and Mariupol,” added Seth G. Jones, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Any Ukrainian infantry advancing through these areas would face significant fire from Russian positions, and Bradleys offer helpful firepower and protection for troops.”', 'The Bradleys, along with British tanks and the armored combat vehicles that France and Germany have agreed to send, could be the vanguard of an armored force that Ukraine could employ in a counteroffensive this winter or spring, government and independent analysts say.', '“We think now is the right time to intensify our support for Ukraine,” Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said Tuesday while on a visit to Washington. “We can’t allow this to drag on and become a kind of First World War attritional-type stalemate.”', 'The British Defense Ministry said in a Twitter message last week that in recent weeks, Russia had bolstered defensive fortifications in central Zaporizhzhia, a province in southern Ukraine near the land bridge, and where Russia maintains a large force.', 'If Ukraine does focus on reclaiming Zaporizhzhia, then preliminary attacks could include hitting targets in nearby Crimea. “A major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia’s ‘land bridge,’” the British assessment said.', 'Ukraine also has American-provided HIMARS, long-range rocket systems. With the reclaiming last year of Kherson in the south, Ukrainian forward lines can now use them to hit the main supply routes coming out of Crimea, one American military official said in an interview.', 'This week, top U.S. and Ukrainian commanders will hold a high-level planning meeting in Germany to game out the offensive planning, another senior U.S. official said. The drill, the official said, is meant to align Ukraine’s battle plans with the kinds of weapons and supplies NATO allies are contributing.', 'Ukrainian officials fear their country cannot survive years of a stalemated conflict while Russia continues to pound cities and towns. So they see little choice but to target Crimea and put it in jeopardy, a senior U.S. official said, noting that the issue has come up at recent high-level meetings at the White House.', 'Still, despite the additional weaponry, the Biden administration does not think that Ukraine can take Crimea militarily — and indeed, there are still worries that such a move could drive Mr. Putin to retaliate with an escalatory response. But, officials said, their assessment now is that Russia needs to believe that Crimea is at risk, in part to strengthen Ukraine’s position in any future negotiations.', 'By demonstrating an ability to strike in Crimea, American officials say, Ukraine could show that Russian control is not established. The Biden administration also increasingly believes that hitting Russia’s rear lines coming out of Crimea could severely damage Moscow’s ability to push its front lines further, officials say.', '“Without Crimea, the whole thing falls apart,” said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Ukraine during the Obama administration.', 'Contributing to the shifting thinking is a dampening of fears that targeting Crimea would drive Mr. Putin to use a tactical nuclear weapon, officials say. “It feels to me like increasingly, the administration is recognizing that the threat of Russian escalation is perhaps not what they thought it was earlier,” General Hodges said.', 'While Ukrainian strikes inside Russia proper still bring escalatory concerns from U.S. officials, Moscow’s reaction to periodic Ukrainian special operations or covert attacks in Crimea, including against Russian air bases, command posts and ships in the Black Sea fleet, has been tempered.', '“There is more clarity on their tolerance for damage and attacks,” said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. “Crimea has already been hit many times without a massive escalation from the Kremlin.”', 'Still, Mr. Putin and the Russian public view Crimea as part of Russia, so strikes there could solidify Russian support for the war.', 'For their part, U.S. officials say they do not know how Mr. Putin will react if Ukraine attacks Crimea using American-supplied weapons.', 'Ms. Massicot said none of Ukraine’s handful of attacks on Crimea so far have threatened Russia’s ability to maintain its claim on the peninsula. “So they may not be an accurate test of Russia’s resolve on this point,” she said.', 'Last month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken reiterated standing American policy on Ukraine — that the Biden administration was seeking to help the country take back territory seized during and after the Russian invasion last year.', '“Our focus is on continuing to do what we’ve been doing, which is to make sure that Ukraine has in its hands what it needs to defend itself, what it needs to push back against the Russian aggression, to take back territory that’s been seized from it since Feb. 24,” Mr. Blinken told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council summit. By Mr. Blinken’s definition, that territory does not include Crimea.', 'That position, critics say, has largely given the Russian military an untouchable sanctuary from which to attack Ukraine.', '“We have in essence put limits on Ukraine, saying this war is going to be fought on your soil and not on Russian soil,” said Philip Breedlove, a retired four-star Air Force general who was NATO’s supreme allied commander for Europe when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. “To give Russia sanctuary from which to fight, without fear of reproach, is absolutely absurd. It makes no military sense.”']"

Mr. Biden has also tried to persuade the Dutch and the Japanese to sign on to American efforts to curb China’s access to semiconductors that could advance its own military technologies.', 'In recent days, the attacks on Dnipro have increased pressure on Western nations to do more to supply Kyiv with economic and military aid. Mr. Rutte’s interest in sending a Patriot system follows a decision in late December by American officials to supply and train Ukrainian troops. On Tuesday afternoon, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Twitter that he was grateful to the Dutch prime minister “for the intention to provide Patriot air defense system” to Ukraine.', '“It greatly improves air defense, protects our cities & people from RF’s missile terror,” he said, referring to the Russian Federation.', 'But pressure has also grown on Germany and the United States to follow Britain’s lead in pledging to send tanks to Ukraine, though neither government has said it would do so.', 'On Tuesday, Mr. Biden spoke to Mr. Scholz, the German chancellor, by phone. The two leaders “discussed their steadfast support to Ukraine and condemned Russia’s aggression,” according to a readout from the administration.', 'Aside from encouraging a united front against Russia, Mr. Biden has hoped that meeting with leaders in person can help build support for the sweeping restrictions his administration made in October on the sale to China of chips and the tools that can be used to make them. American officials believe the technology can be used to power supercomputers and weapons systems that might one day threaten the United States.', 'U.S. officials have for several years been in talks with the Netherlands and Japan, makers of the world’s most advanced equipment for manufacturing semiconductors, to limit the kinds of technology they sell to China.', 'The restrictions put in place by the Biden administration included limits on foreign-made chips that are manufactured with U.S. technology. But the United States stopped short of regulating foreign-made manufacturing equipment, like that produced by the Dutch firm ASML.', 'The United States makes much of the most advanced equipment needed by global semiconductor factories, known as fabs. In the short term, the new restrictions have been “like punching a hole into every chip fab in China that meets the technical specifications of the rules,” said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.', 'But the measures could prove to be less effective over time, she said, if foreign companies like ASML or Japan’s Tokyo Electron are lured by China’s huge market into trying to develop and sell their own versions of U.S. technology.', '“If there are other countries that are not subject to the same level of controls, there’s this really strong structural incentive for these foreign companies to develop alternatives to U.S. technology,” Ms. Kilcrease said.', 'American companies say the measures will put them at a disadvantage compared with foreign competitors. Lam Research, a chip-making technology provider, forecast a revenue hit of $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year. Applied Materials, another equipment company, has given similar estimates.', 'The Biden administration had hoped to issue its October rules in tandem with allies and had spent months in discussions with them, including the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Israel and Britain.', 'But while many of these governments recognize Beijing as a rising national security threat, they have been reluctant to cut off important commerce with China. In both Japan and the Netherlands, there have been questions about the legal authorities to issue restrictions like the United States, as well as extensive technical discussions about which precise technologies to restrict.', 'Gregory Allen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign governments appeared to be pushing for the agreement to be broadened further, to include countries like South Korea and Germany, to make sure they are not put at a commercial disadvantage by joining with the United States.']"

With stockpiles in the United States strained and American arms makers not yet able to keep up with the pace of Ukraine’s battlefield operations, the Pentagon has turned to two alternative supplies of shells to bridge the gap: one in South Korea and the one in Israel, whose use in the Ukraine war has not been previously reported.', 'The shipment of hundreds of thousands of artillery shells from the two stockpiles to help sustain Ukraine’s war effort is a story about the limits of America’s industrial base and the diplomatic sensitivities of two vital U.S. allies that have publicly committed not to send lethal military aid to Ukraine.', 'Israel has consistently refused to supply weapons to Ukraine out of fear of damaging relations with Moscow and initially expressed concerns about appearing complicit in arming Ukraine if the Pentagon drew its munitions from the stockpile.

Cancian, a former White House weapons strategist, said in a new study for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, where he is a senior adviser.', 'Another analysis published last month by the Foreign Policy Research Institute said that if Ukraine continued to receive a steady supply of ammunition, particularly for artillery, as well as spare parts, it would stand a good chance of wresting back more territory that Russia had seized.', '“The question is whether these advantages will prove sufficient for Ukrainian forces to retake territory from entrenched Russian troops,” wrote Rob Lee and Michael Kofman, leading military analysts.', 'Arming the Ukrainian military with enough artillery ammunition is part of a larger American-led effort to increase its overall combat power by also providing more precision long-range weapons, Western tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and combined arms training.', 'The United States has so far sent or pledged to send Ukraine just over one million 155-millimeter shells.

Yair Lapid, then the prime minister, approved the request at the end of the discussion.', 'The Israeli officials said that Israel had not changed its policy of not providing Ukraine with lethal weapons and rather was acceding to an American decision to use its own ammunition as it saw fit.', '“Based on a U.S. request, certain equipment was transferred to the U.S. D.O.D. from its stockpiles” in Israel, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement, referring to the Department of Defense.', 'The stockpile of American military hardware and munitions in Israel has its origins in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which saw the United States airlifting weapons to resupply Israeli forces.', 'After the war, the United States established warehouses in Israel so that it could rely on them if it were again caught in a crisis. A strategic memorandum signed by the two countries in the 1980s paved the way for the “pre-positioning” of Pentagon assets in Israel, according to two former U.S. officials and a former senior Israeli military officer with direct knowledge of the agreement.', 'American tanks and armored personnel carriers were initially moved to Israel’s southern desert with the understanding that they would be used by U.S. forces in the region if needed, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.', 'In the 2000s, the program was expanded to include munitions for the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force — all stored in separate locations accessible only to American military personnel, according to a former U.S. arms inspector.', 'At the time, the stockpile, officially called the WRSA-I, or War Reserve Stocks for Allies-Israel, was overseen by the U.S. European Command. But it is now managed by the U.S. Central Command, following a redrawing of its area of responsibility in September 2021.', 'Israel was allowed to withdraw American munitions from the stockpile during its war with Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 and again during operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2014, according to a Congressional Research Service report released in February 2022.', 'The Pentagon also approached South Korea last year about transferring munitions in the U.S. stockpile there to Ukraine.', 'The South Koreans were more willing than the Israelis to work with the United States on using the stocks, a senior U.S. official said. But they also objected to shipping artillery shells directly to Ukraine, though for different reasons, the official said. The South Korean government did not want artillery rounds marked R.O.K. (Republic of Korea) showing up in Ukraine in violation of South Korean arms export rules.', 'A compromise was reached. Artillery shells from the Korean stockpile would be sent to replenish American stocks elsewhere.', 'The United States has also agreed to buy 100,000 new artillery shells from South Korea, a deal previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.', 'U.S. officials say that accessing the overseas stocks will help tide over the Ukrainians until American ammunition makers can ramp up their production.', 'Other factors may ease the pressure for more shells. Russia’s artillery fire has reduced sharply in recent weeks, Pentagon officials said, possibly reflecting rationing of rounds because of low supplies. White House officials said in November that North Korea was shipping artillery shells to Russia, another sign of likely munitions shortages, U.S. officials said.', 'Finally, the United States is helping Ukraine use ammunition more efficiently. The Ukrainians have been firing so many artillery barrages that about a third of the 155-millimeter howitzers provided by the United States and other Western nations are out of commission for repairs.', 'Over the summer, during intense fighting between Ukraine and Russia in the eastern region of Donbas, Pentagon officials gathered satellite imagery that showed the devastation wrought on farmland between the two forces’ trench lines. Fields had been transformed into moonscapes, pitted and pocked with thousands of crater shells.', 'Since then, American officials have leaned on Ukrainians to use their artillery more judiciously. And the arrival of precision rocket artillery, like HIMARS rocket artillery, has allowed Ukraine to strike more expertly.']"

Teachers and students press on with resolve.","['KYIV, Ukraine — When the blare of the siren rang out over the loud speaker, the students in a school in central Kyiv quickly rose from their desks, packed their things and filed calmly down the stairs behind their teachers. But this wasn’t a drill.', 'Amid the darkness, huddled in the narrow hallway of their basement shelter, students chatted among themselves. Some used the lights on their smartphones to continue working on classroom assignments.', 'They would remain in the shelter for nearly two hours until the threat of a potential airstrike passed. It is the new reality for the 430 schoolchildren, ages 6 to 18, who still attend classes in person at this large public elementary and high school in Ukraine’s capital. Although classes resumed in September, a relentless barrage of Russian strikes targeting the city since October has crippled the country’s power grid, caused rolling blackouts in Kyiv and offered the latest challenge to education during wartime.', '“We hope this will not last for a long time,” said Olena Romanova, 50, who has been the principal of the school for the last decade. “We also have a generator, but since the school is large, it cannot meet the needs of the entire institution.”', 'Initially, the school struggled to adapt, and some students’ grades faltered, she said, but the school is doing its best to adapt to the new obstacles. Schools across the Ukrainian capital have shuttered for January amid ongoing power cuts, and Ms. Romanova said teachers have been offering extra lessons online to try to keep students up to speed.', 'But a visit to one school in the city in late December, before the winter break, offered a window into the hardships these children need to overcome, and their determination to continue on, with parents and teachers doing what they can to provide the kids with some sense of normalcy.', 'There are normally 850 children enrolled in this school. But in December some classes were only half full, as many students are opting to study online, and some parents believe it’s safer for their children to study from home. Some students are living abroad, after fleeing alongside millions of other Ukrainians, but continue to dial into classes.', 'On the flip side, some new students have joined the classrooms, displaced from battered communities closer to the front lines in Ukraine’s east. The school requested that its exact name be withheld for security and privacy reasons.', 'But few aspects of the education process are untouched by the war. With Russian strikes a constant threat, high school students receive first aid training at school. During last month’s visit, a group of high school girls practiced applying tourniquets and bandages on one another.', 'For now, though, the blackouts remain the most pressing concern.', 'The school’s generator is limited to how much power it can provide, Ms. Romanova said.', '“It’s enough for online classes, it’s enough to keep the lights and internet on,” she said. But it’s not enough to run the school cafeteria, since it uses electric stoves and the generator isn’t powerful enough for them.', 'As the power went out, the hungry students at the school were disappointed when the chef, Olena Sulyma, 42, told them that the food hadn’t arrived yet.', 'She has been working in this cafeteria for years. But lately, she has had to get more creative in how she provides hot meals for the hundreds of students here amid the power outages. She and chefs at other schools nearby that have similar energy issues have been partnering with another local school where there is still electricity.', 'They can cook the meals there and then bring them to their own school.', '“Ukrainians are inventive with things that bother us, that’s why our school chefs try to adapt,” Ms. Romanova said. “So, we adapted and it’s not an issue at the moment, the kids are always full.” ', 'Despite the hardships, many of the students prefer to be in school. One girl, Taisia, 17, said she prefers to be alongside her classmates, even if it meant regular trips to the basement shelter.', '“I can’t stay at home alone,” she said. “But when there is an air alarm and I’m in school, at first I feel calm, but then when I see in the news that something is approaching I feel uneasy and we go to shelter.”', 'Their parents become unsettled as well. While this particular school has not been targeted, a number of educational institutions across Ukraine have been. When the sirens go off, warning of the potential for an incoming strike, many parents rush to pick their children up from school.', 'More than 2,600 educational institutions had been damaged by bombing and shelling, by the last week of December, according to data from the Ukrainian Ministry of Education, and another 406 were completely destroyed. ', 'Maria Lavrynenko is still opting to study online from her home because of her family’s safety concerns.', 'Maria, 17, fled the city with her parents early in the war, relocating to a village farther west. From there she continued her education online, and chose that option when they returned to their home this fall.', 'Each day Maria, who is in the 11th grade, logs on from her family’s apartment in Kyiv at 9 a.m. and continues with her lessons until 3:30 p.m. Then she attends lessons at a rhythmic gymnastics school and hopes to study physical education at university. But rolling power outages have forced her to find creative ways to complete her assignments when the lights flicker off.', '“For me it is very difficult to study, because sometimes there is no electricity and I need to boost my knowledge,” she said, adding that she is preparing for her final exams later this year.', 'Sometimes she heads to a nearby store that has a generator and Wi-Fi and electricity available. On a recent afternoon, as the power at home cut out, she took a photograph of an essay she had just completed and sent it to her teacher using the mobile internet on her phone.', 'Sometimes she drops off her assignments in person. Still, she and her family think it’s best for her to study from home.', '“There are also other reasons for distance learning,” her mother, Maia Lavrynenko, 52, explained. “When there is an air alert in school — everyone goes to the shelter and when you are at home you can continue to study even during the air alert.”', 'Staying at home is no guarantee of tranquillity, though. In early December, there was a drone strike near their home.', '“The whole sky was red, there was dark smoke, everything was black after,” the older Ms. Lavrynenko said. “The house across the road swayed.”', 'Despite all of this, normal life at school carries on. The teachers held a pajama party for the younger students on the last day of school before the start of the winter break. They clutched stuffed animals and giggled in their onesies. The older students also held a holiday party and shared snacks and tea.', 'Ms. Romanova, the principal, said it is important for her to maintain this positivity for in-person schooling. She said she sees it as the personal battle front of every student and every teacher in Ukraine.', '“All of us make our victory closer with our educational achievements,” she said. “We’re here in this moment, and we will be able to overcome it, we will be able to overcome the troubles that fall on our children.”']"

There, he contacted Mr. Osechkin and other human rights activists for help. He moved between cities until his escape to Norway.', 'At one point, in November, he approached Wagner’s headquarters in St. Petersburg and handed his military dog tag to a security guard, a scene captured on video by his companion and uploaded on YouTube.', 'Mr. Medvedev’s own accounts of his life and military service have been contradictory at times, and he has declined to provide evidence for his most explosive claims.', 'Mr. Medvedev, who grew up in a Siberian orphanage and had served at least four years in jail for robbery, said he had witnessed summary executions on the front lines of Wagner fighters accused of cowardice and desertion, as well as dramatic casualty rates suffered by inmate units sent by commanders on suicide missions. The claims have not been independently verified.', 'Two acquaintances of Mr. Medvedev, who have met him since July, have confirmed that he had enlisted in Wagner, but were unable to confirm the details of his service. Their identities are being withheld to protect them against Wagner’s potential retaliation.', 'Mr. Medvedev’s contract with Wagner last year was the third time he had carried out military activities in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, according to people in Ukraine and Russia who met him at the time.

In June, Wimbledon became the only one of the four major tennis tournaments to ban Russian and Belarusian players. The men’s and women’s tennis tours responded by preventing players from collecting points from the tournament that count toward overall rankings.', '“Our initial policy was that fans could bring them in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia, the governing body, said in a statement, referring to the flags. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside.”', 'In line with the Australian government’s policy on Russian and Belarusian athletes, the Australian Open has allowed players from those countries to compete.

But with a new crisis in the Caucasus heating up, Moscow, distracted and weakened by Ukraine, has not intervened.","['In late 2020, when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia brokered the end of a war in the Caucasus between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and placed 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops between the two sides, it looked like a strategic masterstroke.', 'The deal gave Russia a military presence in one post-Soviet country, Azerbaijan, while deepening the reliance of another, Armenia, on Russia as a guarantor of its security. It positioned Mr. Putin as a peacemaker and seemed to affirm his claim to Russia’s rightful influence, as the only power capable of keeping stability throughout the former Soviet sphere.', 'Barely two years later, the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan is heating up again, and Russia, distracted and weakened by the war in Ukraine, has not stepped in. Defying the Russian presence, Azerbaijanis are testing whether Moscow is still able and determined to impose its will on other, smaller neighbors amid its struggles in Ukraine. ', 'Since Dec. 12, the mountain road linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia has been blocked amid protests by Azerbaijani activists claiming to be opposing illegal mining operations in the area. Azerbaijan’s government has endorsed the protests; Armenians say Azerbaijan engineered them and criticize Russian peacekeepers for not keeping the road open.', '“It can be seen that Russia’s resources in the region are becoming limited,” said Farhad Mammadov, a pro-government analyst in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. “Russia is becoming weaker.”', 'The roadblocks are a new escalation in the bloody, decades-old dispute over an enclave home to tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians within Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized borders.', 'In Nagorno-Karabakh, supermarkets are stocked with little but alcohol and candy, and supplies of diapers and basic medicine are so low that residents post on Facebook in search of them, according to Tatev Azizyan, a local journalist. Starting Friday, people will have to present ration cards to buy rice, pasta, buckwheat or sugar.', 'Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reshaped relations around the globe, perhaps nowhere more clearly than on the boundary between Europe and Asia, strengthening the hands of Turkey and Iran, now important sources of trade and weapons for Moscow, while undermining Russian influence in the Caucasus.', 'Armenia is part of the Russian-led military alliance of six post-Soviet countries, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and hosts a Russian military base. But so far, the Kremlin, with its hands full in Ukraine, has not taken action to aid its ally. ', '“The whole concentration of attention on Ukraine makes the situation more fragile and gives a new opportunity to Azerbaijan to use force and be more aggressive,” Vahan Kostanyan, an adviser to   Armenia’s foreign minister, said in a recent interview.', 'Armenia won a war against Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s, giving it control of some 13 percent of Azerbaijan’s total land area, including Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan won much of it back when it launched an offensive in 2020, taking advantage of its natural gas profits to buy superior weaponry from Turkey and Israel.', 'The recent war ended after 44 days with the cease-fire negotiated by Mr. Putin, and Russian troops were deployed to protect the Armenians remaining in and around Stepanakert, the region’s biggest city, and the road connecting it to Armenia.', 'Now, some Armenians believe, Azerbaijan is intent on starving them out with the roadblocks. “This is so that we leave our homeland,” Ms. Azizyan, the journalist in Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh, said in a phone interview. “That is their goal.”', 'President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan said last week that “whoever does not want to become our citizen, the road is not closed; it is open. They can leave whenever they want.”', 'Russia’s leverage is waning in both countries. In Azerbaijan, the Ukraine invasion turned public opinion further against Russia and its peacekeeping contingent, said Zaur Shiriyev, a Crisis Group analyst in Baku. In Armenia, Russia’s military support looks less advantageous, with Russia no longer a prolific exporter of weaponry — it needs it in Ukraine — and with Mr. Putin keen to preserve close ties with Turkey, Azerbaijan’s main ally.', 'Tigran Grigoryan, an Armenian political analyst, said the war in Ukraine had “created an environment in which the Russian deterrent isn’t working in the region.”', 'There is little clarity on how the current crisis can be resolved. Azerbaijan insists it has not imposed a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh, and that humanitarian and medical traffic is being let through. But on the ground, the situation appears increasingly dire for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh who are stranded with limited food and other essentials, and cut off from family members who were in Armenia when the crisis began.', 'Ms. Azizyan said she recently braved a six-hour line at an A.T.M., and that things as simple as oranges, cheese or fever-reducing drugs have become prized possessions. Kindergartens are closed, she said, because of a lack of food.', 'After Russian peacekeeping troops were filmed recently handing out humanitarian aid outside a local maternity clinic, residents split into two camps on social media, she said: some thanked the Russians, while others asked why they weren’t doing more.', '“No one understands,” Ms. Azizyan said, why Russia is not able to reopen the road. “People have started to get angry and to express their indignation toward the peacekeepers.”', 'While Azerbaijan won the 2020 war, it still has not achieved all its aims, including a transportation corridor to the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan, a separate slice of Azerbaijani territory on Armenia’s southwestern border, that would give the country a direct link to Turkey. It is also seeking to exert greater control over the road that is now being blocked, known as the Lachin Corridor, claiming that Armenia is using it to illegally transport land mines into the territory.', 'Russia has been trying to tread a middle path amid the escalation. While Armenia is a military ally, Mr. Aliyev has developed a close relationship with Mr. Putin, and both countries are important economic partners for Russia amid Western sanctions.', '“We call on the Azerbaijani and Armenian sides to demonstrate good will and to seek compromises together,” Maria V. Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, said last week.', 'The Kremlin continues to keep a hand in the negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and Mr. Putin spoke with Mr. Aliyev and with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia in December in St. Petersburg. In televised remarks at his meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Pashinyan noted with apparent frustration that “it turns out that the Lachin Corridor is not under the control of Russian peacekeepers.”', 'Last week, Mr. Pashinyan went further in pushing back against Moscow, canceling planned military drills in Armenia this year by the Russia-led alliance.', '“Russia’s military presence in Armenia not only fails to guarantee its security, but it raises security threats for Armenia,” Mr. Pashinyan said, according to The Associated Press.', 'But analysts say that there is little chance that Armenia will be able to disentangle itself from its reliance on Russia anytime soon — the latest in a series of lessons for post-Soviet countries about the difficulty of moving out of Moscow’s security shadow, especially when instability threatens. In Belarus in 2020 and Kazakhstan last year, leaders of former Soviet countries turned to Mr. Putin for help in the face of popular uprisings, reinforcing his sway over both nations.', '“Armenia has a massive strategic problem,” said Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe who has studied the conflict for decades. Mr. Pashinyan “would like a much more balanced foreign policy, and yet he’s stuck with Russia as his main military-political ally.”', 'Still, with Moscow distracted, the European Union and the United States have heightened their own efforts to broker a lasting peace and to build their influence in the Caucasus. Mr. Pashinyan and Mr. Aliyev met last August and last October in meetings arranged by the European Union, and the two countries’ foreign ministers met in Washington in November.', 'Analysts described the dual negotiating tracks as unusual — one led by Russia, the other by the E.U., at a time when Moscow and the West are locked in their most intense conflict in decades. But the E.U.’s special representative for the southern Caucasus, Toivo Klaar, said in an interview that he has been in contact with his Russian counterpart, the diplomat Igor Khovayev, and held two in-person meetings with him last fall.', '“In the current circumstances there’s potentially more space for Armenia and Azerbaijan to actually overcome their conflict,” Mr. Klaar said. “The question is whether they’re able to seize that opportunity.”']"

This makes the underlying conflict so difficult to resolve that fighting often recurs repeatedly over many decades.', 'Those wars have often turned, perhaps more than any other factor, on industrial attrition, as each side strains to maintain the flow of matériel like tanks and antiaircraft munitions that keep it in the fight.', 'But this works very differently from the competition over raw manpower that defined conflicts like World War I, touching more on matters of technology, economic capacity and international diplomacy.', '“A lot of conventional wars come down to attrition,” the analyst Michael Kofman said recently on the national security podcast War on the Rocks. “The side that is better able to reconstitute over time is the side that’s able to sustain the war and ultimately win.”', 'The conflict between Russia and Ukraine neatly fits that model, which helps to explain many of its twists and turns, added Mr. Kofman, who is the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va.', 'To take one example, each side’s ability to take and hold territory is determined in large part by its ability to field tanks and other heavy vehicles more reliably than its opponent.', 'And, because air power is effective at destroying such vehicles, each side’s rate of attrition on the ground is determined in part by who controls the skies.', 'This is consistent with other such wars. Some analysts argue that Iran ended its decade-long war with Iraq, in the 1980s, only when it finally wrested control of the skies.', 'By the same token, the question of who controls the skies is determined in large part by whether Ukraine can field enough anti-air weaponry to keep pace with Russia’s ability to field aircraft. That is a question of attrition, too — though one that is as much economic and diplomatic as it is military.', 'This helps explain why Ukraine, whose production could hardly keep pace even before Russia began bombing its factories, has focused so much on winning Western military aid; why Western governments have focused so tightly on constraining Russia’s economy; and why Russian forces have launched so many strikes on Ukrainian cities — which both degrades Ukrainian industry, down to even the functioning of its electrical grid, as well as forces Ukraine to relocate some air defenses from the front lines to cities far removed from the battlefield.', 'All of these, on some level, are fronts in the war of industrial attrition. This, too, parallels other such wars, for instance the Korean War, in which U.S.-led air attacks devastated North Korean cities in a manner not unlike, and often exceeding, Russia’s strike campaign in Ukraine.', 'One lesson of those conflicts is that, as each side grows desperate to keep pace with the other, it goes to ever-greater lengths to win international support.', 'That can prolong the war when it favors the aggressor, as did American and Saudi support for Iraq’s attempted invasion of Iran. It can help decide the war’s outcome, as happened in some conflicts amid the breakup of Yugoslavia, where Western support for one side ultimately exceeded Russian support for the other. It can also reshape global politics more broadly. The geopolitical lines set by the Korean War, in which the North won Soviet and Chinese support against the U.S.-backed South, are still largely in place 70 years later.', '“The Yom Kippur War comes to mind,” Dr. Radchenko, the historian, said of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, referring to the Arab-Israeli war of 1973.', 'The coalition of Arab states that attacked Israel sought to eject it from territory it had seized in prior rounds of fighting and re-establish their regional dominance, much as Moscow is seeking to reimpose Ukraine within its orbit and, more broadly, reconstitute some of its Soviet-era power within Europe.', 'In his speech announcing the invasion, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president, even described it as a war to reverse what he considered to be the historical error, amid the Soviet Union’s breakup 30 years earlier, that established Ukraine as an independent state.', 'This, too, parallels the Arab coalition’s repeated wars with Israel, which date to that country’s declaration of independence in 1948, on territory the Arab states considered to be rightfully Palestine. The most recent war between Israel and one of those states was in 2006, marking 58 years of conflict. Formal peace with several of those countries was declared only in the last few years, and tensions still remain at a low boil with others.', 'This pattern holds across many of the conventional wars since World War II: a conflict over territory and power balance that began with the declaration of those modern states and that has flared intermittently ever since.', 'Armenia and Azerbaijan, for instance, two countries that also emerged out of the Soviet Union’s breakup, have fought periodic wars ever since, broken by long but tense cease-fires. India and Pakistan fought their first war within months of their independence and partition in 1947, followed by three more wars, most recently in 1999, and repeated lower-level conflicts now held at a tentative nuclear peace. North and South Korea reached an armistice in 1953 but remain in a technical state of war with occasional flare-ups and an ever-present threat of all-out fighting.', 'Such conflicts, in other words, have often persisted for as many as six or seven decades. With peace talks minimal or nonexistent in many cases, some may well continue longer than that.', 'And while outright fighting may be infrequent, with whatDr. Radchenko termed “active phases” lasting only a few months, periods of calm typically require deep international involvement to maintain. American troops, for instance, have been garrisoned in South Korea for more than 70 years.', 'It is impossible to predict whether this represents the future for Russia and Ukraine, though it perhaps already describes their present state. The seven years before Russia’s 2022 invasion were marked by lower-level fighting, with heavy Western diplomacy and support to Ukraine aimed at forestalling wider conflict.', 'This pattern shows that one side rarely vanquishes the other outright, especially with foreign states ready to step in. And it offers another lesson: Political change within those countries rarely provides the sort of breakthrough that observers are hoping might one day lead Moscow to pull back. The decade-long Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for instance, only deepened with the elevation, in 1985, of the reform-minded leader Mikhail Gorbachev.', 'That Russia and Ukraine’s war would seem to fit an old pattern at all, rather than charting a new direction in warfare, as had been widely predicted, may offer wider lessons for the world.', '“Strategic weapons have not replaced and will not replace armies,” Stephanie Carvin, a Canadian analyst, wrote in an essay on the trajectory of warfare that has circulated widely among experts.', 'Conventional forces alone can seize and hold territory, making them the central unit of warfare. Newer technology like drones or satellite communications have not altered that dynamic, nor have new methods such as cyberattacks or media manipulation.', '“There’s no doubt that ways of waging wars have evolved since the time of Clausewitz with the introduction of new technologies,” Dr. Radchenko said, referring to the Prussian general from the 18th and 19th centuries credited with modern military theory.', 'But, over and over, he added, what might initially “get called a ‘revolution’ in military affairs actually plays out as fairly slow changes.”', 'But by the same token, Dr. Carvin wrote in her essay, “Weapons can help produce cease-fires, but they cannot themselves create long-lasting, established peace.”', 'Despite many attempts by large and small military powers alike to develop methods of warfare effective enough to force their political goals on their adversary, none has yet found a way to sidestep the hard work of negotiating a mutually acceptable peace.', 'But a lesson of the past 80 years of warfare may be that if states are unable to come to terms — perhaps, as with the case of Russia’s attitude toward Ukraine, because one side sees the other’s very independence as intolerable — then even fighting to a state of mutual exhaustion might not bring peace.']"

The chancellor had repeatedly defended the record of Ms. Lambrecht, a former justice minister and a fellow member of his party, the Social Democrats.', '“The monthslong media focus on me as a person hardly allows for objective reporting and discussion about the servicemen and women, the German armed forces and security policy decisions in the interest of the citizens of Germany,” Ms. Lambrecht said in a statement released on Monday morning.', 'Since taking up the post when Mr. Scholz’s government entered office last year, Ms. Lambrecht had been dogged by criticism. She had no previous experience of the military and opposition leaders accused her of lacking interest in heading the Defense Ministry. According to Germany’s best-selling daily, Bild, Ms. Lambrecht had been unable to name the different ranks of the German military in an interview with the paper.', 'Ms. Lambrecht began facing public scorn at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As Germany debated sending weapons to Kyiv in the early days of the invasion, Ms. Lambrecht trumpeted a delivery of 5,000 helmets. She was the face of the government’s repeated foot-dragging over sending weapons, though it is likely she was carrying out a policy largely driven by the chancellery.', 'Criticism ramped up last summer when it emerged that Ms. Lambrecht had used a government helicopter to take her son on a family vacation.', 'More recently, opposition parties in Germany have argued Ms. Lambrecht is responsible for the slow rollout of a 100 billion euro ($108 billion) defense fund, part of a plan by the government to significantly bolster its military in response to the war in Ukraine. Germany’s limited stores of basic ammunition mean it has stocks for only hours or days of combat.', 'The final straw appears to have been an awkward video released on New Year’s Eve on Ms. Lambrecht’s personal Instagram account. In it, Ms. Lambrecht discussed the war in Ukraine and offered seasonal greetings amid a raucous backdrop of fireworks in Berlin. Critics called it distasteful, and even her own ministry distanced itself from the video, saying it was a personal statement.', 'In her statement, Ms. Lambrecht said that she hoped her resignation would put the public focus back where it belonged. “The valuable work of the soldiers and the many motivated people in the area of operations must be in the foreground,” she said.', 'A successor has not been announced.', '']"

But her parents, she wrote on a verified account on Instagram, were still missing. And her partner, who was serving in the Ukrainian military, was killed in action four months ago.', 'The strike on Saturday at an ordinary, nine-story residential building led to one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war, and it prompted renewed calls for Moscow to be charged with war crimes. In an address to Ukrainians on Sunday night, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was also critical to punish “those who grease the Russian propaganda machine.”', 'He offered a warning to Russian citizens in their own language: “Your cowardly silence, your attempt to ‘wait out’ what is happening will only end with those same terrorists coming after you one day.”', ' It is considered a war crime to deliberately or recklessly attack civilian populations or places where civilians would be likely to congregate, but Moscow has paid little heed to the international rules of war.', 'The assault on Dnipro was hardly the first time a Ukrainian population center far from the front lines — including the city itself — had been targeted since Russia invaded in February. Russian strikes on train stations, theaters, shopping malls and residential neighborhoods have led to significant loss of civilian life, as has the shelling of cities and towns near the front line.', 'But images of the devastation in the central city of Dnipro provoked anger and despair among Ukrainians, and the attack appeared to be part of a return to old tactics.', 'In recent months, Moscow has turned the focus of its assault on infrastructure targets that provide power, heat and water, apparently hoping to demoralize the country. But for reasons that remain unclear, over the weekend, Russia launched dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year and shattered the relative calm of recent days.', 'The missile that struck the building in Dnipro appeared to have been a Kh-22 cruise missile, also known as an X-22 missile, according to Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense. She said it was one of five of them fired at Ukrainian territory that day.', 'The Soviet-era missiles weigh about 2,000 pounds, can be fired from long distances and are intended for anti-ship operations. They are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads.', 'Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said the Kh-22 missile that appears to have hit Dnipro could have been launched by only one Russian unit, the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment.', '“This type of missile leads to the greatest human casualties, because the missile is extremely inaccurate,” the office said. “Therefore, the use of such weapons for targets in densely populated areas is clearly a war crime.”', 'More than 210 missiles of that type have been used in attacks on Ukrainian territory since Russia invaded, including a strike on a shopping center in Kremenchuk in June that killed 18 people.', 'Immediately after the Dnipro attack, pro-Russian news outlets and influential military bloggers claimed that the apartment building was not the target, but had been struck by fragments of the missile after Ukrainian air defenses tried to intercept it. But Ukrainian forces were quick to deny that, and the evidence from the scene pointed to a direct strike on the building.', '“The Armed Forces of Ukraine have no weapons capable of shooting down this type of missile,” Ms. Maliar said.', 'In fact, she said, the attack showed the need for antiaircraft missile systems like the Patriot system that Ukraine has long been lobbying its allies for. The United States and Germany have agreed to supply Ukraine with the Patriot system, and Ukrainian forces are to begin training on it in Oklahoma in the coming week.', 'Dnipro, a city nestled against the river of the same name, had a population of just under one million before the war began. After Moscow invaded, it was targeted by Russian shelling but never occupied by its forces, and never the scene of frontline fighting. The city has been home to displaced people who have flocked to its relative safety.', 'Even so, Dnipro has been intermittently targeted by missile strikes, and since October, when the Russian assault on infrastructure stepped up, a number have struck the city.', 'On Sunday, neighbors gathered at the site of the latest attack, looking on in disbelief. Less than 24 hours earlier, the area had been untouched.', 'Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said 72 apartments had been destroyed. The explosion also shattered the windows of surrounding buildings, leaving many more people displaced. Plastic sheeting had been taped over some windows blown out by the explosion, and workers were measuring others so that glass could be reinstalled.', 'By late afternoon, as firefighters searched the rubble for survivors, the air was filled with the sounds of cranes and crunching glass. Dump trucks rolled in and out of the area, collecting debris and clearing the streets surrounding the partly collapsed building.', 'A humanitarian tent city had sprung up, with volunteers making sandwiches and distributing tea and coffee to the hundreds of rescuers and residents on the scene. One tent had mattresses, blankets and tarps. Some people huddled around open bonfires for warmth in the frozen air.', 'Some residents of damaged buildings were waiting to get the go-ahead so they could collect their belongings.

With no windows in the bitter cold, it was impossible to stay.', 'More than 550 people were involved in the rescue operation, according to local officials.', 'As the 24-hour mark approached, at least one person, a 27-year-old woman, was pulled alive from the debris. She was taken to a hospital and was being treated for severe hypothermia, local officials said.', 'Mr. Zelensky said reports had been coming in from Dnipro all day.', '“We are fighting for every person,” he said. “The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save lives.”']"

They dragged bronze statues from parks, lifted books from a riverside scientific library, boxed up the crumbling, 200-year-old bones of Grigory Potemkin, Catherine the Great’s lover, and even stole a raccoon from the zoo, leaving behind a trail of vacant cages, empty pedestals and smashed glass.', 'Ukrainian officials say that Russian forces have robbed or damaged more than 30 museums — including several in Kherson, which was retaken in November, and others in Mariupol and Melitopol, which remain under Russian occupation. With Ukrainian investigators still cataloging the losses of missing oil paintings, ancient steles, bronze pots, coins, necklaces and busts, the number of reported stolen items is likely to grow.', 'The plundering is hardly a case of random or opportunistic misbehavior by a few ill-behaved troops, Ukrainian officials and international experts say, or even a desire to turn a quick profit on the black market. Instead, they believe the thefts are a broadside attack on Ukrainian pride, culture and identity, consistent with the imperial attitude of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has constantly belittled the idea of Ukraine as a separate nation and used that as a central rationale for his invasion.', '“It’s not like one soldier putting a silver chalice in his rucksack,” said James Ratcliffe, general counsel of The Art Loss Register, a London-based organization that traces stolen art. “This is a far, far larger scale.”', 'At one museum in Melitopol, a southern Ukrainian city that the Russians seized in the first days of the war, witnesses said that a mysterious man in a white lab coat had arrived to carefully extract, with gloves and tweezers, the most valuable objects from the collection, including gold pieces from the Scythian empire crafted 2,300 years ago. As he lifted out the priceless antiquities, a squad of Russian soldiers stood firmly behind him, in case anyone should try to stop him.', 'In each case of looting, witnesses — including caretakers, security guards and other museum employees, who said they had been pressured or forced to help — reported a centrally controlled expert-led operation.', '“Shocked is not the word.

He said his museum was keeping the collection for its own “protection.”', '(Russian soldiers similarly displayed the four-legged booty they had “liberated” from Kherson’s zoo.

The Ukrainian military said its troops were still holding onto parts of the town, but that Russia had deployed significant forces in the area and that the situation was dynamic.', 'Although taking control of the town would provide Russia with new positions for artillery facing the nearby city of Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months, analysts say Soledar itself has little strategic value and is unlikely to significantly change the battle for eastern Ukraine.', 'The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said on Thursday night that geo-located footage indicated that Moscow’s forces “likely control most if not all of Soledar,” but said capture of the town was “at best a Russian Pyrrhic tactical victory,” gained at a steep cost.', 'Most of Soledar has been reduced to shattered buildings, jagged rubble and shell craters, and most of its prewar population of about 10,000 has fled. But after months of Russian military setbacks — a chaotic collapse in the northeast in September, a retreat from a major city in the south in November, and heavy losses in the east all the while — Russian military leaders appeared to view the town as a symbolic prize worth competing for.', 'The public quarrel between Wagner and the Russian military highlighted the deep rifts and disorganization that have plagued Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since it began almost a year ago. Late Friday, the Russian military appeared to try to patch up the dispute by issuing a second statement, this one with a rare statement of public praise for the Wagner fighters.', 'In the statement, the Defense Ministry said it needed to “clarify” that a “heterogeneous” group had worked together in Soledar. The direct assault of city blocks, the ministry said, “was accomplished with the courageous and selfless actions of the Wagner PMC volunteer assault troops.”', 'The founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has for months taken a greater prominence in Russia’s war efforts, recruiting prisoners to join his troops, deploying his own fighter jets and tanks, and openly denigrating and taunting Russian generals.

On Wednesday, he was named one of Mr. Gerasimov’s deputies.', 'The shake-up probably reflected systemic issues in the Russian military, Brig. Gen. Patrick S.

With a new Russian offensive expected, officials see an urgent need to shift the balance.","['Western officials increasingly fear that Ukraine has only a narrow window to prepare to repel an anticipated Russian springtime offensive, and are moving fast to give the Ukrainians sophisticated weapons they had earlier refused to send for fear of provoking Moscow.', 'Over the last few weeks, one barrier after another has fallen, starting with an agreement by the United States in late December to send a Patriot air-defense system. That was followed by a German commitment last week to provide a Patriot missile battery, and in the span of hours, France, Germany and the United States each promised to send armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine’s battlefields for the first time.', 'Now it looks likely that modern Western tanks will be added to the growing list of powerful weapons being sent Ukraine’s way, as the United States and its allies take on more risk to defend Ukraine — especially as its military has made unexpected advances and held out against withering assaults.', 'While Ukraine has been requesting sophisticated tanks since the start of the war, the push to satisfy those pleas gained speed this week as the British and Polish governments publicly urged a change in the Western alliance’s stance. The British signaled that they were close to agreeing to send a small number of tanks, and the Polish government said it would happily send some of its German-made tanks, though Berlin would need to allow it.', 'Ukraine hopes that the increased pressure will persuade Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz to authorize the export to Ukraine of German-made tanks in the arsenals of other NATO allies. The tanks, called the Leopard 2’s, are among the most coveted by Kyiv, and experts say that in significant numbers, they would substantially increase Ukraine’s ability to drive back Russian forces.', '“Somebody always has to set an example,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told the Polish state-run broadcaster TVP Info on Thursday.', 'A German defense ministry spokesman said no decision had been made by the government of Mr. Scholz, a Social Democrat.

Armed with large cannons, moving on metal treads and built with stronger protective armor than any other weapon on a battlefield, tanks can go over rough, muddy or sandy terrain where wheeled fighting vehicles might struggle.', 'In Ukraine, officials say armored vehicles will play a key role in battles for control of the fiercely contested towns and cities in the eastern provinces that border Russia. Ukraine’s most senior military commander, General Valery Zaluzhny, has said it needs some 300 Western tanks and about 600 Western armored fighting vehicles to make a difference.', 'The sense of urgency over sending more powerful weapons partly reflects the grim standoff on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, where for months the Russians have tried to seize the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area, suffering heavy casualties but gaining little ground. In the past week, the fighting has been especially brutal in the nearby town of Soledar, going block to block and house to house, with conflicting claims about control of the town.', 'NATO allies that were once part of the Soviet sphere have given their Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine. But much of Kyiv’s fleet has been destroyed or worn down by months of battle, and it is running low on ammunition, which is incompatible with Western munitions.', 'Since the war began nearly a year ago, the West has resisted giving some of its most potent weapons to Ukraine, fearing that would bring NATO into direct conflict with Russia. But seeing Ukraine’s determination to resist, little prospect of peace talks anytime soon, and a stalemate on the battlefield, NATO allies are relenting.', 'The Patriots they recently agreed to are the most advanced American-made air defense system and will help protect Kyiv and other densely populated areas from Russian strikes that have crippled Ukraine’s electricity grid. The armored fighting vehicles approved last week are lighter and easier to maneuver on the battlefield than tanks and can carry more troops, but are not as powerful.', 'There are still some weapons not yet being considered, including fighter jets and longer-range missiles that could hit occupied Crimea and Russia itself. The Biden administration, leading the coalition of allies supplying Ukraine with weapons, is still holding back American-made M1 Abrams tanks, which require constant upkeep and special fuel, and which officials say are too scarce to spare.', 'But American officials maintain they have never stood in the way of Germany or any other nation sending Western tanks to Ukraine. There are an estimated 2,000 German-made Leopard tanks in more than a dozen militaries across Europe. Some could be shipped quickly to Ukraine if Berlin approved, though Ukrainian crews would have to be trained in using them.', 'A senior Western military official said this week that altering the balance of forces in eastern Ukraine is needed to break the stalemate in the war, and that sending in enough modern Western battle tanks and other combat vehicles could help to tip that balance. Without tanks, a powerful component of ground warfare, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to win back significant amounts of territory, the official said.', 'At the Pentagon, Laura K.

Russia, too, is telegraphing a spring offensive, said a senior Western intelligence official, and Ukraine “doesn’t want them to catch their breath” between now and when that intensified round of combat begins.', 'Camille Grand, a defense expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who stepped down as NATO’s assistant secretary general for defense investment late last year, noted that Moscow appears to be mobilizing hundreds of thousands of new conscripts for its offensive. That, in part, pushed forward the debate about tanks, he said, “to enable the Ukrainian forces to achieve significant progress now.”', 'Part of the discussion, Mr. Grand said, focused on whether the tanks would give Ukrainian forces “some sort of a decisive victory that would force peace on the Russians, or at least to achieve such significant progress that any negotiated settlement would be more on their terms than on Russian terms.”', 'The issue of whether to allow Leopards to be sent to Ukraine is likely to come to a head at a Jan. 20 meeting of senior defense and military officials from dozens of nations, including NATO states, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.', 'Britain has so far said it is considering sending as few as 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. Britain has about 227 Challengers, which have maintenance issues, and it would be hard-pressed to replenish its stocks.', 'Part of the internal debate among British officials is political, a senior European diplomat said. Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister, wants to take some leadership in the war, and London and Warsaw appear to be acting in concert to put pressure on Berlin. In a closed-door session of his National Security Council on Tuesday, Mr. Sunak outlined a strategy to increase support for Ukraine, likely beginning with the tanks, to give Kyiv an edge ahead of any possible peace negotiations, according to another senior European official.', 'But Washington’s explicit approval would be vital to pushing Mr. Scholz to authorize the Leopards, as it was crucial to the decision to send the German-made fighting vehicles known as Marders, said Claudia Major, a defense analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.', '“Pressure on the Leopards is rising from the Poles, the British and the Finns, but it’s about one particular partner, the United States, which is more equal than the others,” she said. “With the Ramstein meeting coming, I expect it to happen soon.”', 'A senior Biden administration official said Washington had not prodded Berlin to send the tanks to Ukraine, and that the German government would make its own decisions about its level of military support. Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue more candidly, he described the discussions between Washington and Berlin as “very active” and said the Germans, “like us, have evolved their willingness to provide capabilities as the fight has changed over time.” The United States has not told allies to refrain from giving Western tanks to Ukraine, the official said.', 'The Germans regard such a stance as a cop-out, according to Ms. Major, the analyst in Berlin, reflecting Washington’s own unwillingness to send any Abrams tanks to Ukraine. She has said that just one Abrams from Washington would be enough to free Mr. Scholz to act.', 'For now, supporters of sending tanks are focused on getting some country to make the first move.', 'Norbert Röttgen, an opposition German legislator and foreign-policy expert, predicted that Mr. Scholz would give in on the Leopards under pressure from allies, as he did earlier with German-made howitzers and tracked armored infantry fighting vehicles.', 'Mr. Scholz and his party “want to keep a relationship with Russia and with Putin for the future, and thinks that if he gives Ukraine the best Germany has, Russia will perceive this as breaking a special relationship,” Mr. Röttgen said. “But pressure from allies is becoming too strong.”']"

He has been indicted in the United States, where he is accused of orchestrating Russian online meddling in the 2016 presidential election.', 'This year, Mr. Prigozhin has cast off the modest profile he once tried to maintain.', 'After long denying any role in election meddling, he recently boasted of it. He has criticized the regular military. And, after saying for years that he had no connection to Wagner — he even questioned whether it existed — he acknowledged in September that he was its founder, and has embraced its role in Ukraine.', 'Mr. Prigozhin has supplemented Russia’s decimated fighting ranks with tens of thousands of prison inmates recruited to his mercenary force, awarded medals, visited military cemeteries and, according to his frequent videos, appeared unexpectedly at the toughest sections of the front line.', 'In late December, Wagner fighters released a profanity-laden video addressed to the military high command, accusing it of withholding ammunition and causing the deaths of their comrades.

The authorities in Ukraine had captured him in April after he fled house arrest while awaiting trial on treason charges in a case initiated last year.', 'His influence in Ukraine was such that his name surfaced in the U.S. investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 American elections. Mr. Medvedchuk was a client of Paul J. Manafort, the Republican political consultant who advised pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians before becoming chairman of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an overnight speech late Tuesday that the decision to end Mr. Medvedchuk’s citizenship was based on a report by the country’s security services. “If people’s deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate,” Mr. Zelensky said.', 'Russia’s invasion has made national survival the overriding focus of Ukraine’s politics, and, as a result, has closed the space for agents of Moscow’s influence who for decades have played a role in Ukraine’s internal affairs.', 'Last spring, Ukraine seized some of Mr. Medvedchuk’s vast wealth, which had been amassed through energy deals with the Kremlin while he worked in support of Russian interests in Ukraine and beyond.', 'Mr. Zelensky said that the state had also stripped citizenship from three others: Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak and Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin. All three were at onetime members of Ukraine’s Parliament and served pro-Russian interests.', 'Mr. Medvedchuk was handed over to Russia in September alongside Russian pilots and senior military officials in exchange for more than 200 Ukrainian fighters.

Yet the Russian economy performed above expectations, buoyed by high commodity prices.

The government has financed the deficit by issuing bonds and using money from its rainy-day fund.', 'A high deficit is likely for this year, too.

But what seems clear is that short of a Russian collapse and defeat, with Ukraine winning back all of its territory, any security guarantees are likely to be both partial and fragile.', 'But without something, officials and analysts suggest, it is hard to imagine investors pouring back into Ukraine to rebuild the country — or that another war would not flare in the future.', 'Much pivots on the hesitancy of the West itself, which wants to protect Ukraine but has shown that it does not want to fight for it, and that it does not want a direct military confrontation with Russia. Instead it has sought to thread a course between deterring Russia but not provoking it.', 'There will be “a lot of risks around the corner for European and trans-Atlantic unity,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome. If Ukraine manages to regain even the territory lost since Russia’s invasion last year, she said, then there would be mounting voices in Europe and Washington saying, “Look at the ongoing costs, civilian and military — hey, compromise.”', 'But Ukraine will want solid security commitments in return, she said, and that could divide the West — with Central and Eastern European countries demanding NATO membership for Ukraine, and Western European allies refusing.', 'While NATO and the European Union have promised Ukraine membership, there is no deadline, and it is not certain those pledges will be fulfilled. The West’s embrace of Ukraine was one reason cited by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his invasion in the first place.', 'As long as territorial disputes remain, there is little likelihood that even a Ukraine in some sort of cease-fire agreement with Russia would win the unanimous support needed to join either institution.', 'How the war ends will be crucial, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, who helped write a paper detailing the knotty issues involved in Ukraine’s reconstruction.', 'Even before last year’s invasion, he noted, Ukraine’s sovereignty was already compromised by Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The neatest outcome now would be if Ukraine won back all of its lost territory, though that is far from certain.', '“If it’s a complete Russian defeat, then you solve the Crimea problem and you have a different Russia,” he said. NATO membership would then be easier to envision for Ukraine and it would create a kind of untouchability, even by another revisionist Russian leader, he said. “But the price to get to total victory is very high, and then what?”', 'The prospect of a complete defeat of Russia, which could undermine Mr. Putin and his circle, embodies risks of Russian escalation that many NATO country leaders, including President Biden, seem unwilling to hazard.', 'Should Mr. Putin’s leadership collapse, key European states like France and Germany worry about what a chaotic, nuclear-armed Russia could portend, and even about a return to a “time of troubles,” the years of lawlessness, infighting and anarchy that Russia experienced at the start of the 17th century.', 'But anything short of NATO membership would involve promises that Kyiv already considers hollow. Those were tried before, in 1994, when the United States, Britain and Russia itself promised Ukraine territorial integrity and security “assurances” in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons under an agreement called the Budapest Memorandum.', 'Those assurances came with no commitments — from Russia, of course, but also from Washington and London — and proved worthless.', 'Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former NATO secretary-general, has tried to square the circle in “The Kyiv Security Compact,” a proposal he and his colleagues drafted in the autumn with Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.', 'It aims to provide something workable between the hollow assurances of 1994 and full NATO and E.U. membership. The core recommendation is for Ukraine’s allies to turn the country into a kind of hedgehog or a porcupine, one so well-armed that Russia would not try to swallow it again.', 'To get there, it urges a “strategic partnership” between Ukraine and key Western countries, on a bilateral basis, for a “multi-decade effort” to make Ukraine impregnable and capable of its own defense.', 'Mr. Rasmussen has compared his proposal to the relationship between the United States and Israel, with lots of defense cooperation but no formal defense treaty.', 'In essence, the proposal is alliance without membership, less a security guarantee to Ukraine than a major disincentive to Moscow.', '“The irony is that non-membership in NATO would require more of the West than membership, and for longer,” said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff.', 'Others suggest that individual allies, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Poland, put their own troops into Ukraine postwar, the way NATO has put forward-based multinational brigades into NATO members states that border Russia.', 'But significant troop presence in a non-NATO member would be seen in Moscow as a further provocation and more evidence to fit Russia’s narrative that NATO is trying to rip Ukraine away from the Russian sphere.', 'As Ben Hodges, a retired general who commanded the U.S. Army Europe points out, the United States, Canada and other countries had troops in Ukraine, training the Ukrainian army, right up until Russia’s invasion, when they were withdrawn to avoid a NATO-Russian confrontation. “What would be their mission?” he asked.', 'Mr. Hodges believes that Ukraine, with the right longer-range weapons from a currently reluctant Washington, can defeat Russia and take back all occupied territory, including Crimea, by the end of August.', '“There is no way Ukraine will be safe and secure so long as Russia controls Crimea,” he said. Crimea allows Russia to block the Sea of Azov, isolate Mariupol, hit Odesa and dominate the Black Sea, while claiming an exclusive economic zone around Crimea, limiting fishing and gas exploration, he said.', 'The only real security guarantee for Ukraine is eventual NATO membership, Mr. Hodges argued. But whatever the outcome, he said, “it must be based on the assumption that Russia won’t respect it unless they’re forced to.”', '“Russia cannot be rewarded and think that what they did has paid off with territorial gain or leverage,” he said.', 'But for many, like Camille Grand, a former NATO assistant secretary-general now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, it remains likely the war will end with Russia having “achieved partial objectives.” A full defeat of Russia and Ukraine joining NATO “is only one scenario, and an optimistic one,” he said.', 'While anything short of NATO membership “would be difficult to sell to the Ukrainians,” he said, Russia would assume in its war plans that Ukraine would be effectively part of NATO, much as it has always done with Sweden and Finland.', 'A post-conflict Ukraine “would provide NATO the best-equipped, best-trained and most capable army in Europe — in a way providing NATO security guarantees,” not the other way around, he said.', 'In a way, the whole idea of security guarantees is outdated, said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat in Russia and former ambassador to NATO.', 'The only real guarantee of Ukrainian security is NATO membership, he said, however complicated. Security guarantees from major countries would be tantamount to NATO membership in any case, he said, and would inevitably carry risks when put to the test.', 'Even now, individual NATO countries refuse to send troops to aid Ukraine militarily, so why would they do so in the future? he asked.', 'One could imagine a settlement now where Ukraine loses part of its territory, and a later Kyiv government provokes Russia in order to get it back and then seeks to drag these guarantors into a conflict. What would they do then?', '“Even if Ukraine gains NATO membership, it’s a defensive alliance and comes with restraints,” Mr. Stefanini said.', 'Still, he said, it would be a mistake to underestimate the cynical creativity of diplomats. One could arrive at a point where negotiations produce a commitment for Ukrainian neutrality, but not disarmament, with language about security guarantees, “even if anyone not a politician would call them unrealistic,” he said.', 'He made the comparison to the Dayton Accords that concluded the Bosnian war, “an awkward acrobatic architecture that only served to end the war.” Even this war will end, he said, and probably in negotiations.', '“Total victory for anyone seems unlikely,” he said. So at some point, the diplomats will have to get creative, providing Ukraine some solid prospect of peace and security somehow underwritten by its allies.']"

Another enemy assault was underway in the eastern city of Bakhmut.', 'The drone pilot marked coordinates as he watched, then sent them by satellite link to artillery commanders.', 'Within a few minutes, Ukrainian artillery units struck the houses where they had seen the Russians taking cover. Smoke from the hits could be seen rising silently on the drone operator’s screen.', 'Later that day, however, an armored vehicle rumbled out of an eastern neighborhood carrying wounded Ukrainian soldiers toward a stabilization point in the city’s west. Ukraine’s army was taking its hits, too.', 'It’s a grim stalemate that has taken on the rhythms of a heavyweight title bout, with each side going toe to toe in one of the longest-running battles of the war. That stands in contrast to Ukraine’s strategy elsewhere along the front line, where it succeeded by avoiding direct confrontations, relying instead on nimble maneuvers, deception and Western-provided long-range weapons to force Russian retreats.', 'In an earlier phase of the war, Ukraine’s leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battles like Bakhmut. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a rare moment of public self-doubt, mulled then whether the deaths of about 100 Ukrainian soldiers per day in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk were worth the fight for two already ruined cities.', 'But this time, there has been no second-guessing. And new research suggests the lethal urban combat last summer was not as senseless as it might have seemed at the time.', 'An analysis by two leading military analysts published last month by the Foreign Policy Research Institute vindicated the attritional fighting. The pitched battle weakened the Russian Army enough for two Ukrainian counterattacks in the fall to succeed, wrote the analysts, Rob Lee and Michael Kofman. Those offensives, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south, delivered two of the most embarrassing defeats of the war to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.', '“The amount of ammunition Russia expended and the casualties they took set up the Russian Army for failure,” Mr. Lee said in an interview.', 'Whether Bakhmut winds up playing a similar role ahead of expected spring offensives by Ukraine depends on many variables, he said, including how many soldiers Russia can field after a mobilization this past fall.', 'Fierce fighting continued to rage on Monday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself.', 'Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a post on Telegram that after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Soledar and subsequent retreat, the enemy regrouped “and launched a powerful assault.” Ukrainian forces were “bravely defending every inch,” she wrote.', 'At the Pentagon on Monday, a senior U.S. military official described the combat in and around Bakhmut as “really severe and savage” with both sides slugging it out. ', 'Bakhmut’s strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months. In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. Mr. Zelensky cited the city in a high-profile appearance before the U.S. Congress last month, and presented House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut. ', '(The imperative to “Hold Bakhmut,” as Ukrainians say, nevertheless carries some risks, analysts warn, saying that it could cloud military judgment and potentially delay a retreat if one becomes necessary). ', 'Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city’s eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.', '“It’s a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,” Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former American commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month.', 'A drone overflight of the wasteland on Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. “It looks like apocalypse,” Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.', 'Inside the city, few civilians remain, most on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.', 'Soldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in a sport utility vehicle, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days.', 'Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside.', 'In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia’s invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region.', 'Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city’s prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove on Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.', 'In the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained.', '“Everybody suffers” in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen.', 'The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks.', 'The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company’s owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics.', 'Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers; Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults.', ' “Essentially they take the brunt of whatever Ukrainian response there is,” said the senior American military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. “Then you have better trained forces that move behind them to claim the ground that these individuals have walked over.” ', 'Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, called the fighting around Bakhmut “a completely different nature” of war. Ukraine persists in the city’s defense, he said, in part because “their losses are important for us.”', 'The attack on Friday was a case in point.', 'The Russians were moving forward from the forest into the town on foot, with no armored vehicles to be seen by the drone flying overhead. On the screen, the readings of altitude and range ticked up and down.', '“Without eyes, we lose people,” said the drone pilot, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Navara, in keeping with Ukrainian military policy. “And we cannot lose people. We have fewer anyway.”', 'Navara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that “the bastards are about 800 meters that way,” pointing a finger out the broken window of the building.', 'Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes. In the streets of the neighborhood, a firefight was picking up, and the clatter of machine guns echoed about.', 'After a few flights, the drone team drove out by another road, avoiding the street fighting.', 'Private Andriy Pancheko, a member of the drone team, had been working as an electrician in Poland before the invasion but returned and volunteered in the army. Broadly, he said, Ukrainians were defending their country because “if we don’t fight, we won’t have freedom.”', 'The purpose of holding out specifically in the ruins of eastern Bakhmut was less clear, he admitted. “I don’t know, I just take orders,” he said. “They commanded me to be here. But why not? It’s our land.”']"

Putin of Russia promised a unilateral pause in some areas, there was little indication of such on the ground, where fighting continued as normal.', 'This offer was also probably intended as an act of propaganda, aimed at the Russian public and particularly at the Orthodox Church leaders whose support the Kremlin relies on. Moscow, which has presented itself as the protector of Ukraine’s Orthodox Christians, had said the cease-fire was intended to spare civilians during Orthodox Christmas, which fell this past weekend.', 'Mr. Putin hardly invented the practice of using cease-fires or peace negotiations as propaganda or as covers for short-term tactical advantage. For as long as nations have gone to war, leaders have timed diplomatic efforts to complement those on the battlefield, much as they have ordered military advances to bolster their positions at the negotiation table.', 'Nor does this mean that Moscow never intends to engage seriously in diplomatic talks. Most wars end in political settlement, as Russian leaders surely know, having done this themselves, including with Ukraine itself several years ago over a prior round of Russian assaults.', 'Still, Mr. Putin’s repeated, if rarely borne-out, lip service toward conciliation reflects a dimension particular to this war: his hopes to break the Western support for Ukraine, which has played a major role in stymying his ambitions there.', 'Ukraine’s leaders have treated the effort to deepen Western financial and military support as a front virtually as important as any on the battlefield.', 'That support has staved off Ukrainian economic collapse, kept Ukrainian forces supplied long after they would have otherwise run out of ammunition and even helped those forces, equipped with increasingly sophisticated Western weaponry, push back once-rapid Russian advances.', 'At the same time, Western economic sanctions on Russia are curbing its ability to wage the war and weakening Mr. Putin’s position at home.', 'Western support has, in other words, helped to turn what Mr. Putin expected to be a rapid Russian victory into a costly and uncertain slog.', 'So he is looking for any opportunity to break that support. This includes gestures toward diplomacy that are seemingly aimed, at least in part, at opening divisions among Western capitals, and within the domestic politics of those countries, over the war.', '“Calls for a cease-fire, audible across Europe and America, are badly misplaced,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wrote in a New York Times guest essay in July. “This is not the time to accept unfavorable cease-fire proposals or peace deals.”', 'Moscow has sought to portray Ukrainian leaders as obstacles to peace, hoping that some European leaders or opposition parties would eventually agree.', 'Ukrainian leaders fear, and Russian leaders hope, that this might lead some Western governments to diminish their support for Ukraine’s war efforts. Or lead them to pressure Kyiv to accept a cease-fire that Moscow could use to redouble its assault. Or even to push for peace talks that, coming as Russian forces still hold large stretches of Ukraine, would probably favor Moscow’s terms more so than if Ukrainian forces continued to push back the invaders.', 'This was not an unreasonable expectation, particularly in the war’s early days. In the years before the invasion last February, Western capitals had often differed over matters related to Russia.', 'And any unified Western military policy is generally organized through NATO, and any economic policy partly through the European Union, two heavily bureaucratic organizations that seek to operate through consensus among their 30 or so member states.', 'But so far, Western states have been seen as generally unified in backing Ukraine in the war and have even taken this support further than many analysts expected.', 'France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had in the weeks before Russia’s invasion presented himself as the intermediary between Moscow and other Western capitals. But now he has emerged as one of Ukraine’s most assertive military backers.', 'Last week Mr. Macron announced that France would deliver armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine’s military. It was yet another escalation in Western military support to Ukraine and another instance of Western leaders’ ignoring Russian warnings against such direct involvement.', 'As if to underscore how little success Mr. Putin has found in opening cleavages within the West, on the same day that he announced this past weekend’s cease-fire, Washington and Berlin announced that they, too, would supply Ukraine with armored fighting vehicles.', '“The president’s diplomatic team has managed to convince the allies: The time of weapons taboo has passed,” Mr. Kuleba wrote in a Facebook post, referring to Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky.', 'Germany’s participation is telling. Since World War II, its leaders have emphasized diplomacy toward Moscow, positioning themselves as counterweights to a more hawkish Washington. As Europe’s largest economy and a major force within the European Union, it has often set the tempo on such matters. And German voters are considered particularly averse to the economic burdens associated with isolating Russia, which supplies much of Europe’s energy.', 'Mr. Putin has long sought to put pressure on those sensitivities, seemingly hoping that German leaders would modulate Western support for Ukraine, perhaps even splintering that coalition over, say, Russian proposals for peace talks.', 'It is a mark of how little success Mr. Putin has found that German leaders have instead escalated their military involvement in ways that would have once been unthinkable, and not for the first time since Russia’s invasion.', '“If Putin wanted peace,” Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, wrote last week on Twitter in response to Russia’s cease-fire proposal, “he would take his soldiers home and the war would be over.”']"

Soldiers in white camouflage crouched low, shooting at the hill opposite to provide cover as four men evacuated a casualty.', 'The action was part of a live-fire training exercise for new recruits on a recent morning outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But there was an unusual element to the event. While a Ukrainian Army officer was giving the orders, the trainees were members of a volunteer Chechen battalion that also mixed in some Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.', 'Ukraine’s military commanders have long said they do not lack soldiers for the war, but they have nonetheless welcomed to their ranks thousands of volunteers, including foreign citizens. Many of them, like the Chechens, are refugees from Russia itself. Others have come from surrounding nations, like Georgia, that have a history of opposition to Moscow and the leadership of President Vladimir V. Putin.', '“We saw what was happening,” said Muslim Madiyev, a gray-bearded deputy commander of the Chechen battalion, wearing ear protectors to muffle the sound of gunfire as he watched the training exercises. “Ukraine has no shortage of men, but we have to join and be a part of this war.”', 'Many of the volunteers were already living in Ukraine, either for work or seeking refuge from political oppression back home. Some volunteers have struggled with visas and residency permits, while their eagerness to join the fight has aroused suspicions among some Ukrainian officials and commanders, who are on high alert for saboteurs.', 'But the volunteers seem to be finding their place. Mr. Madiyev, a veteran of two wars in Chechnya against Moscow, was an associate of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the former Soviet general who led Chechnya’s bid for independence from Russia in the 1990s. Exiled from Chechnya, Mr. Madiyev settled in Ukraine in 2016.', 'His battalion, named for the late Chechen leader, is one of several Chechen units that have joined Ukraine in its fight against Russia in recent years, following the 2014 uprising of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Mr. Madiyev declined to reveal how many active fighters he had, saying simply, “We have enough.”', 'He spoke about the Russian invasion the way many Ukrainians do, saying that if Moscow is not stopped in Ukraine, it will threaten many more countries of Europe.', 'But the younger fighters in his battalion take things further.', '“Our aim is the liberation of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria,” a Chechen fighter said, using the name of the erstwhile self-declared republic, “and to help all the nations who want it, to gain freedom.” In accordance with military protocol, he gave only his code name, Maga.', 'The Chechens are only one example of numerous ethnic-based battalions and regiments that have been forming in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last February.', ' Fighters from Belarus have formed a regiment thousands strong. Other volunteers come from the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as from ethnic minorities that have large populations in Russia: Chechens, Tatars and Turkic-speaking groups.', 'Most of them are motivated by historical grievances of dispossession and suppression by Moscow. Chechens and Tatars were among many groups that were decimated by forcible deportations under Stalin in the 1940s.', 'There is also a smattering of Russian exiles, among them Russian nationalists and neo-Nazis who are opposed to Mr. Putin. A thousands-strong regiment of Belarusians includes many opponents of the country’s president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko.', 'Their participation in the war may be useful for Ukraine, but it is also a potentially explosive issue for the Kyiv government because most of them harbor long-term political ambitions to return home and overthrow the Russian and Belarusian governments. Ukrainian military officials declined to comment on their use of the volunteer groups, while a spokesman for the Ukrainian security service, the S.B.U., said it was not responsible for managing them.', 'But the volunteers themselves say that they are acting with the full knowledge and under the orders of the Ukrainian Army and intelligence services. Many of their operations are covert, including dangerous reconnaissance or sabotage missions behind Russian lines.', 'In response to an appeal by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, early in the war, thousands of volunteers poured in from Western countries, including the United States and Britain. Most joined the International Legion, which has been recognized by the Ukrainian government and, to some extent, integrated into the Ukrainian Army.', 'At a news briefing last month, Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said there were ideological and political benefits to having foreign soldiers fighting alongside Ukrainians in defense of European values.', 'Foreign soldiers were also gaining valuable experience, he added: “The experience of the modern war here, the war of technologies, drone war and electronic warfare. So I think it’s a win-win exchange.”', 'But the volunteers from former Soviet republics are, in many ways, even more useful.', 'They have a linguistic advantage because most speak Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, and sometimes Ukrainian, making coordination with the Ukrainian military easier. And some, like a group of Georgians in the Kavkaz Legion, have battlefield experience, having served with the NATO-led force in Afghanistan.', 'Their knowledge of Russia and Russians, and their hatred of Moscow, has made the volunteers good undercover operators for Kyiv. Some Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have even expressed support for their causes. In October, for example, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion recognizing the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as a territory occupied by Russia.', 'But they also face substantial risks, given the nature of their work behind enemy lines. Not just Russian citizens, but virtually any undercover soldiers captured by Russian forces would be dealt with harshly.', 'One of the more recently formed volunteer battalions, Turan, is composed of Turkic-speaking ethnic groups from the Caucasus, Central Asia and Russia. It is led by a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, Almaz Kudabek, who had worked as a barber on American bases in his home country and in the Afghan city of Kandahar.', 'He says he has recruited Azerbaijanis, Tatars and Chinese Uyghurs to the group, and he talks passionately about the marginalization and oppression of Turkic-speaking minorities in Russia. He said that Moscow had unfairly drawn conscripts for the war predominantly from remote and poorer regions of Russia, including those populated by Turkic-speaking ethnic minorities, who have been killed in far greater numbers than ethnic Russians.', 'But Mr. Kudabek said members of his unit could turn that injustice to their advantage, infiltrating Russian-occupied territory on sabotage missions and even passing themselves off as Russian soldiers.', '“We just want to fight Russians,” he said. “We know what they are.”', 'Despite their evident value to the Ukrainian military, the commanders of ethnic battalions complained of a lack of support from Kyiv. The Chechen battalion leader, Mr. Madiyev, said that beyond weapons and ammunition, the units have to provide for their own food, fuel and equipment.', 'The leader of a Russian regiment, a far-right nationalist who uses the code name White Rex, said he ran into multiple obstacles when he formed the unit shortly after the Russians invaded.

But he said the war had taught him that the way to return to Russia was to overthrow Mr. Putin and his government.', '“The Russian Volunteer Corps marches in and destroys the current government — that’s the only way,” he said. “You cannot persuade a tyrant to leave, and any other force would be seen as invaders.”']"

Next to them was a German DM51 fragmentation grenade.', 'They were all important ingredients for Ukrainian troops trying to piece together a puzzle: How do you create a grenade that weighs next to nothing but can be dropped from a drone and destroy a roughly 40-ton Russian tank?', '“War is an economy. It’s money,” said Graf, a stout, bearded Ukrainian soldier in charge of his unit’s drone team. “And if you have a drone for $3,000 and a grenade for $200, and you destroy a tank that costs $3 million, it’s very interesting.”', 'Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, technological advancements on the battlefield have mostly centered on both countries’ increased use of small, remotely operated drones and their growing importance in almost every aspect of the war — including reconnaissance, correcting artillery fire and so-called kamikaze attacks.', 'Now Graf and his team, who have become experts at killing Russian troops with munitions dropped from the air, are trying to raise the drones’ effectiveness to the next level: by using them to deliver what they consider the perfect grenade.', 'The challenge is building that grenade.', '“It’s our main goal,” Graf said last month from his headquarters in the city of Sloviansk. He was surrounded by the various components needed to turn a flying toy into a lethal battlefield tool. Like other Ukrainian soldiers during the war, he identified himself to reporters only by his military call sign.', 'The tinkering in Graf’s workroom is another example of how Ukraine’s military has adapted as the war progresses, creating advantages in the face of the Russian Army’s superiority in troop numbers and long-range weaponry.', 'The grenade, Graf said, should weigh around 1.1 pounds, the maximum weight a DJI Mavic 3 drone can carry without its flight being significantly disrupted.', 'To get the grenade closer to the desired weight, his team has been using a 3-D printer to try to make a lightweight casing that can hold the explosives needed to penetrate a tank’s armor. The painstaking task involves experimenting with grenades of differing designs, clasped in a vise in their workroom, and operating around the explosive mechanisms to fine-tune them.', 'The grenade should be able to penetrate the hull of an armored personnel carrier or tank, something not currently possible with a munition weighing around a pound, Graf said. For now, their best grenade is the German-supplied DM51, an explosive that, with stabilizing fins attached, weighs near their imposed threshold.', 'But the DM51 is manufactured to kill people, and is not effective against a tank.', '“Every day, we study, we make some experiments with grenades, with bombs, with drones, and make our work better,” Graf added.', 'To Graf and the legions of Ukrainian drone operators and armorers, the quest for an enhanced grenade is part of a broader drone arms race with Russia. Like Graf’s team, the Russian military is also trying to make its small unmanned vehicles deadlier, to varying levels of success.', 'The Chinese-made Mavic 3 drone has turned into the ubiquitous backbone of Ukraine’s drone forces. It is small, portable, has a decent battery life and range and can quickly be outfitted to drop grenades. Russian forces use it, too.', 'The Russians’ bigger military drones, like the self-exploding Shahed-136, which is made in Iran and frequently launched at Ukraine’s infrastructure, are used differently from the small Mavics that are deployed against concentrations of troops and trenches. The Mavics are quadcopters — they can hover like a helicopter directly over their target before dropping their lethal cargo.', 'Ukraine has stayed ahead in the drones arm race in much the same way as it has succeeded on the battlefield: Lower-level commanders have more leeway in how and when to use them, and drone units like Graf’s have less bureaucracy to navigate to test and deploy their weapons.', '“The Ukrainian drone effort is more streamlined and works directly with the military,” said Samuel Bendett, a specialist on Russian drones and other weapons at CNA, a research and analysis organization in Arlington, Va. “The Russians are only getting there now.”', 'That means that Graf and his comrades’ inventions can quickly be shared with other drone units in chat groups before being used in the field, with little oversight.', 'Russia, Mr. Bendett said, has taken a more industrial approach to the drone arms race, preferring munitions that are mass produced, though some Russian volunteer groups are making progress in testing and sending drones to the front line. The only drawback for the Russians: navigating Moscow’s Soviet-era bureaucracy to get the right equipment into their soldiers’ hands, Mr. Bendett said.', '“There’s a lot of this back-and-forth,” he said. “One side has a tech breakthrough, and the other side catches up.”', 'Tucked away on one of the shelves in Graf’s workshop was evidence of Moscow’s industrialized attempts to compete with Kyiv: a factory-produced Russian OFSP, a small, roughly 40-millimeter grenade meant to be dropped by an Orlan-10, a reconnaissance drone that sounds like a lawn mower. The grenade had a manufacture date of March 2022 stenciled onto its side.', '“They are just dropping a default modification of this grenade,” said Iliya, one of Graf’s drone engineers and armorers. “We are dropping everything that we can find.” The main thing to consider, he said, “is the weight of a grenade that the drone can move.”', 'Another obstacle that Ukrainian drone operators face is having to modify the weapons to work in ways that they were not originally built to.', 'The challenges are twofold: Inundated with munitions from countries like France, Germany and the United States, Ukrainian troops need to learn the intricacies of each device before jerry-rigging the explosives.', 'That process is complicated, too. Some small grenades like the M433, which is made and supplied by the United States — and is sometimes called the Golden Egg because of its size, shape and color — have the kind of shaped-charge warhead that can punch through armor plate. But they are meant to be fired only from hand-held grenade launchers, and not dropped by drones.', 'So Ukrainian soldiers must carefully place the grenade into a vise grip, pry off the cartridge case that contains the propellant used to fire it and then begin the even more delicate work of teasing off the aluminum cup over the grenade’s nose. With pliers and other hand tools, the soldiers must gently probe and manipulate the fuze’s inner mechanisms to disable both of its safety features. If successful, they are left with a grenade that could easily explode if mishandled.', 'And before it can be sent on a mission against Russian troops, the explosive has to be carefully mounted onto the drone.', 'Graf said that no one on his team had been killed while working on the grenades, but that the process was perilous for troops on the front line. There are “many, many dead guys because they don’t understand how these things work,” he said.', 'Despite the risks, Graf and his team continue to tinker in their workshop teeming with different kinds of explosives, edging ever closer to the elusive tank-killing grenade. Currently, they have a munition that they say can penetrate Russian armor, but it is around a half-pound too heavy.', '“We make grenades from the trash,” joked Graf. “But if you can destroy a tank from a Mavic, you’re the best at this war.”']"

The three different vehicles use different ammunition types, meaning more of a logistics headache for the Ukrainian troops using them. The French one runs on large tires; the others on treads.', 'But the Bradley and Marder can both carry troops, making them critical for any kind of future Ukrainian offensive operations against Russia’s defenses along a front line that stretches more than 600 miles and has, in recent weeks, mostly stabilized after being reinforced by newly mobilized troops.', 'Ukraine has been pressing its Western allies regularly for more sophisticated infantry equipment, including armored infantry fighting vehicles and top-of-the-line Western tanks, like the American Abrams and the German Leopard II.', 'But Washington, Paris and Berlin have been cautious, trying to provide the weapons Ukraine actually needs and is capable of maintaining, while also keeping a wary eye on the depth of their own sometimes meager stockpiles. ', 'American officials have argued that Ukraine has enough good tanks in its Soviet-era T-72s, though it is running short of ammunition for them. The Americans and Germans argue that to train Ukrainians to operate modern Leopard or Abrams tanks — and to maintain them in the field — would take many months. The logistics chain needed for a fuel-guzzling tank like the Abrams is also extensive, added a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss tactical matters.', 'Currently, Ukrainian forces are using their Soviet-era tanks in more of a support role, keeping them protected behind the lines and employing their large main guns like artillery. They often rely on armored personnel carriers to move troops quickly in offensive maneuvers.', 'On Friday, the Biden administration announced a new $3 billion package of military assistance for Ukraine that includes Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which officials said would be especially helpful to Ukrainian units fighting Russian forces in the Donbas region of the country’s east. The administration said it would send 50 Bradleys. Germany has said it will provide 40 Marders.', 'The German coalition government led by a Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been especially careful to draw a line between defensive weapons, like the Gepard mobile antiaircraft vehicles, which have tank treads, and weapons that can be used for offensive infantry fighting, like the Marder and the Leopard. Berlin has maintained that it would not be the first NATO ally to supply such weapons to Ukraine.', 'President Emmanuel Macron of France has held a similar stance, if more quietly. But on Wednesday, after discussions with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Macron suddenly announced that France would supply its AMX-10 to Ukraine — an infantry fighting vehicle with wheels, not tank treads, in service since the 1980s and being phased out in the French military.', 'A NATO diplomat said on Friday that France, Germany and the United States had been discussing providing Ukraine with such vehicles, including the American Bradley and the German Marder, but that Mr. Macron went ahead on his own and announced France’s decision.', 'On Thursday, after a conversation between President Biden and Mr. Scholz, the Germans said, the Americans and Germans consulted and announced their own decision to supply Bradleys and Marders, satisfying the German condition that Berlin not be the first to supply a new category of Western weaponry to Ukraine.', 'Germany also announced that it would supply a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine in addition to the one that it was supplying to Poland — and which it had initially refused to give directly to Ukraine. That taboo, too, has now been broken.', '“It’s another step forward for Germany, which has been going one step at a time since Feb. 24,” said Ulrike Franke, a German defense expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations.', 'Ukraine has been asking for these weapons since April, she said, but for Germany “it was a self-imposed taboo.” In Berlin, “we keep having these slightly absurd debates — offensive versus defensive, light versus heavy, modern versus old — and then a few months later we change our lines again,” she said. It’s an important evolution, “mostly in the German imagination,” she said.', 'But it is also a bad look for the Franco-German relationship, she said, looking either like Berlin needs a push from Paris or that the two countries can’t work well together, with Mr. Macron pre-empting matters on his own.']"

It also carries TOW missiles than can destroy enemy tanks, and the vehicle’s hull is wrapped with advanced armor blocks to protect it from incoming fire. Some versions of the vehicle are equipped with laser range-finders and thermal optics to help the crew of three soldiers find targets they can engage — which would offer Ukrainian troops an advantage on the battlefield.

The Pentagon will also send 36 more 105-millimeter towed howitzers along with ammunition.', 'The U.S. will send 4,000 Zuni rockets — eight-foot long unguided rockets fired by warplanes that can carry about 10 pounds of explosives, and American RIM-7 Sea Sparrow air-defense missiles that Ms. Cooper said had been adapted to work with Ukraine’s Soviet-era Buk missile launchers.', '“It is a creative solution that did require some engineering finesse,” she said of adapting the American missiles for Russian-made launchers. “But we’re very pleased that it will work for the Ukrainians.”', 'The Pentagon will send 100 more M113 armored personnel carriers, in addition to the 200 already committed to Kyiv, and 138 more Humvee trucks added to the 1,300 the U.S. has already sent.', '“As you look at the U.S. and the international response by providing the equipment, and importantly now the training that we’re providing, it does afford Ukraine an opportunity to change the equation on the battlefield and gain momentum and not only defend their territory but hopefully take back territory,” Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said to reporters at the briefing with Ms. Cooper. “And so this is part of that ongoing effort to support them in that larger campaign.”', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed his gratitude for the package in his nightly address on Friday.', '“For the first time, we will get Bradley Fighting Vehicles — this is exactly what is needed,” he said. “New guns and projectiles, including high-precision ones.

But companies have packed up and moved, switched products and found support abroad.","['Piles of corn and wheat are stuck in silos, as Russia’s invasion stifles critical exports. Metal-producing factories in Ukraine’s bombed-out east have ceased operating. And through nearly a year of war, over a third of Ukraine’s spending is being directed at beating back the enemy.', 'Despite major battlefield defeats in its invasion, the Kremlin’s relentless war effort has sown economic havoc atop a devastating humanitarian toll in Ukraine. The country’s economy shrank by 30.4 percent in 2022, its economy minister said Thursday, the largest decline since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.', '“It’s easier to say what we lost” than what survives in Ukraine’s economy, said Hlib Vyshlinsky, the executive director of the Centre for Economic Strategy, a think tank in Kyiv.', 'Swaths of the country’s industry and infrastructure have been partially or fully destroyed, and may not be rebuilt. Many businesses based in territory controlled by Russia, or in areas of heavy fighting, are not producing near their capacity, if at all. Consumers across the country are buying less because of high inflation and economic uncertainty generated by the war.', 'But the war has also spurred Ukrainians to restructure parts of their economy at lightning speed, in ways big and small, as companies pack up operations or pivot to new business. That has fostered an extraordinary amount of economic adaptability that is not reflected in the dire numbers, and is setting the groundwork for potential rebuilding even before the war ends, the government argued.', '', 'Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister, said in a statement Thursday that the “indomitable spirit” of the Ukrainian people, along with financial support from international donors, had allowed the government in Kyiv to “maintain the economic front and continue our movement toward victory.” And while the damage has been profound, the hit to the economy was slightly lower than the worst forecasts.', '', 'The biggest damage has come in Ukraine’s major export sectors, which before the war made up the bulk of the country’s income. The conflict caused a 35 percent drop last year in exports of everything from wheat to steel.', 'Agriculture, once a pillar of Ukraine’s economy — making it known as a breadbasket of the world — has been dealt an especially harsh setback as Moscow continues to block most shipments, despite a U.N.-brokered deal.', 'Compounding the problem, Russia’s attacks on the country’s energy grid have disrupted the flow of food, contributing to a global food crisis. Storage has run out for many harvests, leaving Ukrainian farmers scrambling for makeshift solutions. On average, Ukraine can now export only about 5 to 6 million tons of grain a month, down from about 8 million tons before the war.', 'Ukraine had also been a major exporter of metals and raw materials, such as iron ore. But nearly all of Ukraine’s large factories producing steel and other key metals were located in eastern territories that were captured or severely bombed by Russia. A vast majority of those facilities have more or less stopped operating, said Tymofiy Milovanov, the president of the Kyiv School of Economics.', 'Russian missiles have struck cities and facilities across the country, dealing heavy damage to a huge amount of the nation’s housing, transportation and energy infrastructure. The Kyiv School of Economics has estimated that the direct costs of war-related damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure were $127 billion as of September.', 'Rebuilding the country will run to some $750 billion, Ukrainian officials have said, while the World Bank has put the reconstruction estimate at closer to $349 billion.', 'In order to revive its economy and manage a sustained recovery once the fighting ends — and it has no end in sight — Ukraine is expected to amass large debts.', 'The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had both estimated that Ukraine’s economy would shrink by 35 percent in 2022. The I.M.F. had predicted modest economic growth for this year, but that is subject to huge uncertainty about the course of the war: The I.M.F. set the range of outcomes at a potential decline of more than 10 percent, in the pessimistic scenario, to growth of 10 percent in the more optimistic case.', 'Ukrainian officials are clinging to the sunnier outlook, in large part because a type of shadow economy has developed amid the war, said Mr. Milovanov. That has kept economic activity, powered by donated generators or volunteer efforts, for instance, humming beneath the radar of the dry statistical figures, he said.', '“In some ways, the entire notion of a G.D.P. calculation during wartime is silly, because it assumes year-to-year preferences and production are constant, while shifts like a drop in services or people joining the military is seen as a negative,” Mr. Milovanov said in a phone interview from Kyiv. In fact, he said, economic activity in Ukraine has become “much more agile” to adapt to wartime.', 'Ukrainian farmers, for example, have continued to plant and harvest crops despite the threat from Russian rockets and land mines, and have adapted planting to cultivate more in-demand crops, like corn.', 'The industrial sector has adapted, too. Factories producing everything from mattresses to trucks have relocated from cratered regions of the east to the relative safety of Ukraine’s western frontier.', 'Hundreds of plants that had been in Russian-occupied areas were packed up in the summer and moved on trains and trucks to Ukraine’s west. Outside the city of Lviv, close to Poland — Ukraine’s gateway to Germany and western Europe — many of the reborn businesses are forging ties with the European Union, which Ukraine hopes to join soon.', 'Ukrainian tech start-ups are writing software for foreign companies and now have direct lines to major companies in Europe and the United States, where many want to help Ukraine through the war.', 'Thousands of Ukrainians displaced by war have also set up as entrepreneurs elsewhere in the country to try to forge new lives and add to the local economy. Even restaurants have adapted: Many have stayed open for business despite power outages through innovations like “candlelight menus,” or meals that don’t require cooking.', '“Ukrainians are resilient,” said Mr. Vyshlinsky, the think tank director. During blackouts in the capital, he said, the soundtrack of a walk through the city is an “orchestra of power generators.”', 'And with vast amounts of Ukraine’s national budget having been redirected toward military spending, hundreds of new small businesses have sprung up to cater to the wartime economy’s needs.', '“The nature of demand is now coming from the Defense Ministry, so if you can produce bulletproof vests, military training, services for medical training or even cybersecurity equipment, many new companies have been created, and they are profitable,” Mr. Milovanov added.', 'Yet Russia’s destruction of critical infrastructure has dealt Ukraine a setback heading into the second year of the war. The path of Ukraine’s economy this year will depend heavily on the ability to keep electricity flowing, limiting the length of blackouts and the need to ration power, according to Mr. Vyshlinsky.', 'He forecasts economic growth to be flat this year — a less optimistic outlook than many forecasters, but also not as pessimistic as those who think that another big drop is in store.', 'In the meantime, international donors are circling Ukraine, which has laid out a blueprint for an eventual Marshall Plan to help rebuild once the war has ended. Ukrainian leaders have also made plans for the short term, recognizing that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia appears determined to continue with the invasion.', 'Ukraine has found ready supporters in the West, where leaders have largely remained unified despite the soaring energy prices caused by the war. So far, countries and institutions in the European Union have committed nearly 52 billion euros, about $55 billion, in military, financial, and humanitarian aid, while the United States has pledged some $51 billion, according to data compiled by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization.', 'Many governments and international companies, eyeing the prospect of a vast bounty of postwar contracts, are rushing to help Ukraine now, in the hopes of renewed deals when rebuilding starts in earnest.']"

But Ukraine’s leaders dismissed the idea as cynical posturing by a ruthless and untrustworthy enemy.', 'President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the cease-fire, from noon Friday until midnight Saturday, the Kremlin and the Defense Ministry said in separate statements. “Given that a large number of citizens practicing Orthodoxy resides in the areas of hostilities, we call on the Ukrainian side to announce a cease-fire and give them an opportunity to attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of Christ’s birth,” the Kremlin said.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine responded with derision in his nightly video message, though he did not explicitly rule out the idea. After switching from speaking Ukrainian to Russian to address the Russian people directly, he spoke of those who “sent all of your people to be slaughtered” and “do not strive for peace.”', '“Now they want to use Christmas as a cover” to pause Ukrainian advances “and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized troops closer to our positions,” he said. “Everyone in the world knows how the Kremlin uses lulls in the war to continue the war with new force,” he added.', 'Russia has previously rejected — and, according to Ukraine, has repeatedly violated — limited, local cease-fires intended to allow humanitarian evacuations and aid deliveries in besieged places like Mariupol.', 'The Kremlin’s announcement comes as Russian forces, after severe setbacks, are scrambling to build defenses, ferry new conscripts to the front and reconstitute shattered units. As the heavy cost of what was first billed as a quick and easy war comes home to ordinary Russians, Mr. Putin has become increasingly attentive to domestic public concerns about the conflict. At the same time, his government, isolated internationally, has tried to reshape opinions abroad.', 'In Washington, President Biden said it appeared that Mr. Putin was “trying to find some oxygen” with the cease-fire announcement. “I am reluctant to respond to anything Putin says,” Mr. Biden said. “I found it interesting he was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and New Year’s.”', 'The United States and Germany, meanwhile, announced on Thursday that they would supply Ukraine with armored fighting vehicles for the first time, a day after France did so, though they did not cite numbers. Ukrainian officials have pleaded for months for armored vehicles like those now promised, the American Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the French AMX-10 RC and the German Marder, as well as Western tanks, which Ukraine’s allies have so far refused to give.', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, after a phone call with Mr. Biden, said Germany would also send to Ukraine a Patriot missile system, the most sophisticated American-made air-defense weapon, two weeks after the president promised to give Ukraine its first Patriot system.', 'After starting to lose ground in late summer, Russian forces shifted to bombarding civilian targets in Ukraine, destroying electricity and heating systems and making air defenses critical for Ukrainians to survive the winter. There has been little movement recently on the battlefield, but that is expected to change in the coming months, putting a premium on armored vehicles.', 'Political and military analysts characterized Mr. Putin’s announced cease-fire as a public relations ploy that he would try to exploit no matter how Ukraine responds. If Kyiv agrees to a cease-fire, they said, it would allow Mr. Putin to present himself as a peacemaker.', 'If Ukraine ignores it, Russia could try to claim higher moral ground — despite the facts that Russia started the war and its forces have committed many documented atrocities — and use continued hostilities to vilify Ukraine in the eyes of Russian and world opinion.', 'Pavel Luzhin, a Russian military analyst, said the Kremlin “needs a break to partially restore its military power” but, knowing that Kyiv is unlikely to accept a cease-fire, is playing to a domestic audience. “The Kremlin is going to demonstrate to Russians, who are mostly tired from the war, why the Russian leadership needs to continue fighting,” he said.', 'In recent days, Ukraine has claimed to have used long-range artillery to inflict huge casualties in attacks on several concentrations of Russian troops behind the front lines, and the Russians have confirmed heavy losses in one location. Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst, said Mr. Putin could be trying to avoid another such disaster during the holiday.', 'Within hours, some of Mr. Putin’s most hawkish allies appeared to be undercutting his plan. Some pro-war Russian nationalists dismissed the cease-fire idea out of hand, underlining the depth of mutual animosity.', '“We — Russian soldiers and volunteers — don’t want any compromises,” an influential military blogger, Vladlen Tatarsky, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “We want to kill every person dressed in the uniform of the enemy’s army.”', 'The most prominent Kremlin proxy in occupied Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, wrote on Telegram that “there can be no talk of any truce,” and that a cease-fire “doesn’t mean that we will not respond to the opponent’s provocations.” Mr. Pushilin, who was the head of the self-proclaimed breakaway state in the Donetsk region that Russia has claimed to annex, added that the cease-fire applied only to Orthodox Christians, not to the leadership of Ukraine — possibly a reference to Mr. Zelensky’s being Jewish.', 'Some Ukrainians observe Christmas on Dec. 25, especially in the western part of the country, where there is a significant Roman Catholic population. But Orthodox churches, which still use the Julian calendar rather than the newer Gregorian calendar, mark it on Jan. 7, which falls this year on Saturday.', 'Russia’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, a close ally of Mr. Putin’s, called for a cease-fire to allow Orthodox Christians on both sides of the front line to attend church services. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who has positioned himself as a mediator in the conflict, spoke to Mr. Putin on Thursday and also called for a cease-fire.', 'Ned Price, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told reporters that the Kremlin’s announcement was “cynical.” He added, “I think we know better than to take anything we see or hear from Russia at face value.”', 'Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Mr. Zelensky, spurned the Kremlin’s cease-fire proposal in a statement as a “propaganda gesture” and a “banal trick.”', '“After 10 months of genocide, after hundreds of destroyed Ukrainian churches, isn’t it too late for the Kremlin to think of God?” Ukraine’s defense ministry asked on social media. The foreign ministry also said Mr. Putin’s proposal “cannot and should not be taken seriously.”', 'Ukrainian officials have already accused Russia of marring the run-up to Orthodox Christmas with continued attacks on civilians.

A pattern to the crimes is emerging, she added. “Now we see there is a line of war crimes in the Russian Army and among Russian commanders.”', 'Russian officials have repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses, despite widespread evidence and accounts collected by Ukrainian and international investigators. A spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, recently dismissed a report by the U.N. Human Rights Commission as unsubstantiated testimonies and no more than “rumors and gossip.”', 'After investigating some areas Russia retreated from, an independent international commission reported to the United Nations in October that “an array of war crimes committed in Ukraine” included cases of sexual violence against women and girls.', 'Victims ranged from older than 80 to as young as a 4-year-old girl forced to perform oral sex on a soldier, which is rape, the report said. It detailed more than a dozen cases involving gang rapes, family members forced to watch a relative being sexually assaulted and sexual violence against detainees.', 'Iryna Didenko, who leads the prosecutor’s department investigating such crimes, has already opened 154 cases of conflict-related sexual violence. The real number, she said, is “much, much more.”', 'In one formerly occupied village in the Kyiv region, psychologists found one in nine women had experienced sexual violence, she said. Hundreds of people suffered sexual violence and torture in Russian detention, she added.', 'The trauma is raw and inhibiting. Viktoriya, a 42-year-old woman in the Kyiv region, shakes when she describes how, in early March, Russian soldiers shot dead her neighbor and then hauled her and her neighbor’s wife off to be raped.', '“The fear still remains,” she said. “Sometimes when the electricity is out, I am seized by fear and I feel they could come back.”', 'Viktoriya was one of the few survivors willing to talk publicly. She asked that only her first name be used and that her face not be photographed, as did several other women, for fear of reprisals by Russian forces.', 'But the stigma and judgment of neighbors and acquaintances were also an abiding pain, she said.', '“They are gossiping about me, and I mostly stay at home,” she said. ', 'The grief was such that her neighbor Nataliia, who was also raped and whose husband was killed, was given refuge abroad. Her 15-year-old son was suicidal in the weeks after the attack, said Ms. Didenko.', 'A psychologist and lawyer, Ms. Didenko met Nataliia when she visited their village after Russian troops withdrew. Before the war, her department had handled domestic violence crimes, and she knew well the difficulties women faced in reporting crimes, she said.', 'Much of that has to do with the stigma of rape in a conservative religious society, but there is also a deep-seated distrust of the authorities in a post-Soviet system that has rarely focused on victims’ needs and often blamed them instead.', '“From our experience with domestic violence, we realized victims do not talk about it in principle,” Ms. Didenko said. It is even harder in a war when they could be accused of fraternizing with the enemy, she said.', '“No one will come running to apply to us,” she said. “That’s why we decided that we have to go to them.”', 'The need to help Ukraine’s survivors of sexual violence is immense, activists say. The nation’s few women’s shelters have started taking in war victims. Aid organizations such as Women for Women International and  the Andreev Foundation started providing mobile gynecological clinics and counseling sessions.', 'Of more than 800 woman and girls that the foundation has counseled since the invasion began, 22 have acknowledged experiencing sexual violence in the war. Eight were younger than 18.', 'Some survivors have expressed suicidal thoughts, said Anna Orel, an assistant project manager at the foundation. “One girl said that she wanted to cut off her own skin,” she said. “She could not bear the smell of men’s perfume.”', 'Others were scared of military uniforms, even of Ukrainian soldiers, and of men in general.', '“Many of them don’t want to continue to live,” Ms. Orel said. “It’s very, very important for some professional person to hold their hand and to go through this with them.”', 'From the accounts of those who have come forward, there is evidence that Russian commanders knew about rape or even encouraged it, officials said. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer advising Ukrainian prosecutors, said he had seen signs of acquiescence by commanders among 30 cases he had reviewed.', 'Ms. Didenko said there was a clear pattern of behavior when Russian troops seized an area: “Ground forces arrive, and rapes start on the second or third day.”', 'Witnesses reported commanders’ ordering rape or giving instructions that suggested they condoned it, like telling soldiers to find some relaxation. ', 'In one case Ms. Didenko described, a commander told his men, “OK, go,” as he waited outside a house. One soldier was heard saying, “We’ll just beat her,” about one woman, and “This one we’ll rape.”', 'In another case, eight Russian soldiers raped and assaulted a man who was stopped at a checkpoint.', '“These are not single cases,” Ms. Didenko said.', 'There is an even clearer pattern, she said, of organized sexual abuse in the detention facilities run by Russian troops, police officers and security forces.', 'Investigators have found at least four large detention facilities in Kherson City, with graphic evidence of systemic torture under Russian occupiers.', 'In a business center’s basement, detainees slept on pieces of cardboard in complete darkness and carved tallies to count the days and messages into the wall. “Oh God, give strength,” one read.', '“This was the torture room,” said Yaroslav Manko, 30, a prosecutor from the region. The police found a rubber baton, metal handcuffs and an electric grill that Mr. Manko said was used to burn detainees’ fingers. They also found a list naming Russian officers who had worked there.', 'There was extensive sexual abuse in the detention centers, including rape with batons and electric shocks to genitals, prosecutors and city officials said.', 'Olha, the Kherson woman, said that over 14 days in detention this fall she was threatened with rape and  was punched and kicked in the head and chest, breaking a rib. Russians put clamps on her legs, arms and earlobes to send an electric current through her body, she said, and doused her in water to worsen the shocks.', 'Her interrogators knew she worked with volunteers bringing aid from Ukrainian-held territory to civilians in Kherson. They demanded she film a propaganda video and distribute supplies in the name of United Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin’s governing political party.', 'Another activist, Andriy, 35, was held for five days in August. Russian occupiers accused him of helping underground partisans and demanded he give up his friends and acquaintances.', '“They give you electric shocks, then you’re given a rest,” he said. “As you are recovering, they beat you with batons or fists.” The bruises on his back were shaped in a Z, a symbol of Russian fighters in Ukraine, he said. The electrical shocks to his earlobes knocked him unconscious. The shocks to his genitals still cause pain four months later.', 'The similarity of the evidence and accounts across cities, describing torture methods, interrogations and officers from Russia’s main intelligence agency, the F.S.B., has convinced Ukrainian prosecutors that abuses can be traced to the Russian leadership.', '“It cannot be that a soldier did this without an order,” Ms. Didenko said. The F.S.B. “came efficiently, knowing their job, tortured everyone on the genitals,” she said. “It’s surely a system.”', 'Many Ukrainians and their supporters say they believe Russia aims to crush Ukraine’s spirit of resistance and destroy its society.', '“It’s part of a genocide,” Ms. Didenko said, “but for us to prove it, we need time.”']"

The casualty estimates could not be independently confirmed, and militaries often exaggerate the losses of their enemies and downplay their own.

We must only fight, only keep going.”', 'He then adds: “Of course, there is still much that needs to be done.”', 'As winter sets in and the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine looms next month, Mr. Putin has dropped his earlier efforts to shield the public from the pain of war and is now seeking to prepare Russians, and his own military, for a long fight ahead.', '“He’s gotten a lot less relaxed, a lot less optimistic,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian analyst who studies Mr. Putin for her political analysis firm R.Politik. “You can sense a certain anxiety, a desire to mobilize all possible forces to achieve his goals.”', 'Keeping a low profile this week during Russia’s extended New Year’s holidays, Mr. Putin made no statement about Ukraine’s rocket attack in the city of Makiivka last weekend. The resulting torrent of criticism from pro-war bloggers on social media was aimed at Russian commanders and spared Mr. Putin himself, a pattern evident over months of blunders by Russia’s military.', 'Russia’s Defense Ministry issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the death toll from the strike had reached 89 servicemen, including the deputy commander of the regiment. Ukrainian officials have said the toll is much higher. Neither claim could be independently confirmed. The statement also said that the main reason the site was able to be targeted was cellphone use by soldiers — a factor that Russian military bloggers had pinpointed as a vulnerability.', 'A memorial service on Tuesday in the city of Samara, where many of the Makiivka victims were from, called for revenge against Ukraine, according to videos and local media reports. The reports did not mention any criticism of the officials responsible for the war.', 'Still, the unusually quick response by the Russian Defense Ministry, which acknowledged mass casualties in Makiivka a day after the attack and promised to provide “all necessary help and support” to the families of the dead, showed that the Kremlin is seeking to become more transparent at home than it was in the early months of the war.', 'It stood in contrast to the sinking last April of the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva. The Kremlin has never acknowledged that it was hit by Ukrainian missiles, or updated the toll it cited of one sailor killed and 27 missing, frustrating family members of the crew.', 'For much of last year, Mr. Putin projected an air of confidence while allowing life inside Russia to go on as normal. His compact with the public was straightforward: Leave the politics and the fighting to us, and you won’t feel significant pain from our justified “special military operation” in Ukraine.', 'That ended in September, when Ukraine’s counteroffensive stunned the Kremlin and Mr. Putin ordered a military draft that the war’s hard-line supporters described as long overdue. Now, Mr. Putin is doubling down on his efforts to draw Russian society further into the war effort.', 'The new approach was on stark display on Saturday, when Mr. Putin broke with tradition and gave his widely watched New Year’s Eve address not at the Kremlin, but at a military base, with people in uniform in the background.', 'The annual speech is typically heavy on apolitical platitudes — New Year’s dinner table fare for millions of Russian families. This time Mr. Putin served up his narrative of a West bent on destroying Russia. “The West lied about peace while preparing for aggression,” he said. “They are cynically using Ukraine and its people to weaken and divide Russia.”', 'It was the latest, and perhaps most striking, instance of Mr. Putin trying to prepare Russians for a long war.', 'American officials have said they see the Kremlin finally beginning to learn from its mistakes on the battlefield. Russia is improving its defenses and pushing more soldiers to the front lines, and has put a single general in charge of the war who was able to organize a retreat from the Ukrainian city of Kherson with minimal casualties in November.', 'Russian commanders are also publicly reining in their ambitions. Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the head of the Russian general staff, said on Dec. 22 that Russia’s current focus was limited to trying to capture the rest of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.', '“There’s less triumphalism,” Ruslan Leviev, a Russian military analyst for the Conflict Intelligence Team open-source analysis group, said in an interview. He said he was surprised by how quickly the Russian Defense Ministry had acknowledged the Makiivka losses, noting that the ministry usually takes days to admit large numbers of casualties — if it does so at all.', 'Mr. Putin himself appears to be putting a renewed focus on the home front: at once seeking to head off any potential discontent over the dire consequences of the war, and trying to mobilize Russians to more actively support it. In Russia, there are widespread rumors that Mr. Putin will soon order a new military draft to get more bodies to the front.', 'Western officials estimate that more than 100,000 Russian service members have been killed or wounded in the fighting, and the Russian Central Bank says the country’s economy contracted 3 percent in 2022.', 'For now, though, the suffering brought to Russia by the war has not translated into widespread discontent. The economy has been more resilient to Western sanctions than many expected, while the Kremlin’s television propaganda has been effective in helping convince many Russians that the invasion of Ukraine is, as Mr. Putin claims, a defensive war forced on Russia by the West.', 'While there was widespread outrage on social media over the deaths of Russian soldiers in Makiivka, there was little criticism inside Russia of Mr. Putin himself over the incident — and it went largely unmentioned on state television. Military bloggers said the high death toll could have been minimized if commanding officers had followed basic precautions, such as spreading out the recently arrived soldiers in safer locations, instead of clustering them near munitions.', 'At the memorial service in Samara, about 100 participants waved Russian flags and coordinated aid collection for survivors, according to videos and local media reports. Ukraine and the West were the targets of their outrage, not their own leaders.', '“The entire West has closed ranks against us in order to destroy us,” Yekaterina Kolotovkina, the head of a soldiers’ humanitarian fund and the wife of a Russian general fighting in Ukraine, told the Samara rally, echoing a main theme of state propaganda.', 'On social media, initial calls by pro-war Russian commentators to charge officials responsible for the Makiivka losses with treason gave way to more guarded criticism of local military decisions and advice for avoiding future disasters. None appeared to direct criticism toward Mr. Putin, with veiled attacks more often aimed at his senior officials.', 'The instinct to spare Mr. Putin of blame was evident in a post by an influential Russian military blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, a native of the Samara region, on Monday night. “Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich, we love our country,” she wrote, referring to Mr. Putin. “I love Russia so much that I hate specific characters in your entourage.”', 'But some analysts believe that an outpouring of protest could still come. Mikhail Vinogradov, a Russian political scientist, noted that the public backlash to military casualties in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s “didn’t happen right away, not in the first year of the war.”', 'The fact that a public backlash against Mr. Putin inside Russia has yet to materialize could mean one of two things, Mr. Vinogradov said: either the political system is “maximally stable,” or feelings of frustration are gradually building up and “could one day lead to an energetic outburst.”', '“Both hypotheses have a right to exist,” he said.', 'For the Kremlin, it is not only the war that could inject political volatility into this year. Russia’s next presidential election is scheduled for March 2024. While Mr. Putin would face no real electoral competition, the date has loomed large because analysts and members of the Russian elite have widely seen it as a moment by which Mr. Putin, 70, could make clear whom he wants to eventually succeed him.', 'Ms. Stanovaya, the analyst, said it was very likely that Mr. Putin would run again — constitutional changes made in 2020 allow him to stay in power until 2036. And she believes that tensions within two factions of the Russian elite — the hard-liners demanding an escalation of the war and the “pragmatists” seeking to avoid it — will only grow in the coming year.', '“I think 2023 will be decisive to a certain degree, determining which way the balance will tip,” Ms. Stanovaya said. “We are at a kind of dangerous line.”']"

James C. McConville, said in a mid-December interview at the air base, which shares a runway with an adjoining commercial airport named for the former Romanian prime minister, Mihail Kogalniceanu, near the Black Sea.', 'The troop deployment in Romania is meant as a warning to Moscow, part of President Biden’s pledge to defend “every single inch” of NATO territory without tempting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into escalating. But holding joint exercises is also a way of ensuring that allies in southeast Europe are ready to hold the line.', 'It is unclear what kind of footprint the United States will keep at the base; the Pentagon will soon decide whether to maintain the number of American troops and senior commanders there.', 'Some in Congress are wary of the cost of meeting Ukraine’s continuing demands for support — with the top House Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, suggesting in October that his party might be unwilling to write a “blank check” to Ukraine.', 'But supporters of maintaining a strong presence in Eastern Europe pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February as proof that the United States and its NATO allies did not do enough to deter Moscow last winter.', '“This is one of the most important lessons that we have to take away from Ukraine,” Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, told reporters after returning from a brief trip to Ukraine in early December. “When we look at the other scenario that might unfold like Ukraine, in the Pacific with China and Taiwan, we have to ensure that deterrence is successful.”', 'Military planners echoed that strategy, noting that the 101st Airborne Division was also using the Black Sea for coastal defense training — a useful skill should China ever become more aggressive and invade Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing has long claimed as its own.', 'The division was ordered to deploy about 4,000 soldiers and senior commanders just weeks after Russia invaded. They arrived at the air base, near the Romanian coastal city of Constanta, over the summer. The base previously served as a sleepy outpost for training NATO troops, including several hundred American soldiers, and was known more broadly in the military as a way station with a small mess hall for U.S. forces heading to and from Afghanistan.', 'The mission here is somewhat different from those elsewhere in Europe, where some U.S. troops are training Ukrainian forces on advanced weapons systems that are being shipped to the Ukrainians. The division’s commander, Maj. Gen. J.P. McGee, said that training with other Eastern European soldiers had its own value.', '“You get a chance to train and operate on the very ground that you might have to defend,” General McGee said.', 'He added: “You have to work with a NATO ally, and it’s almost unimaginable in the future that we would ever go fight without allies.”', 'In addition to the troops in Romania, General McGee has also sent smaller teams of soldiers to train with NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. The unit prides itself on being the closest one to the combat, but it is by no means the largest: Officials said that an estimated 12,000 troops attached to the Army’s First Infantry Division, added after the invasion, are based mostly in western Poland and the Baltics.', 'Together, they represent a buildup of U.S. forces in Europe since Russia invaded Ukraine, as Mr. Biden promised allies at a NATO summit meeting in Madrid in June.', 'As part of military exercises with American and British forces, Romanian troops have been testing the HIMARS rocket launching systems — the same weapons that have helped Ukraine push Russian forces into retreat — against simulated targets in the Black Sea over the past few months. Romania bought three of the rocket systems years ago, and officials said they are still in the process of being delivered.', 'Lt. Gen. Iulian Berdila, chief of the Romanian land forces — who has welcomed the deployment — said regional officials had been warning the West of “incremental and toxic” advances by Russia since it seized control of Crimea from Ukraine in a 2014 local referendum that much of the world views as illegal.', '“We’ve been very attentive to what Russia does, and what are the consequences,” General Berdila said. Of the training with U.S. troops, he said, “We’ve war-gamed together the different scenarios and are prepared to synchronize plans as we speak.”', 'The number and senior command level of American forces currently in Romania are enough, he said, for “predictable deterrence and defense together.”', 'General McConville would not predict what the Biden administration might do in Romania, but broadly speaking, he said the troops at the air base had “really made a difference, and I think we will continue to provide those capabilities as required.”', 'Having a division commander and staff so close to the border with Ukraine is more than symbolic, said Becca Wasser, a war analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a research institute in Washington. It allows for quick decisions about where to position thousands of troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.', '“What you are seeing is indicative of a change in how the U.S. military is approaching posture and deployments around the globe as the era of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have changed,” Ms. Wasser said. “It’s not necessarily going to be this combat deployment — what you really have is a deterrence deployment.”', 'It is the same kind of mission, Ms. Wasser said, that was undertaken by tens of thousands of American troops sent to bases across the U.S. Central Command in 2020 as tensions with Iran flared across the Middle East.', 'For Command Sgt. Maj. Vitalia Sanders, who leads a battalion at Mihail Kogalniceanu air base, the mission is as personal as it is professional.', 'She was born in a town outside Uzhhorod, in western Ukraine, and moved to northwest Indiana when she was 12 to live with her grandmother. She was last in Ukraine in 2005, and her brother is still there — although their communications over WhatsApp and Facebook have been limited because Russian strikes have taken out power grids.', 'Sergeant Major Sanders has been in the U.S. Army for 21 years, and served in Afghanistan and Kuwait. But she never forgot the threat that Russia posed to Ukraine.', '“Just being here, so close to home,” she said, “makes me hungry and makes me fight, and hopefully spreads that energy to soldiers to let them know how important this is for everybody.”']"

A former Russian paramilitary commander in Ukraine, Igor Girkin, wrote on the Telegram app that “many hundreds” were dead and wounded and that many “remained under the rubble.”', 'Ukrainian military officials said it appeared that “about 400” Russian troops had been killed, though they did not explicitly say that Kyiv was behind the attack.', 'None of the claims could be independently verified, but even the lowest number would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode in the war, and an embarrassment for President Vladimir V. Putin. He has vowed repeatedly to correct the glaring errors and weaknesses in his armed forces that the war has exposed, and in a New Year’s Eve speech filmed at a military base, Mr. Putin told the families of soldiers killed in the fighting, “I share your pain with all my heart.”', 'Pro-war Russian bloggers and some government officials said the debacle was caused by the military’s own repeated and costly mistakes, like garrisoning troops in a dense concentration within range of Ukrainian artillery, placing them in the same building as an ammunition depot, and allowing them to use cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians can use to zero in on their target.', '“Our generals are untrainable in principle,” wrote Mr. Girkin, who has used the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov.', 'Some pro-war lawmakers demanded an investigation, and one of them, Sergei Mironov, leader of a pro-Kremlin party in the Parliament, called for  the prosecution of all officials responsible, “whether they wear epaulets or not.”', '“Obviously neither intelligence nor counterintelligence or air defense worked properly,” he said.', 'The attack was “a massive blow,” said a spokesman for the Russian-installed proxy government in the Donetsk region, Daniil Bezsonov. “The enemy inflicted the most serious defeats in this war on us not because of their coolness and talent, but because of our mistakes,” he wrote in a Telegram post.', 'More than 10 months after an invasion that Russians — and many Ukrainians — thought would produce a quick Russian victory, each side has suffered more than 100,000 killed and wounded, by Western estimates, and the war has become one of attrition, with no evidence of an end in sight.', 'Some of the heaviest recent fighting has ravaged the Donetsk region, one of four the Kremlin claimed to annex in September even as its troops were losing ground there, giving up towns they had seized earlier in the war. Since then combat in the region has slowed to a bloody slog, as the Ukrainians look for places to press their advantage, while Russians build trenches and fortifications along the front lines and try to capture the city of Bakhmut.', ""On Monday, Russia launched a flurry of Iranian-made exploding drones at Ukraine, continuing its barrage against cities and civilian infrastructure, especially the power grid. But it appeared that Ukraine's increasingly effective air defenses once again minimized the damage."", 'The Ukrainian military said on Monday that 22 drones were shot down over Kyiv in the early-morning hours, but at least two loud explosions were heard in the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said some energy infrastructure facilities had been damaged, affecting systems that heat buildings. It was not clear if the explosions were caused by drones that evaded air defenses, by drones that were shot down but detonated on hitting the ground, or by air defense missiles.', 'The Ukraine military said it had shot down all 45 Iranian Shahed drones launched over the weekend, though some cruise missiles penetrated its defenses.', 'In his nightly video address, President Volodomyr Zelensky warned on Monday, “We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,” aiming to exhaust Ukraine’s defenses and its ability to endure. He said, “Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive.”', 'The deadly attack on Russian forces in Makiivka used the HIMARS rocket artillery to hit a vocational school where troops were housed, Moscow said.  The Russian Defense Ministry said that four HIMARS rockets had hit the building, and that two others had been shot down by Russian air defenses.', 'As pro-war bloggers and officials reacted with fury, video posted on social media showed firefighters amid the ruins of the structure, reduced to smoking piles of rubble. The bloggers have become influential opinion-makers in Russia amid the censorship of mainstream media.', 'Mr. Girkin, the blogger and former paramilitary commander, wrote that the vocational school in Makiivka had been “almost completely destroyed” because “ammunition stored in the same building” detonated in the strike. The ammunition was stored “without the slightest sign of disguise,” he wrote, adding that similar strikes had occurred earlier this year, albeit with fewer casualties.', 'Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, noted that the Russian officials “do not typically provide this type of information after a major loss, which suggests they want to control the narrative on this event.”', 'Makiivka, adjacent to the city of Donetsk, lies only about 10 miles from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory, the town of Avdiivka to the northwest — well within the roughly 50-mile range of the HIMARS rockets the United States has sent to Ukraine. A U.S. military official declined to comment on the strike.', 'HIMARS, which fires satellite-guided rockets from mobile launchers, is part of a growing arsenal of sophisticated Western weapons that have helped Ukraine change the course of the conflict.', 'Since the Biden administration began supplying the weapons system in June, HIMARS has greatly increased the range and precision of the outgunned Ukrainians. They have used it to hit targets far behind the front lines, like the main bridge linking the city of Kherson to Russian-held territory, which contributed to the Russian decision to abandon the city.', 'Last month, a Ukrainian HIMARS attack destroyed a hotel in the city of Kadiivka, in the Luhansk region northeast of Donetsk. That attack killed members of Kremlin-aligned Wagner paramilitary group who were using the hotel as a base, according to Ukrainian authorities in the region.', 'The HIMARS system is most effective when used against stationary targets that can be identified in advance and pinpointed, such as ammunition dumps, infrastructure or troop concentrations. The United States has so far supplied Ukraine with at least 20 HIMARS systems, which are made by Lockheed Martin.', 'Many soldiers who were casualties appeared to be new recruits, recently mobilized in Mr. Putin’s drive to conscript more men into the fighting in Ukraine. One report in Russian state media said that “active use of cellular phones by the newly arrived servicemen” had been a prime reason for the attack, helping Ukrainian forces to pinpoint their location.', 'Throughout the war, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have spoken on open cellphone lines, often revealing their positions and exposing the disarray in their ranks. Though the continued use of the phones, despite the devastating consequences, exposes a failing by the military command, military bloggers say this explanation shifts the blame onto the victims.', 'It does not address why Russian commanders housed so many conscripts in an unprotected building within reach of U.S.-made rockets.', '“No one is assuming the responsibility for the needless deaths,” one blogger, Anastasia Kashevarova, wrote on Telegram.']"

No more than 25 to 30 percent of the buildings in the city of Lyman are totally beyond repair, he estimated, meaning there is a lot of work to be done to preserve the rest.', 'On the heels of intense bombardment early in the war, Russian occupation in the spring and summer, and Ukrainian liberation in the fall, the emergency department’s staff is slowly getting reacquainted with a radically different city. There are fewer resources and workers, and temperatures continue to plummet, making conditions extremely challenging.', 'Earlier this month, journalists from The New York Times spent a day with the firefighters from Station No. 21 as they repaired buildings and responded to a house fire in Lyman, offering a brief window into a Ukrainian city that sits between its destruction and, hopefully, reconstruction. The sound of shelling at the front line was not far off.', '“We are adults, we understand our service, what’s required,” said Mr. Liakh, clean-shaven and tired.', 'As the war moves into the coldest months, winter has become a weapon of its own. Russia’s relentless strikes on Ukraine’s infrastructure have left thousands without power, freezing in basements and huddled around wood stoves. On Thursday, Moscow launched one of its largest attacks yet with a flurry of drones and cruise missiles that targeted the country’s energy grid in Kyiv and other major cities.', 'Near the front lines, in towns and cities that have been mostly without power for months, freezing temperatures are a part of life. Residents survive by hoarding wood, rationing generator fuel and bundling up. In the battlefield trenches, Ukrainian and Russian soldiers contend with frostbite, hypothermia and weeks of cold meals — constantly exposed to slick mud and knee-deep puddles on warmer days, and hard, frozen ground during the colder nights.', 'The afternoon call for Station 21’s small crew earlier this month came shortly before the cook finished preparing a hearty lunch of noodles and meat in an aging, Soviet-era field kitchen out back. A house was on fire in the city’s north. Lunch would have to wait.', 'It was miraculous that the station had received the emergency call at all. At around 11 that morning, the city’s cell towers were shut down as maintenance workers began their daily repair on Lyman’s power grid. The fire, which began around 1, was seen by a neighbor who had a few bars of cell signal.', 'But instead of reaching Lyman’s emergency dispatch number, the person contacted a nearby city’s dispatch, which then reached Station 21 by Starlink, a satellite internet service in wide use across Ukraine, especially in combat areas. The crew’s aging, red and white Soviet-model fire truck rumbled to the scene.', 'When they arrived at the modest home, the fire was manageable. Clad in body armor — a reminder that the threat of shelling in Lyman remained — the firefighters moved to extinguish the blaze. The fire was small, so they didn’t run out of water this time.', '“The house is abandoned, the owner went somewhere and some homeless person stayed here overnight, heating the stove,” said Serhiy, 43, a tall and weathered safety inspector.', '“The stove was ruined, but he was trying to get warm anyway,” he said, standing in the yard as his colleagues descended from the roof and rolled back the fire hose. “He kindled the fire and ran away. The neighbors saw it in time.”', 'With a broken window, a hole in the roof and some dilapidated walls, the house stood mostly intact. Several others on the street had suffered worse fates, reduced by shelling to piles of rubble or black husks. The neighborhood had been ravaged in the fighting, but was considered the less damaged part of the city.', 'As the Russians advanced in spring, they showered the southern section of Lyman with artillery fire and missile strikes, turning the neighborhood of multistory houses into an apocalyptic ghost town. Hundreds of windows in the tall, off-white residential buildings bared their splintered glass teeth. A medical university building crumbled onto itself like a cardboard box hit by a fist, and one of the wings of the city hospital had a hole in the roof and a wall that was two floors deep.', 'Still, about three thousand people from a prewar population of 24,000 had remained in Lyman, calling the bombed-out set piece their home.', 'Winter is a hazardous time for fires, said Serhiy. Most are caused by makeshift heating systems people use to try to stay warm, he said, some in damaged houses.', 'Members of the Lyman Emergency Service, who left with the last evacuees before the Russian occupation in late May, were among the first people to return after Ukraine retook the city in early October. The Russians retreated along with the emergency response crew they had planted at Station 21, comprising mostly Russians but also apparently a few workers recruited from the Ukrainian crew.', 'During the occupation, the station’s garage bay was shelled and an ambulance within it caught fire; the smoke turned the walls and ceiling black.', '“As soon as I knew that Lyman was about to be liberated, I knew that we were going to be summoned,” said Mr. Liakh. Before the Russian occupation, Station 21 had newer vehicles and around 120 staff members. Now there are only about 50 workers, after some fled with the retreating Russians.', 'The divided loyalties among the close-knit emergency workers is rarely discussed, but those who returned following Lyman’s liberation likened those who stayed and worked for the Russians to traitors.', '“It’s the same as if a Ukrainian soldier would go to the Russian army to serve against Ukraine,” Mr. Liakh said.', 'Like Serhiy, the inspector, Mr. Liakh returned to Lyman without his family members, anticipating the challenges that awaited the residents of Lyman in winter. “I was ready for everything,” he added.', 'In a city as heavily damaged as Lyman, people’s lives have been focused on everyday survival for many months. Some of the challenges they face routinely have only recently dawned on people who just had their infrastructure destroyed.', '“De-occupied territories close to the frontline are prepared to winter better than the whole Ukraine,” said Serhiy Lipskyi, the deputy head of the Emergency Service of the Lyman territorial community.', '“People here knew that the winter was coming, and they would not have electricity, or gas, or heating — nothing,” he added.', 'Some residents moved from the bombed southern area to the houses of relatives, or into abandoned homes, in other parts of the city, hoping that it would be easier to survive there. Others lived as members of communes in the basements of multistory buildings, formed when people spent months hiding underground from heavy shelling.', 'Kateryna, an older woman who manages some of the humanitarian aid flowing into the city from an abandoned kindergarten, moved from her apartment to the home of her mother-in-law so she could keep warm with a wood stove.', '“We were told there is no heating in the apartments and there won’t be any,” she said. “It’s OK. We’ll survive, we’ll manage. We’ll break through.”']"

It said its defense forces had shot down 54 of 69 cruise missiles and had also knocked out drones.', 'The attack appeared likely to prompt new calls from Ukrainian officials for more Western air-defense systems, given that the growing arsenal of advanced weapons sent by Kyiv’s allies has failed to stop Moscow’s debilitating attacks on energy infrastructure that have caused widespread power outages as the country faces freezing winter temperatures.', 'After the strikes, Russia’s Defense Ministry released a picture on its official channel on Telegram, the social messaging app, showing a Kalibr cruise missile and a message: “Kalibrs will never run out.”', 'The White House condemned the strikes as part of Russia’s “barbaric war” and pledged to continue to help Ukraine defend itself. “This is another example of Putin’s brutality, attacking Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, which provides light and heat to Ukrainian civilians,” Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.', 'The new wave of strikes frustrated anew the work of crews trying to repair Ukraine’s power grid and raised the prospect that many Ukrainians would be without power for the New Year holidays.', 'For three months, Russia has launched volleys of cruise missiles and drones at Ukraine’s energy grid, in what military analysts say is a strategy of plunging the country into cold and darkness to lower morale.', 'The latest bombardment killed two people and wounded four others, including a 14-year-old girl hit by falling debris, the authorities said.', 'Air-defense weapons shot down four of six cruise missiles near the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, but the two that got through hit power plants, knocking out 90 percent of the city’s electricity, the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, said in an interview.', '“Putin uses the scenario of demoralizing the Ukrainian people,” Mr. Sadovyi said.', 'But Lviv will hold out, he said. Diesel generators switched on in hospitals so operations could continue, he said, and the city is well stocked with firewood for emergency heating shelters.', 'Amid the barrage, two provinces — Dnipropetrovsk, in central Ukraine, and Odesa in the south — pre-emptively switched off electricity to limit damage in case the grid short-circuited in a strike, a utility company said in a statement. In Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the strikes had left 40 percent of the capital without electricity.', 'Amid the mayhem in the sky, as missiles and drones streaked in and Ukraine fired air defense missiles in response, a Ukrainian S-300 interceptor missile flew into Belarus and was shot down by that country’s military, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said. There was no immediate information about casualties and no indication that Belarus, a close Russian ally, would treat the incident as anything other than a mishap. In November, an errant Ukrainian air-defense missile landed in Poland, killing two people and briefly raising fears that the conflict might expand.', 'In Ukraine, the attack began with air-raid sirens sounding at about 5:30 a.m. The Ukrainian military’s southern command said two Russian ships in the Black Sea had shown signs that they were preparing to launch missiles, setting off the alarms.', 'As the sun rose, reports of strikes came in from cities around the country, and seven or eight explosions rang out in Kyiv. One rattled windows and set off car alarms in the city center.', 'Leonid Fatkulin, 79, was still in bed on the first floor of his two-story brick home in an outlying district when the missiles struck. “I was going to get up and shave when the explosion shook the house,” he said.', 'A natural gas pipeline caught fire.', '“It’s not a war,” Mr. Fatkulin said, standing beside the remains of his house, a coat thrown over his bathrobe. “It’s a crime against humanity.”', 'In Kyiv, Mayor Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian air defenses had shot down 16 missiles over the city but that falling debris had wounded three people, including the teenage girl.', 'The Ukrainian general staff headquarters said in a statement that Russia had launched 13 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones at energy infrastructure in Kharkiv, and that air defense systems had shot down all but two. Another five Shahed drones were shot down around the city of Dnipro in southeastern Ukraine, the military said.', 'The cruise missiles followed, striking after Ukraine’s air defense forces had been firing at the drones. The Russian military launched the missiles from several directions, firing from airplanes and ships at sea, the air force statement said.', 'But Ukraine is now able to fight back with a growing and increasingly sophisticated arsenal of air defense weapons.', 'The Pentagon has delivered the first two of eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, which are equipped with radar-guided missiles capable of hitting drones and cruise missiles. Germany supplied the first of four ultramodern Iris-T systems, which are so new that they had never been used on the battlefield, while France and the Netherlands also pledged additional air-defense missiles.', 'Visiting Washington last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was offered a battery of Patriot missiles, the United States’ most advanced ground-based missile defense system. But it is likely to be several months before Ukrainian crews are trained and it is deployed.', 'Ukraine’s air defense capability has been one of the surprise successes of the war, as improved coordination between early-warning systems and the ground-based units responsible for shooting down rockets has helped Kyiv’s forces stop a large percentage of Russian strikes.', 'But Russia’s barrages are often so overwhelming — about 75 missiles are launched in a typical barrage, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency has said — that plenty still get through. And Russia appears to have more weapons in its stockpile, due in part to the growing supply of exploding drones from Iran.', 'And even successful shoot-downs pose risks as the twisted, silvery metallic debris rains down on cities.', 'On Thursday, two fragments landed in a playground in the Pechersk neighborhood of Kyiv.', '“It was a first for us that it was so close,” said Galina Khomina, a graphic designer who was pushing her 3-year-old daughter, Nastya, on a swing set in the playground a few hours after the strikes. She said she couldn’t stay home in fear, despite the near miss.', '“We hope it will end soon,” Ms. Khomina said. “We are used to it, and we are not afraid. Life goes on. You only have one life.”']"

They sit down at a cafe with their children. They are everywhere.”', 'He said that the size of this year’s influx had caused housing prices to triple and allowed Russian real estate brokers to charge property owners, mainly Russians, exorbitant fees and cut out their Turkish competitors.', '“People think they are tourists and will go back after the war,” he said. “I don’t believe that because Antalya is really like heaven.

That drew a frosty response from the Kremlin, with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov saying that Kyiv must accept all of Russia’s demands, including that it give up four Ukrainian regions that Moscow claims to have annexed.', '“Otherwise,” he said, “the Russian Army will deal with this issue.”', 'Russia does not fully control any of those regions, and has even lost territory there in recent months as Ukrainian forces fight to reclaim all the land seized by Moscow. But on Wednesday, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said it was impossible to accept a peace plan that did not recognize those four Ukrainian regions as part of Russia.', '“Any plan that does not take into account these circumstances cannot claim to be a peace plan,” Mr. Peskov said, according to the state-run Tass news agency.', 'The hard-line positions suggest that both sides believe they have more to gain on the battlefield, analysts say.', '“This suggests there is not necessarily a push for a negotiated peace or even some sort of negotiations, but still a push for whatever endgame is being sought militarily,” said Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and Eastern European politics at the University of Oxford.', 'Ukraine holds the momentum, having retaken much of the land that Russia captured early in the war. But Moscow’s forces still occupy large chunks of the east and south, and Russia is readying more troops and launching aerial attacks on infrastructure, deepening Ukrainians’ misery even as Russian soldiers struggle on the ground.', 'On Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said that Russia had launched a barrage of strikes at the southern city of Kherson, including one that damaged a maternity ward, as officials continued to urge on residents to evacuate. Images shared by one Ukrainian official after the strike showed blown-out windows, a hole in the roof and piles of rubble in one of the rooms.', 'Kherson has been battered by shelling since Ukraine retook the city last month, with Russian forces using new positions on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River to launch near daily barrages at the city.', 'The war has now passed its 300th day. There have been no peace talks between Ukraine and Russia since the early weeks of the conflict, which began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, and both sides have signaled a determination to keep fighting.', 'Visiting Washington last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that weapons and aid from the United States and allies would help Ukraine sustain its resistance well into 2023, emphasizing that “we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield.”', 'And President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in a brief televised interview over the weekend, said that he was prepared to negotiate over “acceptable outcomes,” but insisted that “99.9 percent of our citizens” are “ready to sacrifice everything for the interests of the Motherland.”', 'Western officials have dismissed Mr. Putin’s periodic offers to negotiate as empty gestures. In calling for talks without hinting that he is prepared to abandon his onslaught — and repeating a propaganda line that Russia is fighting a defensive war for its own survival — Mr. Putin is trying to send the message that Russia will eventually win, and that the sooner Ukraine capitulates, the fewer people will die.', '“They are both in it for the long haul,” said Karin von Hippel\u200b, director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a military research institute in London. “Putin still feels he can win this. He still has more men and more money, although you wonder what his tipping point will be.”', 'While Russia’s losses are believed to be enormous — more than 100,000 killed and injured, American officials have said — Mr. Putin has signaled recently that he is prepared to accept many more. He told senior military officials in a televised meeting last week that of the 300,000 reserves called up this fall, half were still at training bases and represented a “strategic reserve” for future fighting.', 'On Wednesday, Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said that his country’s economy had contracted by 2 percent over the past 11 months. That is a smaller decline than many experts had predicted at the start of the war, and suggests that Moscow has so far managed to weather the effects of Western sanctions.', 'This month, Mr. Putin emphasized that there were “no limits” to Russia’s military spending. ', 'But as the evidence of Russian military atrocities has multiplied — and with Ukraine’s continued battlefield success — Kyiv’s negotiating position has hardened.', 'In late March, weeks after the invasion and with Russian troops still threatening to seize the capital, Ukrainian negotiators at a meeting in Istanbul proposed adopting neutral status — in effect abandoning a bid to join NATO, which Russia has long opposed — in exchange for security guarantees from other nations.', 'They also suggested separate talks on the status of Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and of Donbas, the eastern area claimed by Moscow.', 'Those terms are now off the table.', '“The emotional background in Ukraine has changed very, very much,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, told the BBC in August. “We have seen too many war crimes.”', 'Last month, addressing a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 nations, Mr. Zelensky presented a 10-point “formula for peace” that called for Russia’s full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and Donbas.', 'It also demanded an international tribunal to try Russian war crimes; Moscow’s release of all political prisoners and those forcibly deported during the war; compensation from Russia for war damages; and steps by the international community to ensure the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants and to provide for its food and energy security.', 'Demanding maximum concessions is a time-honored negotiating tactic, but analysts say that Ukraine is eager to demonstrate — particularly to European allies that are enduring higher energy costs this winter because of a Russian oil embargo — that it sees a path out of the conflict.', '“The Ukrainian proposal offers a glimpse at Ukraine’s vision of how the war with Russia could one day end,” said Stella Ghervas, a professor of Russian history at Newcastle University in Britain. In the wars of modern European history, she said, winners on the battlefield have often been the ones to push hardest for peace.', '“In the Napoleonic wars, World War I and World War II, the successful military leaders and peacemakers were often the same individuals,” she said. “Those who sought peace were the same who had successfully fought the war. The serious initiatives for peacemaking during the great wars in Europe have come always from the strongest party on the battlefield.”', 'Still, Ukraine’s peace proposals have received a generally cautious response. When Mr. Zelensky mentioned his plan at a joint news conference with President Biden last week, Mr. Biden did not comment on the proposal, saying only that the United States and Ukraine “share the exact same vision” for peace.', 'On Wednesday, the French defense minister, Sébastien Lecornu, visited the Ukrainian capital for the first time since the war began, following a pledge by President Emmanuel Macron to send more weapons to Ukraine. Mr. Lecornu laid a wreath at a monument to Ukrainians who have died in the war.', 'Many in Ukraine and in Eastern Europe have been critical of France’s response to the war, drawing a link between its relatively limited military support and Mr. Macron’s approach to Russia. While unequivocally backing the Ukrainian cause, Mr. Macron has said “we must not humiliate Russia” and called security guarantees for Russia an “essential” part of peace talks.', 'Mr. Zelensky said this week that he had sought India’s help on the peace plan in a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government holds the Group of 20 rotating chair and has been mentioned as a possible mediator in talks. Mr. Modi “conveyed India’s support for any peace efforts,” but did not mention the Ukrainian plan.', 'Another potential interlocutor is Turkey, which this summer brokered a deal involving Russia, Ukraine and the United Nations to allow for the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. That agreement, along with occasional exchanges of prisoners between Ukraine and Russia, has offered hope that the two sides could one day discuss a cease-fire.', 'But analysts say that Russia must demonstrate that it will negotiate in good faith and act on the terms of any peace agreement in order to earn some level of trust by Ukraine, which it has invaded twice in less than a decade.', '“Ukraine will always be a neighbor of Russia,” said Ms. Howlett, the Oxford lecturer. “Any peace settlement has to come with the acknowledgment and understanding that Russia isn’t going anywhere.”']"

The administration has accelerated its moves to deprive Iran of the Western-made components needed to manufacture the drones being sold to Russia after it became apparent from examining the wreckage of intercepted drones that they are stuffed with made-in-America technology.', 'U.S. forces are helping Ukraine’s military to target the sites where the drones are being prepared for launch — a difficult task because the Russians are moving the launch sites around, from soccer fields to parking lots. And the Americans are rushing in new technologies designed to give early warning of approaching drone swarms, to improve Ukraine’s chances of bringing them down, with everything from gunfire to missiles.', 'But all three approaches have run into deep challenges, and the drive to cut off critical parts for the drones is already proving as difficult as the decades-old drive to deprive Iran of the components needed to build the delicate centrifuges it uses to enrich near-bomb-grade uranium. The Iranians, American intelligence officials have said in recent weeks, are applying to the drone program their expertise about how to spread nuclear centrifuge manufacturing around the country and to find “dual use” technologies on the black market to sidestep export controls.', 'In fact, one of the Iranian companies named by Britain, France and Germany as a key manufacturer of one of the two types of drones being bought by the Russians, Qods Aviation, has appeared for years on the United Nations’ lists of suppliers to Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. The company, which is owned by Iran’s military, has expanded its line of drones despite waves of sanctions.', 'The administration’s scramble to deal with the Iranian-supplied drones comes at a significant moment in the war, just as Ukraine is using its own drones to strike deep into Russia, including an attack this week on a base housing some of the country’s strategic bombers. And it comes as officials in Washington and London warn that Iran may be about to provide Russia with missiles, helping alleviate Moscow’s acute shortage.', 'Officials across the Western alliance say they are convinced that Iran and Russia, both isolated by American-led sanctions, are building a new alliance of convenience. One senior military official said that partnership had deepened quickly, after Iran’s agreement to supply drones to the Russians last summer “bailed Putin out.”', 'The Biden administration, having abandoned hopes of reviving the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran, has been adding new sanctions every few weeks.', 'In the effort to stop the drone attacks, Mr. Biden’s aides are also engaging an ally with a long history of undermining Iran’s nuclear program: Israel.', 'In a secure video meeting last Thursday with Israel’s top national security, military and intelligence officials, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, “discussed Iran’s growing military relationship with Russia, including the transfer of weapons the Kremlin is deploying against Ukraine, targeting its civilian infrastructure and Russia’s provision of military technology to Iran in return,” the White House said in a statement outlining the meeting. The statement did not offer details about how the two countries decided to address the issue.', 'But the fact that the administration chose to highlight the discussion, in a quarterly meeting normally focused on disrupting Iran’s nuclear capabilities, was notable. Israel and the United States have a long history of operating together in dealing with technological threats emanating from Tehran. Together they developed one of the world’s most famous and sophisticated cyberattacks, using computer code that was later called “Stuxnet,” to attack Iran’s nuclear centrifuge facilities.', 'Since then, Israel has made little secret of its attempts to sabotage nuclear enrichment centers.', 'In a statement, Adrienne Watson, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, acknowledged the scope of the broad drive against Iran’s drone program.', '“We are looking at ways to target Iranian U.A.V. production through sanctions, export controls, and talking to private companies whose parts have been used in the production,” she said, using the acronym for “unmanned aerial vehicles.”', 'She added, “We are assessing further steps we can take in terms of export controls to restrict Iran’s access to technologies used in drones.”', 'Iran’s interest in drones dates back more than three decades, as the country looked for ways that it could monitor, and harass, ships in the Persian Gulf. The Mohajer I, a predecessor to one of the drones now being sold to the Russians, made its first flight in 1986.', 'Progress was slow, but may have been aided in 2011 when the Central Intelligence Agency took a stealthy, unarmed RQ-170 from the Pentagon’s fleet in Afghanistan and flew it over Iran, in what appeared to be an effort to map some of the hundreds of tunnels dug by the Iranians to hide elements of their nuclear program.', 'A malfunction led to the aircraft landing in the desert, and President Obama briefly considered sending in a Navy SEAL team to blow it up before it fell into the hands of Iranian engineers, senior officials later reported. He decided not to take the risk, and within days the Iranians paraded the drone through the streets of Tehran, a propaganda victory.', 'But American intelligence officials later concluded that the aircraft likely proved a bonanza for Iranian drone designers, who could reverse engineer the craft.', 'It was not until 2016 that Iran announced it was beginning to develop attack drones, some in cooperation with Russia. Many of the first were placed in the hands of Iranian-backed militias, including Houthi rebels in Yemen, and they were used most effectively in 2019 in attacks on two Saudi oil processing facilities run by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.', 'American officials said the experiences in Saudi Arabia, and the targeting of American forces in Syria and elsewhere, gave them an appreciation of Iranian drone capabilities, and the challenge of dealing with kamikaze raids in which a small explosive is secured in the drone’s nose. But the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine underscored that Iran knew how to mass produce the aircraft, a particular worry at a moment when there are discussions of opening an Iranian plant inside Russia.', 'The Iranian program has hardly been without its problems. Deliveries so far have come episodically, as Russia and Iran retrofitted the drones to operate in the cold of a Ukrainian winter. And Iran has run into supply chain issues, a problem the United States is seeking to worsen.', 'Nonetheless, despite years of sanctions on Iran’s defense sector, Iranian drones still are built largely with American and Western parts. When photographs began to circulate of circuit boards from downed drones, visibly packed with chips from American manufacturers, the White House ordered a crackdown, including calls to the firms whose products had been discovered. Almost all had the same reaction: These are unrestricted, “dual use” items whose circulation is almost impossible to stop.', 'The Biden administration is trying anyway.', 'In September, the administration tightened sanctions, specifically naming companies involved with building the aircraft for Russia. That was followed by further action in November against companies like Safiran Airport Services, a Tehran-based firm that it accused of shipping the drones on behalf of the Russian government.', 'In November, the Treasury Department sanctioned two companies based in the United Arab Emirates, a key U.S. ally, accusing them of collaborating with Safiran. ', 'Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va., said that the sanctions were hardly an instant solution.', '“Export controls are going to have an effect, but you have to be realistic about the timelines on which they will work,” Mr. Kofman said.', '“Sanctions delay and make costly acquisition of components,” he said. “But determined countries will get their hands on tech for narrow defense applications, or adjust their weapon designs to what they can get, even if it’s less reliable.”', 'As the war grinds on, the United States, Britain, France and Germany are pressing the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, to open a formal investigation into whether Russia and Iran are, together, violating the terms of a U.N. restriction on the export of sophisticated arms from Iran.', 'Mr. Guterres has made clear that his top priority is executing a deal with Russia over the export of Ukrainian grain, to alleviate shortages, and his aides say now is not the time to risk that agreement with an investigation whose conclusion seems predictable.', 'Iran appears to be flying drones to Russian forces on cargo aircraft, usually over routes that leave little opportunity to intercept them. That means attempting to attack them on the ground — no easy task.', 'Until a little more than a month ago, American and British government officials say, the drones were largely based in Crimea. Then they disappeared for a number of days, reappearing in Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia province. The movements have been tracked by American and Ukrainian officials, some sitting side by side in military intelligence centers. But the drones are highly mobile, with launch systems mounted on trucks, and the Russians know they are being hunted — so they move them to safer locations, which makes tracking and striking them a difficult proposition.', '“The change of launch site is likely due to Russian concerns about the vulnerability of Crimea, while it is also convenient for resupply from the weapons’ likely arrival point in Russia, at Astrakhan,” a British military assessment earlier this month said.', 'There is growing evidence that the military relationship may be a two-way street. Britain has accused Russia of planning to give Iran advanced military components in exchange for hundreds of drones.', '“Iran has become one of Russia’s top military backers,” Britain’s defense minister, Ben Wallace, told Parliament last week.', '“In return for having supplied more than 300 kamikaze drones, Russia now intends to provide Iran with advanced military components, undermining both Middle East and international security — we must expose that deal,” Mr. Wallace said.', 'A number of American companies — including the Edgesource Corporation and BlueHalo, both based in Virginia — have provided training or technology to help detect and defeat the Russian drones, U.S. officials said.', 'Edgesource has donated about $2 million in systems, including one called Windtalkers, to help Ukraine locate, identify and track incoming hostile drones more than 20 miles away, while at the same time identifying Ukraine’s own drones in the same airspace, said Joseph Urbaniak, the company’s chief operating officer.', 'The United States has provided Ukraine with other technology to counter drones, most recently as part of a $275 million shipment of arms and equipment the Pentagon announced on Dec. 9. But American officials have declined to provide details on the specific assistance, citing operational security.']"

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has called conquering and annexing the Donbas the heart of the war effort.', 'Since enduring a series of humiliating retreats, the Russian military has fortified its lines near Kreminna with a series of defensive barriers, part of its effort to solidify its positions up and down a jagged front that stretches for hundreds of miles. Retaking the city and other towns nearby would expand the Ukrainians’ foothold in the region, and give them control of major roads leading to Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.', '“The situation there is difficult, acute,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said of Kreminna and other areas in eastern Ukraine, in his nightly address late Monday. “The occupiers are using all the resources available to them — and these are significant resources — to squeeze out at least some advance.”', 'Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian regional governor of Luhansk Province, said on Monday that in response to military pressure, part of the Russian command in Kreminna had withdrawn to the town of Rubizhne, a few miles to the southeast, although it was not possible to verify the claim. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defense will ‘fall,’” he said in a Telegram post on Tuesday.', 'Vitaly Kiselyov, a Russian-backed official in occupied Luhansk, said on Russian state television on Monday that the situation around Kreminna and another small city nearby, Svatove, remained “very tense.”', 'The Ukrainian counterattack in the east comes as the country’s battered economy shows new signs of the war’s toll, leaving it ever more dependent on Western aid. The Ukrainian government has struggled to raise money on bond markets, unable to roll over debt accumulated before Russia invaded in late February, and since then has paid investors about $2.2 billion more than it collected in bond sales, the Central Bank said.', 'Overall, Ukraine’s economy is projected to shrink about 40 percent this year, as Russia occupies about a fifth of its territory, hammers its cities with cruise missiles, and batters critical industries like steel manufacturing and agriculture.', 'All of that has left Ukrainian public finance, which has been wobbly at the best of times during three decades of independence, deeply reliant on assistance from the United States, the European Union, European countries that donate individually and other donors.', 'The International Monetary Fund, which bailed out Ukraine through a long run of post-independence financial crises, has not continued large-scale lending during the war. “If the I.M.F. is worried about debt sustainability and ability to finance, imagine what private investors are thinking,” said Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister who is a professor at the Kyiv School of Economics.', 'Russia’s economy has also suffered over the 10 months of war, though it has not collapsed under the pressure of punishing Western sanctions. This week, Russian and Ukrainian leaders again suggested that they were open to peace talks, but only on terms that were dismissed by their counterparts.', 'Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that his government wanted a “peace summit,” mediated by the United Nations, but that Russia could not be invited until it faced war crimes prosecution. Mr. Putin said he was willing to negotiate — but days earlier he restated a determination to keep fighting, and he has insisted that lands captured by his forces must remain Russian forever.', 'On Tuesday, Mr. Putin showed no sign that he expected the war, or acrimonious relations with the West, to soon abate. He met with the president of Belarus, raising concerns that he would use that nation — again — to launch an attack on Ukraine. And he signed a long-expected decree that banned sales of oil to nations that imposed a price cap on Russian oil: the European Union and its members, the United States, Britain, Japan, Canada and Australia.', 'In the absence of diplomacy, Ukraine and Russia’s militaries have been struggling against each other, and muddy winter weather, to seize more ground and entrench what they hold.', 'Ukraine’s campaign to recapture Kreminna began in the fall, as its forces finished sweeping through the country’s northeastern Kharkiv region and turned south to focus on Luhansk, which was almost entirely under Russian control.', 'Since then, the sides have fought a series of battles and artillery duels over highways and villages around Kreminna and Svatove. Russian forces took over both places not long after their full-scale invasion began, and have severed pontoon bridges over a river and built layers of defensive lines to shore up the front.', 'Ukraine and Russia are also locked in fighting hundreds of miles to the southwest, in the Kherson region, where Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of the capital city but the Kremlin still controls a large swath of territory. A Russian artillery strike damaged a kindergarten, infrastructure and an emergency medical aid station on Tuesday in Kherson, although no casualties were reported, the regional governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said on Telegram.', 'Since he took overall command of Russia’s war effort in October, Gen. Sergei Surovikin has sought to rally Russian forces from their series of defeats this fall. He pulled Russian troops out of the city of Kherson in an organized retreat, and has made efforts to conserve Russia’s artillery supplies and reconstitute units, analysts say.', 'After losing the city of Kherson and suffering other setbacks in the region, Russia has been regrouping and reinforcing its troops in northern Luhansk for an offensive that would aim to extend its control in the region, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group.', 'To that end, the institute said, Russia is prioritizing mobilizing troops to defend Kreminna and Svatove over operations in other parts of eastern Ukraine. The institute cited Ukrainian military reports of increased Russian movements of troops, military equipment and ammunition in the area.', 'It said, however, that Russian success in the short term appeared unlikely given the difficult terrain and the “very limited” offensive capabilities of Moscow’s forces after months of heavy losses. Though a draft in the fall provided Russia with hundreds of thousands of sorely needed troops, artillery-heavy warfare has depleted its best-trained units and strained its supplies.', 'Ukraine also faces serious supply problems, analysts say, especially as its Western supporters themselves start to run through their stockpiles.', '“Ukrainian artillery use, conservatively, is probably around maybe 90,000 rounds per month,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a Virginia research institute, said last week on the “War on the Rocks” podcast. “That’s a lot more than anybody makes in the West right now. So all of this has been coming out of stocks, which is like going through your saving accounts.”', 'He added that Ukrainian leaders were “willing to say what it takes to get the assistance they need” for beating Russian forces back. “I don’t blame them. Their war effort hinges on external material support, that’s basically it.”']"

As a boy he had stood in awe of the High Gothic cathedral, its massive rose window, its imposing gallery of kings. Now Bataille was 21, discharged from a brief stint in the French Army, and trying to recognize a cathedral whose roof was gone and whose nave was choked with debris.', 'Reims Cathedral stood hard by the Western Front, and amid the fathomless violence of World War I, beyond the trenches and away from the gas, the repeated shelling of the cathedral became one of the elemental symbols of its barbarity. French newspapers invoked Reims as proof of German inhumanity. German propaganda blamed France for bringing the destruction on itself.', 'In recent years I’ve thought too often of Reims’s admonition — a centuries-old monument exploded in minutes, the present betraying the past — when looking at the new cultural ruins of this century. In Afghanistan and Iraq. In Syria, in Armenia, in Ethiopia. Now, up close, in Ukraine.', '“Corpses themselves did not mirror death more than did a shattered church,” the young Bataille first thought after seeing the ruins of Reims Cathedral. He might as well have been writing about the Monastery of the Caves, which has stood for centuries in the eastern Ukrainian town of Sviatohirsk — which endured airstrikes, shelling and sniper fire this spring, leaving marble statues shattered and wooden spires burned to the nails.', 'Yet after that first shock, amid the rubble of a century ago, Bataille made an observation about violence and culture that applies as much to Sviatohirsk as to Reims: that rubble can serve as the soil of cultural rebirth. Faith and doubt went together for him, and even the greatest abandonment had a fecundity that defied war. “One should not seek among her stones something belonging to the past and to death,” Bataille came to believe. “In her awful silence flickers a light that transfigures her vision: That light is hope.”', 'Every army attacks people. A few attack time as well. Over the past six months, with my extraordinary and dogged colleagues from The New York Times’s Visual Investigations team, I’ve been absorbed in the toll of cultural destruction brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We identified 339 buildings, monuments and other cultural sites that the war has partially or totally destroyed. We paid closest attention to four in the Donbas: the industrial, largely Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine where a war has been ongoing since 2014. The Sviatohirsk monastery is the most famous and beautiful of them, but we also investigated a Soviet-era cultural center, a bilingual community library and a contemporary military commemoration, all now lost.', '“They aim at the most important things: museums, libraries, the things on which we build our authenticity,” said Svitlana Moiseeva, a librarian we spoke to who had fled west from the Donbas.', 'Some of the cultural sites we documented were destroyed with intent — above all Ukrainian monuments, which have been smashed or dismantled on camera in several Russian-occupied regions. (Targeting cultural sites for destruction is a war crime, per the 1954 Hague Convention of the United Nations, to which both Russia and Ukraine are parties.) Others appeared to be collateral damage. Most of Ukraine’s ravaged cultural sites are like the shelled Reims Cathedral: perhaps not directly targeted, but destroyed with ruthless unconcern.', 'Over the summer, I’d traveled to liberated towns outside Kyiv. I walked through the wreckage of the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, which burned down to the studs, and the house of culture in Borodianka, whose tattered theater had once hosted a thriving local arts program. The destruction is even more intense in the east of the country. Working with colleagues to document its scale, watching loop after loop of burning churches and battered archives, one matter became clear: The damage to arts and heritage was the inevitable product of a Russian invasion meant to extinguish a national culture.', 'President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is prosecuting this war to inscribe Ukraine into a “Russian world.” He makes no secret of this. “We are one people,” Mr. Putin wrote in his notorious 2021 essay that negated Ukrainian nationhood and cast Ukrainian art and literature as Russian patrimony. This June, at an exhibition in Moscow, the Russian president explicitly analogized his war to the 18th-century imperial conquests of Peter the Great. Just this past Sunday, in a Russian television interview, he accused foreign adversaries of “aiming to tear apart Russia, the historical Russia.” The point of invading Ukraine, Mr. Putin reiterated, was “to unite the Russian people.”', 'Language, religion, historical memory: These, as much as territory, are the war’s contemporary battlefields. Against its appalling human cost, its cultural toll may feel insignificant, or luxurious — but culture is in every way a front of this imperial war, and the fate of more nations than one hangs on its defense.', 'What sort of culture can blossom out of charred ground? Some will have a nationalist, even propagandistic tenor, which is no sin amid a war of aggression. (By the time I got to the house of culture in Irpin in July, the musical group Kalush Orchestra had already filmed its video for “Stefania” — which was this year’s Eurovision Song Contest winner and has become an unofficial war anthem — in the crushed remains of its music hall.)', 'Ukraine, though, already has an incredible generation of artists, writers, filmmakers and musicians who came of age after the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Maidan revolution: writers like Serhiy Zhadan and Yevgenia Belorusets, artists like Mykola Ridnyi and Anna Scherbyna, who were already forging a new, postcolonial Ukrainian culture from the Donbas’s postindustrial landscape. They are in the vanguard of what we must hope, when this war ends, will be a new cultural settlement that succeeds the imperial violence of the past.', 'More than Bataille, this coming Ukrainian generation has kept me in mind of another author of humanity in extremes who lived in northern France after a global conflagration. Samuel Beckett, after spending World War II aiding the French Resistance, went to work in a ruined town in Normandy in 1945: a town called Saint-Lô, whose parish church, like Reims Cathedral before it, had crumbled beneath the bombs.', 'Beckett served there as a storekeeper and interpreter at a provisional hospital set up by the Irish Red Cross — and yet, as Beckett wrote in the wreckage, “‘Provisional’ is not the term it was, in this universe become provisional.”', 'It was in that martyr city, among hollowed houses and numberless casualties, where Beckett’s subtractive vision began to crystallize into a new art of bleak hope. Civilization seemed abandoned. Humanity appeared futureless. Yet somehow, in a wiped-out corner of Normandy, horror and sympathy fused into the existentialism of “Waiting for Godot” and, later, culminated in the black optimism of “Happy Days.”', 'In our century too — forgive my romanticism, but I really do believe it — there will be a new generation, Ukrainian and not only, to reinitiate our culture in the rubble of war. They will discover in the martyred city of Mariupol what Beckett discovered in Saint-Lô: “a time-honored conception of humanity in ruins, and perhaps even an inkling of the terms in which our condition is to be thought again.”']"

Some are now buried in the local cemetery, but there is no surge of outrage against Russian leaders.","['Even under a thick coating of snow, the graveyard for Russian soldiers killed in the Ukraine war is awash in color. Graves are heaped with wreaths of plastic flowers and, at each mound, flags representing the dead soldier’s unit whip in the wind.', 'On a recent Saturday, a woman named Natalia grasped a brush and carefully swept clumps of sticky fresh snow off her son’s wreaths. She removed the red carnations she had brought the week before, now frozen, replacing them with a small Christmas tree she purchased at the cemetery entrance.', 'Natalia comes at least once a week to care for the grave of her only son, who was killed in the first days of the war, after his group of soldiers swept into Ukraine and tried and failed to secure the Hostomel airfield, near Kyiv. What was left of his body arrived in Ryazan several weeks later.', '“Even when I’m sick, I come here, because I worry he’s going to be bored,” she said of her son, whose remains arrived just shy of his 26th birthday. She declined to provide her surname, fearing retribution for speaking out.', 'Many Western opponents of Russia’s war in Ukraine expected that mothers like Natalia would become the backbone of a surge of outrage against President Vladimir V. Putin, and evolve into a political force opposing him. But 10 months into the conflict, that has not happened on a large scale — and certainly not in Ryazan, a city of half a million people known for its elite paratrooper unit.', 'Natalia said that she thought the invasion “should have been planned better,” in order to minimize losses, but she expressed no anger at Russia’s leadership. “Something had to be done,” she said, referring to Ukraine.', 'That kind of continued support has been a crucial factor in Mr. Putin’s ability to avoid any significant domestic blowback to his war, allowing him to double down on his commitment to pursuing his goals in Ukraine despite a series of setbacks.', 'Natalia was alone in the cemetery on her recent visit, but if the number of soldiers buried there is any indication, there are many more mourning mothers like her. There were at least 20 rows with three fresh graves each.', 'Still, by many accounts, Ryazan, home to two military bases, sends its men off to war with pride, even though some return in body bags.', 'The city, about 100 miles southeast of Moscow, is particularly proud of its paratroopers. A gargantuan sculpture of their logo along the main road celebrates the city as the “home of the VDV,” the initials of an elite paratrooper unit of which Natalia’s son was a member. In the city center is a sprawling school for the unit’s cadets, with a museum next door celebrating its history.', 'A long hallway documents its participation in various military campaigns and already includes artifacts from this war.', 'A 20-minute drive from the cemetery into the city center, Marina N. Doronina also expressed support for the war. Her 27-year-old son Vadim was called up just a few days after Mr. Putin announced in late September that Russia would mobilize several hundred thousand men.', 'The single mother of two other children, including one with severe disabilities, Ms. Doronina, a home health aide, depends on her eldest son for financial help and physical labor. Her roof is “leaking like a sieve” and he had planned to fix it before the winter set in.', '“Who will fix my roof now?” she asked. “He was also going to fix my fence in the autumn.”', 'But she said she was not angry that he was sent to war. Nor did she oppose mobilization in general. Instead, she said, she was angry at the “system,” which couldn’t provide a delay, if not an exception, for her son.', 'She communicates with Vadim in Ukraine over the WhatsApp chatting platform. He sends videos of himself in trenches spending time with fellow soldiers. She feels proud when she sees photos of him dressed in camouflage, she said.', '“This situation must be resolved somehow,” she said, echoing Natalia’s vague assertion about Ukraine. But even as she was annoyed about the way the local authorities managed the mobilization of her son, she expressed faith in Mr. Putin.', '“Our president is quite wise, and he is still doing a good job,” she said.', 'Repeating a common theme pushed by propaganda programs on state TV and among many ordinary people, she said she believed “the West” was not only fighting in Ukraine, but also suffering the consequences of the war worse than Russia was.', '“People don’t have anything there,” she said of the West. “Go to our stores, we have everything. This doesn’t affect us in any way,” she said, though she acknowledged that prices had risen slightly.', 'A significant number of Russians appear to agree. Though many fear speaking publicly about the war and often parrot the Kremlin’s narrative, a survey this month by the Levada Center, an independent pollster, showed that more than 70 percent either “definitely” or “mostly” support the activities of the Russian Army, while 64 percent believe the country is going in the right direction.', '“All this will be settled and soon everything will be normal,” she added.', 'Yet something quite out of the ordinary has already happened in Ryazan, which is only 300 miles from the border with Ukraine. Its two military installations have made the city the target of one of the deepest Ukrainian military strikes inside Russian territory since the war began.', 'On Dec. 5, two Soviet-made drones fell on bases in Ryazan and near the city of Saratov, farther east. In Ryazan, the drone was aimed at the Dyagilevo Air Base, a training center for strategic bomber forces. Russia said it intercepted the drone and shot it down, a claim that could not be confirmed, but acknowledged that three people were killed and five injured in the attack, which also damaged a supersonic Tupolev Tu-22M strike bomber.', 'The Russian Ministry of Defense blamed Ukraine. Ukraine does not publicly acknowledge strikes inside Russia, intentionally maintaining ambiguity.', 'It was a rare instance of Ukraine striking far inside Russian territory. Not far from the base, some residents tried to appear casual about the drone attack.', 'At the main transport hub in the Dyagilevo neighborhood — a slushy bus stop across from a park where children played on top of a statue of a Tupolev Tu-16 bomber — a 70-year-old woman named Valentina Petrovna insisted that there was “nothing to be afraid of.”', 'Had anything changed in her life this past year, which brought seismic changes to Russia and the world? “Nothing,” she insisted, even though she said she had many relatives in the military. “We are waiting for our boys to win as soon as possible.”', 'However, Alina, a 19-year-old medical student, admitted feeling some fear. She had been standing at the bus stop on Dec. 5 when she heard the explosion.', '“Everything was shaking,” she said, and fear that it could happen again was affecting her holiday mood.', 'The drone incident has made locals start paying more attention to the war, according to Aleksandr Yurov, an internet technology specialist. “People finally started to be concerned,” Mr. Yurov, 34, who is against the war, said.', 'There is reason to think it can happen again: On Monday, Moscow said it had shot down another Ukrainian drone over the Engels base, near Saratov, and that three personnel were killed.', 'But by and large, Mr. Yurov said, many people he knew had started calling for more attacks on Ukraine or more extreme measures against the West, something that dismayed him.', 'He said he had been briefly detained twice, once on Feb. 24, the day the war started, after the police caught him holding an antiwar poster, and again on Sep. 21, the day Mr. Putin announced mobilization, when he was outside a stationery store preparing to buy a poster.', '“Here, supporting human rights is considered extremism,” Mr. Yurov said. He was keen to talk to foreign reporters because he said it was the only way to express his beliefs in contemporary Russia.', 'He spends his spare time trying to help Ukrainian refugees who have settled in the Ryazan region.', 'Some 200 Ukrainian families have settled in Ryazan, according to Yelena N. Samsonkina, who runs a charity that collects clothes and products for the refugee families — and for the Russian troops who have played a role in the their displacement.', '“People have become more united here,” in support of the war effort, Ms. Samsonkina said in the headquarters of her organization.', '“Grandmothers are knitting socks and children are writing letters in school” for the troops, she said.', 'She rebuffed a question about whether the military was poorly equipped, given that volunteers needed to collect thermoses or other essential items for Russian soldiers. The army had everything it needed, she said, but volunteers could procure some items faster than the military bureaucracy.', 'Ms. Samsonkina said that her son might be mobilized, something that worried her daughter. But he was ready to fight, she said, and she herself would not object if he were called up.', '“I’m happy to have a son like that,” she said. “How else could I feel about it? Of course, I’m nervous, I’m very worried. But I’m not going to talk him out of it.”', 'She said she was completely behind the war.', '“Putin took the first step,” she said. “If he hadn’t done it, who knows where we would be now?”']"

The Russian military is already fighting at the limits of its conventional capabilities, Ukrainians say, and the Kremlin’s hints of using nuclear weapons ring hollow.', 'The Russian military, in a statement cited by the state-run TASS news agency, said that it had shot down a Ukrainian drone on Monday as it approached the Engels air base, about 300 miles from the Ukrainian border. It said that the falling wreckage had caused the casualties and that no aircraft had been damaged, assertions that could not be confirmed. Engels, home to some of Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers that are used to fire cruise missiles at Ukraine, was one of two air bases targeted by Ukrainian drones on Dec. 5.', 'In the months after Russia invaded on Feb. 24, Ukraine’s allies voiced concern about attacks on Russian soil and the risk of retaliatory escalation, which the Kremlin and state-controlled media have threatened repeatedly. The United States and others still refuse to supply Ukraine with long-range weapons, and insist that the weapons they provide not be used to fire into Russia, but the fear of escalation has abated.', '“There were many, many red lines stated by Russia regarding further escalation,” Serhiy Hrabskiy, a retired colonel and commentator on the war for Ukrainian news media, said in an interview. Despite warnings of dire consequences, “there is no reaction,” Mr. Hrabskiy said. “Why? Because the Russians simply do not have capacity to do so.”', 'Ukraine has struck repeatedly at military targets in Crimea and other Russian-occupied territory that Moscow now claims as its own, and at infrastructure like the Kerch Strait bridge linking Crimea to Russia. And now it is stepping up attacks into Russia itself.', 'Ukraine maintains a policy of not publicly claiming or denying responsibility for attacks in Russia, even as officials comment approvingly on them. Col. Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said on television that the latest attack was “a consequence of what Russia is doing” in Ukraine.', 'The Ukrainian attacks have been pinpricks compared to the widespread devastation Russia has wrought against Ukraine. But the strikes have boosted Ukrainian morale, damaged some Russian warplanes and infrastructure, and pierced the air of normalcy the Kremlin has tried to maintain for most of its people.', '“If the Russians thought that no one at home would be affected by the war, then they were deeply mistaken,” Colonel Ihnat said. He added that explosions at Russian airfields complicated the bombing campaign against Ukraine, forcing Moscow to relocate some of its aircraft, though no one is claiming that the strikes have seriously impeded the Russian barrage.', 'The Dec. 5 attacks were carried out using a Soviet-era, jet-powered surveillance drone, modified to function as an offensive weapon, according to Russian and Ukrainian officials, shortly after a state-owned Ukrainian contractor said it had developed an attack drone with a range of over 600 miles — more than enough to reach Moscow.', 'The U.S. reaction to the Dec. 5 assaults was muted. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said, “We are not working to prevent Ukraine from developing their own capability.” Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, stated only that the United States was neither encouraging nor enabling attacks on Russia.', 'Both the State and Defense Departments declined to comment on the reported drone strike on Monday.', 'The attacks have further infuriated pro-war Russian commentators, who have railed about their country’s exposed vulnerabilities. They had already expressed anger over the Russian military’s poor combat performance. Not only have Russian air defenses failed to stop at least some of the strikes, but Ukrainian officials have also said that some were enabled by Ukrainian partisans or special forces operating behind the lines.', 'Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told The Associated Press on Monday that his government wanted to hold a “peace summit,” hopefully mediated by the United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, by late February, but that Russia could not be invited unless it first faced prosecution for war crimes. It was the latest in a string of claims by each country to be open to peace talks — but only on terms that are unacceptable to the other.', 'In the past three months, Russia has launched waves of missiles and drones at Ukraine, sending as many as 100 at a time in a bid to overwhelm air defenses. They have targeted civilian infrastructure like the electrical grid and heating plants, pitching millions of people at a time into the cold and dark amid dangerous winter weather.', 'Russian officials who originally denied such strikes have since insisted that the targets had military value, and have cast the attacks as retaliatory. President Vladimir V. Putin has cited the Kerch bridge bombing as the motive, though the concentrated strikes on Ukraine’s power grid began earlier.', 'Ukraine and its allies have dismissed that as nonsense, noting that Russia has not hesitated to kill, wound or terrorize civilians since it began its invasion, and would be doing so no matter how Ukraine responded. The concentrated infrastructure attacks, they say, are a reaction to the battlefield setbacks of the Russian military — an illegal attempt to force Kyiv to capitulate by imposing maximum suffering on civilians.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who received a hero’s welcome in Washington last week, warned in his nightly video address late Sunday that Russia could intensify its barrage to cause blackouts for much of the country before the New Year’s Eve holiday.', '“We must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for us,” he said.', 'Military analysts say that Russia may be running low on the cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles it has used against Ukraine. In an interview published on Monday, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s director of military intelligence, told Liga.net, a Ukrainian news outlet, that the Kremlin had enough for only two or three more big waves of attacks.', '“They will run out,” Mr. Budanov said.', 'Russia has increasingly resorted to using Iranian-bought drones, which are much cheaper than missiles, but they are also much slower and easier to shoot down and carry less powerful warheads. Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that Russia could also buy Iranian ballistic missiles, extending the life of its bombing campaign.', 'The most sophisticated missile in Russia’s arsenal is the Kinzhal, which Mr. Putin has boasted of as a new superweapon and has used a few times against Ukraine. Like a cruise missile or drone, it can maneuver evasively in flight, and like a ballistic missile, it is hypersonic, traveling many times the speed of sound. President Biden has described it as “almost impossible to stop.”', 'But Russia began its invasion with 47 Kinzhals in its arsenal, Mr. Budanov said, and has manufactured only “a few” more during the war.', '“You can scare the world with the fact that you have a Kinzhal,” he said. “But when you start to really use them, what’s next?”']"

The 2007 study, written by the Swedish Defense Research Agency, even posited a scenario:', '“One diver would be enough to set an explosive device.”', 'Today, European investigators face almost exactly that scenario. The Swedish authorities leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor was most likely responsible for a September blast that ripped through the gas pipes. Officials and experts say that explosives were probably dropped from ships or — just as the Swedish report warned — planted on the seafloor using submarines or divers.', 'The Nord Stream attack has been a wartime mystery, prompting finger-pointing and speculation about how — in an era of constant satellite surveillance, in the midst of an energy crisis and with Europe on alert because of the war in Ukraine — a vessel could creep up on a crucial energy conduit, plant a bomb and leave without a trace.', 'The Baltic Sea, it turns out, was a nearly ideal crime scene. Its floor is latticed with telecommunication cables and pipes that, as had been warned, are not closely monitored. Ships come and go constantly from the nine countries bordering the sea, and vessels can easily hide by turning off their tracking transponders.', '“The key question is not what kind of surveillance there was, but why the lack of surveillance for this pipeline — and other pipelines and electric cables and the underwater cables on the seabed,” said Niklas Rossbach, deputy research director at the Swedish Defense Research Agency.', 'The Baltic is also a giant graveyard for unexploded munitions and chemical weapons dumped after the World Wars. Expeditions to clear those obstacles are common, meaning the expertise to carry out underwater detonation is ubiquitous. Several countries along the Baltic, including Russia, have dive teams that specialize in seabed operations, officials in the region said. Russia, with a port along the Baltic, has small, quiet submarines that can move undetected, according to former military and intelligence officials in the region.', 'After the blasts, Poland and Ukraine openly blamed Russia but provided no evidence. In an interview, Daniel Stenling, Sweden’s top counterintelligence official, declined to speculate on a perpetrator. But he placed the Nord Stream attack squarely in the context of increasingly brazen Russian espionage.', '“In the big context of the war in Ukraine that is ongoing, it’s very interesting and very serious,” he said of the blasts, repeatedly emphasizing growing threats from Russian spycraft and cyberattacks.', '“We have seen increased acts from Russia for a long time now,” he said.', 'Russia, for its part, has blamed Britain, also without evidence.', 'Russia has a history of using energy to exert influence and has an interest in fracturing alliances within Europe. But the theory that Russia carried out the blasts, repeated often by Western officials, has only gotten more complicated.', 'In recent weeks, Nord Stream AG, which is majority-owned by a Kremlin-controlled company, has begun pricing out the cost to repair the pipe and restore gas flow, according to a person briefed on the work who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it publicly. One repair estimate starts at about $500 million, the person said. Consultants for Russia are also studying how long the damaged pipes can withstand saltwater exposure. The inquiries raise the question of why, if Russia bombed its own pipelines, it would begin the expensive work of repairing them.', 'But like any good mystery story, the sabotage has layers of intrigue and multiple players with degrees of motive and ability. Even the decision by the Swedish government to keep details of its inquiry secret from Western allies has prompted whispered speculation that perhaps investigators have cracked the case and are strategically keeping quiet.', 'Not so, Mr. Stenling said. “We have no concrete evidence,” he said. “But hopefully we will.”', 'As for his government’s choice to keep its cards close, Mr. Stenling said: “The entire investigation is unusual.”', 'Nord Stream encompasses two projects, each a pair of concrete-encased steel pipes nearly four feet in diameter and more than 700 miles long.', 'The first pair, Nord Stream I, came online in 2011. Germany wanted cheap, reliable gas, and Russia wanted to reduce its reliance on piping gas through Ukraine, a country with which it had a contentious relationship long before this year’s invasion.', 'Just about everyone else in Europe, along with the United States, objected. A senior Polish official even compared the pipeline deal to the pre-World War II pact between Hitler and Stalin that carved up Poland.', 'Sweden objected to part of the project that was planned near its coastline, arguing that it could enable Russian surveillance.', 'But the biggest argument was that Nord Stream would make Europe too reliant on Russian gas, giving Moscow a lever over the European Union with its ability to turn off supplies.', 'Soon after Nord Stream I went online, the Kremlin started pushing for another set of pipes. This second pipeline, known as Nord Stream II, has been even more contentious, with most of the European Union and the United States — under both President Barack Obama and President Donald J. Trump — opposing it.', 'Construction finished last September and, as Russian soldiers gathered on the border with Ukraine, Ukrainian officials saw the pipeline as a security threat. If Russian gas suppliers could further bypass Ukraine, the argument went, the Kremlin would have no reason not to bomb Ukrainian infrastructure.', 'Last year, Ukrainian energy regulators sent a 13-page letter to Poland as part of a coordinated effort to stop the new pipeline from coming online. Nord Stream II “will negatively impact on Ukraine’s national security,” read the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. The letter also warned of economic consequences for Ukraine, since Russian companies still pay to send gas through Ukrainian pipes.', 'Even after Russia invaded, a Ukrainian government document obtained by The Times shows that Ukraine expected to continue charging Russian companies, including state-owned Gazprom and Rosneft, to transmit gas during the first half of 2022. Under its contract, Ukraine receives an average of $1 billion a year in transit fees.', 'So the pipelines had no shortage of adversaries.', 'But sabotaging a key piece of energy infrastructure could be considered an act of war. For a European Union or NATO member to carry it out would have significant consequences, shattering trust in two of the most important Western partnerships. And while attacking the pipeline may have made financial sense for Ukraine, particularly in a time of war, its capability to pull off such a feat is unclear. Ukraine does not have a Baltic port and its only known submarine was captured by Russia in 2014.', 'Many European governments and experts see Moscow as the most likely saboteur. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has used gas as a political lever in the past and there is evidence that he saw Europe as vulnerable.', 'In one Gazprom meeting, an executive dismissed the idea that Europe could leave Nord Stream II closed. “Wait for one cold winter, and they will beg for our gas,” one official told colleagues at a meeting with Russian policymakers and business executives last year, according to an attendee. The attendee spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the meeting.', 'But Germany blocked Nord Stream II’s launch.', 'As European countries stockpiled natural gas this year, the Kremlin’s behavior changed. Russia took Nord Stream I offline in late August, blaming mechanical issues. In early September, the Kremlin said that the pipeline would be shut indefinitely. The explosions came a few weeks later, on Sept. 26. They severed both strands of Nord Stream I and one of the Nord Stream II pipes.', 'The explosion does not neatly benefit Russia. It must keep paying transit fees to Ukraine, it cannot easily use the promise of cheap gas to cleave Germany from its European allies, and it faces hefty repair costs.', 'But the sabotage all but guarantees that gas prices will be uncomfortably high for Europeans until spring. And it creates an incentive for E.U. countries to push Ukraine to negotiate a quick ending, since the war threatens the land-based pipes that bring gas west. The fact that one of the Nord Stream II pipes remains intact also means that, in an energy crunch, Germany could reverse course and allow that pipe to start pumping gas.', 'Sabotaging Nord Stream also creates uncertainty about what other infrastructure could be attacked. In addition to damaging the pipeline, the explosion came perilously close to damaging a cable carrying electricity from Sweden to Poland. “You are sending a signal,” said Martin Kragh, deputy director of the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies at the nonprofit Swedish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s signaling ‘We can do this, and we can do this elsewhere.’”', 'The fact that the pipeline was not carrying gas at the time of the explosions has contributed to that speculation.', '“We are less certain that the primary aim was functional damage here, because the Nord Stream gas pipeline was not operational at the time,” said Kjell Engelbrekt, who teaches political science at the Swedish Defense University.', '(The lack of gas at the time of the explosion also casts serious doubt on a theory that a bomb was sent through the pipe using an inspection device known as a PIG, or pipeline inspection gauge. “Nonsense,” said Stephan Harmsen, who designed the PIG for Nord Stream I. Those devices require gas flow to operate, he said).', 'Swedish investigators have recovered explosive residue from the blast site. But they have found the Baltic a difficult environment. Undersea photos showed little. Surveillance of such an enormous pipeline would have been incredibly expensive and was never a priority for European intelligence agencies. The best undersea surveillance in the area, security experts say, is by Russian sonar sensors along the pipeline. Western investigators have no access to that data.', 'With scant evidence from the seabed, a breakthrough may rely on intelligence service wiretaps and human sources. But so far, American and European intelligence agencies have not publicly shared any data that they might have collected.', '“It’s very fascinating, but it’s very complex,” Mr. Engelbrekt said. “And it’s very difficult without access to some of these data points to start eliminating actors and motives.”']"

Putin of Russia by name.', 'Francis now regularly speaks out against war, but it has taken him a long and fitful time to find his voice.', 'Driven by hopes of maintaining the Vatican’s traditional aversion to picking sides in conflict to potentially play a role in an eventual brokering of peace, as well as by an entrenched anti-NATO bias in some corners of the Vatican, Francis has studiously avoided naming Mr. Putin, or even Russia itself, as the aggressor. Only at the end of August, amid questioning about whether the pope was risking his moral authority, did the Vatican issue a statement saying “the large-scale war in Ukraine” was “initiated by the Russian Federation.” It insisted Francis’ condemnation was “unequivocal.”', 'Earlier that month, he had infuriated Ukrainians by calling Daria Dugina, a 29-year-old Russian ultranationalist who spoke out in favor of the invasion of Ukraine, an “innocent” victim after she was killed in a car bombing. In September, Francis, who incessantly criticizes the arms trade, said it was acceptable for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine so that the country could defend itself. Self-defense in the face of aggression, Francis said at the time, was “not only lawful, but also an expression of love of country.”', 'More recently, he has spoken about the “battered Ukrainian people,” but then, in a November interview with the Jesuit magazine America, he said he had received “much information about the cruelty of the troops” in the war in Ukraine.', 'But despite ample public information and investigations into the behavior of the Russian troops, including mass killings, Francis added, “As a rule, the most cruel, perhaps, are those who are from Russia but do not adhere to the Russian tradition, such as Chechens, Buryats and so on.” Many Chechens are Muslim. Buryats are a Mongol ethnic group who traditionally follow Buddhist and shamanic beliefs.', 'Besides prompting perplexity in the West, Francis’ remarks infuriated Russia, which demanded an apology from the Vatican. Its diplomats reached out to Moscow and apparently apologized.', 'This month, Francis appealed to the faithful to spend less money on their Christmas gifts and parties and to send the saved money to Ukrainians struggling through the frigid winter.', 'And in remarks ushering in the holiday at a Christmas Eve Mass before thousands of faithful packed in St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis lamented the consumerism that risked emptying the holiday of its meaning, and blamed the sins of greed and the thirsts for power for causing some leaders to want to “consume even their neighbors.”', 'To avoid standing for too long on Saturday, Francis delegated much of the celebrating of the ceremony to a cardinal. On Christmas Day, he stood with the help of a cane from the basilica balcony overlooking the square.', 'Moving beyond Ukraine on Sunday, he touched on other “theaters of this third world war” around the globe.', '“Let us think of Syria, still scarred by a conflict that has receded into the background but has not ended,” he said. He mentioned the suffering of the people of Haiti and the increasing violence in the Holy Land, and he urged a divine intervention to rebuild “mutual trust between Israelis and Palestinians.” He urged an end to the conflict and violence tearing apart the coexistence of people with different cultures and traditions in northern Africa, prayed for a lasting truce in Yemen and for reconciliation in Myanmar and Iran.', 'Francis also noted how the war in Ukraine had aggravated the risk of famine around the world, especially in Afghanistan and the countries of the Horn of Africa, and he argued that money that could go to feeding the hungry went to arming soldiers.', '“We know that every war causes hunger and exploits food as a weapon, hindering its distribution to people already suffering,” he said, urging political leaders to commit “to making food solely an instrument of peace.” But he did not say which leader he was referring to.', 'Francis also emphasized past hallmarks of his papacy, including care for migrants and the destitute, calling the world “sick with indifference” and unwelcoming to Jesus as it is to “many foreigners” and the poor.', '“Today, may we not forget the many displaced persons and refugees who knock at our door in search of some comfort, warmth and food,” he said. “Let us not forget the marginalized, those living alone, the orphans and the elderly who risk being set aside.”']"

Now that Vladimir V. Putin’s forces are gone, people feel free to talk — and to brag a little.","['On a foggy morning a few months ago, Valentyn Dmytrovych Yermolenko, an aging Ukrainian fisherman with a bad back and horrible knees, puttered down a narrow channel off the Dnipro River, his inflatable dinghy cutting through the mist.', 'His city, Kherson, had been taken over by the Russian Army, and on the floor of his boat, concealed under a fishing net in a black plastic tub, Mr. Yermolenko had hidden three disassembled automatic rifles.', 'As he took a bend in the river, he recalled, a Russian patrol boat materialized in front of him. A commander standing on the deck in crisp camouflage barked: “Grandpa! Where are you going?”', 'After Mr. Yermolenko muttered something about getting fish for his wife, the commander ordered a search of the boat. A young soldier stomped aboard and went straight to the black plastic tub.', '“What is this?” he asked.', 'Mr. Yermolenko, 64, said he was so scared that he wet his pants.', 'Kherson, at the mouth of the Dnipro, near the Black Sea, was captured in the war’s first days. Russian officials soon declared it part of Russia forever.', 'Kherson’s occupation government, run by Russian military commanders and Ukrainian collaborators, wasted little time pulling down Ukrainian flags, taking over Ukrainian schools, trucking in crates of Russian rubles, even importing Russian families. Perhaps nowhere else in Ukraine did Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, devote so much money and violence, the carrot and the stick, to bend a city to his imperial will.', 'But it did not work.', 'Guided by contacts in the Ukrainian security services, an assembly of ordinary citizens formed themselves into a grass-roots resistance movement. In dozens of interviews, residents and Ukrainian officials described how retirees like Mr. Yermolenko — along with students, mechanics, grandmothers, and even a wealthy couple who were fixing up their yacht and got trapped in the city for the better part of a year — became spirited partisans for the Kherson underground. It was like something out of a spy movie.', 'They took clandestine videos of Russian troops and sent them to Ukrainian forces along with map coordinates. They used code names and passwords to circulate guns and explosives right under the Russians’ noses. Some even formed small attack teams that picked off Russian soldiers at night, making the fear and paranoia that settled over the city two-sided.', 'When the Russian Army hastily pulled out in mid-November, perhaps the biggest embarrassment so far to Mr. Putin’s war effort, Kherson became a powerful symbol. To allies questioning Ukraine’s resolve, and to Ukrainians themselves who had suffered so much misery and death and needed a glimmer of hope, Kherson showed what was possible.', 'Now that the Russian forces are gone and people feel free to talk about what they did and even brag a little, one message keeps emerging.', '“I never questioned what we were doing,” said Dmytro Yevminov, the yacht owner whom Mr. Yermolenko recruited into hiding guns and sacks of grenades in various boatyards. “I never knew I loved my country so much.”', 'Mr. Yermolenko and his wife, Olena, might not seem like insurgent types.', 'Hovering over each other in their small kitchen, the rushing blue flame on the stove serving as the home’s only source of heat, they shoo each other away and shush each other, arguing over who is the bigger patriot.', '“I’m the one who forced you to feel like this,” she said, laughing.', '“Well,” Mr. Yermolenko sighed, “maybe this country didn’t give me everything I wanted. But it’s still my country.”', 'They met in Kherson in 1978. She was a clerk at a shipbuilding plant. He had been born in Belarus and had just exited the Soviet army.', 'He spied her sunbathing on a beach alongside the Dnipro River and soon they married, moving to a riverside Kherson neighborhood called the Island, where people make their living off the water one way or another: fishing, working at boatyards or at the shipbuilding plants, servicing marine engines. The Yermolenkos used to run a smoked-fish business but retired a few years ago. It was not long before their lives were upended.', 'On Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion, thousands of Russian troops poured into Kherson, which had a population of about 300,000 before the war. Like in many other Ukrainian cities, local residents, some with military experience, banded together into a group known as a territorial defense force to try to repel Moscow’s army. Mr. Yermolenko and his teenage grandson, also named Valentyn, enlisted.', 'They had few weapons, mostly just some old hunting rifles. Worse, the Ukrainian military made a strategic decision to withdraw from Kherson, leaving the local fighters on their own.', 'They tried to ambush a Russian column a few days after the invasion but failed miserably, according to witnesses, leaving at least 18 militia members dead on the frozen ground. After that, the Kherson resistance changed tactics. It went underground.', 'Members of the local defense force and other civilians began to spy on Russian troops in the city. The Ukrainian security services encouraged this — within days of the war breaking out, they set up special channels on Telegram and other messaging services for people to funnel strategic tips.', 'The Yermolenkos volunteered to aggregate information from their neighborhood. Since they had been living on the Island for so long, they knew everyone, and Mr. Yermolenko maintained contacts within the Ukrainian military from his connections to the territorial defense force.', 'Every day, the Yermolenkos said they received dozens of videos, audio files and texts tracking the location of Russian troops moving through their city — how many there were, what kind of vehicles they were using and their direction of travel. All this was incredibly dangerous, but countless people were willing to do it.', '“We had a grandma in a high-rise feeding us stuff,” Ms. Yermolenko, 65, said. “We had Dima and Oksana on the water in their sailboat watching the Russian river patrols. We had people everywhere.”', 'Their house, they said, became “a transmitter.”', 'The resistance movement would soon evolve. In the next few weeks, Ukrainian military commanders and intelligence agents based outside the city asked civilians whom they trusted, including the Yermolenkos, to do even more.', 'Life was getting grim. Kherson was running out of food. Stores were closed. People were out of work. Russian troops were searching for civilians who were spying on them; many residents shared disturbing stories of themselves or people they knew being dragged into torture chambers and subjected to electric shocks and sadistic beatings. ', 'But the residents kept finding avenues of resistance. In mid-April, a rash of yellow ribbons mysteriously appeared all over Kherson, spray painted on buildings. It was a small act of defiance. But residents said that Russian soldiers were so enraged that they had stormed into hardware stores and demanded to see closed-circuit TV footage to find out who had been buying yellow paint.', 'As the weeks ticked away, Mr. Yermolenko became more careful in whom he confided, he said. Slowly, he struck up a friendship with Mr. Yevminov, a successful entrepreneur whose around-the-world sailboat trip went by the wayside. The two men huddled by the waterfront, pretending that they were staring at circles from fish jumps or talking about boats, and spied on Russian patrols prowling the river.', 'One day, Mr. Yermolenko, who tends not to express a lot of emotion, pulled Mr. Yevminov aside and said, “Will you feed my dogs if something happens to me?”', 'Mr. Yermolenko felt himself getting sucked into a more dangerous role. He said that he had started receiving coded messages from contacts within the resistance network about weapons. The messages were fragmentary — a code name, a location, a password. His job was to move assault rifles, bullets and grenades from one location to another.', 'Mr. Yermolenko, along with other members of Kherson’s partisan network and a Ukrainian military officer from the city, said in interviews that the weapons had passed from civilian to civilian. Eventually, they were handed over to undercover Ukrainian security agents who had filtered quietly back into Kherson or to members of the underground territorial defense force.', '“The system was built like links in a chain,” said Oleksandr Samoylenko, head of Kherson’s regional council, who helped coordinate partisan activity from outside the city. “No person knew the next link, so if someone got caught, it wouldn’t compromise the whole operation.”', 'The Yermolenkos’ grandson, 18 at the time, was itching to get involved. He joined a cell with three other young men that stalked Russian soldiers at night. The Russian troops were sloppy, he said, often walking around the waterfront in the dark while checking their phones, oblivious to the glow they were casting.', 'He said that his team had killed at least 10 Russians; his claim could not be independently verified, but interviews with other members of the local defense force supported his account that he had killed enemy soldiers.', '“In the beginning,” he admitted, “we were terrified.” One friend, he said, swallowed a glass of vodka before every attack.', 'But soon enough, Valentyn said, they became steeled to shooting Russian soldiers at close range and plucking weapons off their still warm bodies.', 'By summer, Mr. Yermolenko was watching his city get Russified. Propaganda billboards on Kherson’s busiest boulevards were decorated with bands of white, blue and red, in the spirit of the Russian flag, which many locals derisively called “the Aquafresh.”', 'Acts of defiance kept popping up. When the occupation government severed trade links with Ukraine and then instructed transportation companies in Kherson to haul stolen Ukrainian grain to Russia, some refused, which was no small risk.', '“They assaulted our country,” said Roman Denysenko, the owner of a trucking company who was later kidnapped. “I wasn’t going to work with them. Period.”', 'Russian families began to move into apartments vacated by fleeing Ukrainians. Russian children, who residents said were the children of intelligence agents, became a common sight in Kherson’s parks and supermarkets. But Moscow’s hold on Kherson was getting shakier.', 'Mr. Samoylenko, the Kherson regional council head, said that civilians working with the army had sent in real-time surveillance information that enabled Ukrainian forces to bomb a meeting of high-level collaborators in mid-September and a hotel full of Russian intelligence officers a few weeks later. He cited two factors behind those successes: American precision artillery and partisan intelligence.', '“It’s only because of the residents that the liberation happened so quickly,” he said.', 'Flush with new, more powerful weapons, the Ukrainian military ratcheted up the pressure. They blew up bridges across the Dnipro River. Ground forces advanced across the countryside and pressed in on three sides. By early November, the Russian forces had begun to flee.', '“We didn’t know what was happening out there,” Mr. Yermolenko said.', 'But on Nov. 11, a repairman banged on his gate and joyously announced that Ukrainian forces had arrived. Mr. and Ms. Yermolenko drove to Kherson’s main square, joining the crowds of stunned, happy people celebrating the city’s liberation.', '“You wouldn’t believe what I did for the first time in my life,” he said. “I kissed a policeman.”', 'The Yermolenkos felt that it was important to recognize everyone in the neighborhood who had participated in the resistance. So, on a recent morning, two dozen partisans, men and women from their early 20s to mid 70s, wrapped in heavy coats and woolen hats, stood in their yard. The wind lifted off the river and whipped their ruddy faces.', 'Mr. Yermolenko began speaking. Many of the people here, he said, experienced close calls. He knew something about that from his encounter on the river in May.', 'When the Russian patrol stopped him that day, the soldier cracked open the plastic tub, coming within three inches of finding the concealed guns. But he apparently didn’t want to get his hands dirty and never lifted the fishing net. Had the soldier found the guns underneath, Mr. Yermolenko says he would have been shot on the spot.', 'His eyes traced the faces of the people listening to him — his neighbors, other veteran fishermen, the yacht owners. He is often gruff, even grouchy, but on this morning, he was reflective. He thanked everyone by name and at the end added, “I also want to thank everyone on the Island who didn’t betray us.”', 'He hobbled inside. No refreshments were offered. Slowly, the people walked out of his gate, into the road and back to their ordinary lives.']"

Military analysts say the infrastructure-targeting campaign is intended to demoralize Ukrainians and push their government into a cease-fire that might allow Russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensives.', 'Since October, Russia has fired volleys of missiles and drones at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in intervals of roughly a week to 10 days, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence chief. Most barrages have included around 75 missiles.', 'That tempo is likely set based on Russia’s weapons supply, Britain’s defense intelligence agency said on Saturday.', '“Russia has likely limited its long-range missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure to around once a week due to the limited availability of cruise missiles,” the agency said in its daily update. “Similarly, Russia is unlikely to have increased its stockpile of artillery munitions enough to enable large-scale offensive operations.”', 'For weeks, Ukrainian officials have expressed concern that Russian forces could use neighboring Belarus as a launchpad for a new ground offensive, with Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, a potential target.

And What Will They Do For Ukraine?,The United States is giving satellite-guided bombs to Kyiv for the first time as part of a new $1.85 billion military aid package.,"['An American weapon first dropped by stealth bombers over Kosovo in 1999 and then during combat in the post-9/11 wars will soon be used by Ukrainian pilots flying Russian-made jets to kill Russian soldiers.', 'The weapon, called the Joint Direct Attack Munition, consists of a kit that turns a cheap unguided bomb into a highly accurate, GPS-guided weapon. It is usually referred to as JDAM (pronounced JAY-dam).', 'The Biden administration announced this week that the weapons would be part of a new $1.85 billion military aid package, giving Kyiv a precision-guided bombing capability it has never had.', 'When dropped from higher altitudes, the bomb can travel about 15 miles to its target before exploding. ', 'With the right kind of equipment, Ukrainian jets could potentially carry multiple JDAMs on a single mission, just like U.S. and NATO warplanes do.', 'Technically speaking, JDAM refers to a kit that is bolted onto the U.S. military’s general purpose Mark-80-series bomb and turns it into a GPS-guided weapon.', 'The Mark-80 warhead, which was developed soon after World War II, was designed to be easily fitted with a variety of tail fins and fuzes for use in a range of situations. Over decades, different attachments have been fielded — for low-level bombing, and to turn them into land and sea mines, and finally into various types of guided weapons.', ' It typically comes in three sizes ranging from 500 to 2,000 pounds. However, which model or models will be provided to Ukraine is unclear.', 'Since their first combat use in the late 1990s, JDAMs have been improved and new capabilities have been added. They can work with a variety of fuzes that control whether they explode above the ground, on the surface or after burrowing into the ground. One updated kit adds a pair of wings that open after the bomb is dropped, allowing it to fly more than 40 miles to a target.', 'They are also relatively inexpensive, in the Pentagon’s math. A Navy fact sheet updated in 2021 put the basic JDAM kit’s average price at just over $24,000 apiece.', 'JDAM was born out of the frustration that pilots and Air Force leaders had with a different kind of guided bomb during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.', 'First used in small numbers toward the end of the Vietnam War, that bomb was called the Paveway II. At the time, the idea was considered revolutionary: An expensive kit fixed to the nose and tail of a Mark-80 could make the otherwise unguided bomb maneuverable along the path of a laser shone from the ground or from a plane above. But in Iraq, sandstorms and smoke often disrupted the path of the laser beams, causing the bomb to miss its target.', 'Months after that war ended, the Air Force decided that military pilots needed a kit that would not cost more than Paveway II and could guide bombs in all weather conditions. A new constellation of GPS satellites offered a solution, continuously beaming radio signals that could guide bombs night and day, rain or shine.', 'Air Force leaders accelerated work on a similar device to produce what ultimately became JDAMs, which are now made by Boeing at a factory in St. Charles, Mo.', 'Unlike some U.S.-provided weapons, the issue is not the length of training or the cost of maintenance. A few fundamental hardware and software problems had to be solved: JDAM kits were not designed to be used with Ukraine’s Russian-made bombs, and the country’s Russian warplanes cannot carry American-made bombs, nor can Russian flight computers communicate electronically with American guided munitions.', 'Since Poland, a former satellite of the Soviet Union, joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, some of its Russian MIG-29 warplanes have been converted to carry Western munitions, but that required replacing their Soviet-designed computer systems and some wiring with Western-made gear. A faster approach was needed for Ukraine.', 'The Pentagon has said little about how it made that work.', 'It took some MacGyvering, but the problem here was not unlike the one shown in the movie Apollo 13, where NASA engineers had to fit different parts together in order to save the lives of astronauts in space — figuring out how to “put a square peg in a round hole,” as the story went.', 'In 2022, engineers had to essentially do that, and much more, to make JDAMs work on Russian jets with the minimal modifications.', 'The standard bombs used by the United States and Russia are very different in design, as are the devices used to attach them to warplanes and drop them over targets.', 'American-made bombs have two small steel lugs that secure them to racks designed to hold them snugly at high speeds and to quickly push them clear of the plane’s fuselage when a pilot presses a button to drop.', 'By comparison, many Russian bombs have only one suspension lug, and the racks that drop them are incompatible with U.S.-made weapons.', 'The U.S. military solved the hardest part of this problem months ago, when Ukrainian pilots first started shooting the American-made high-speed anti-radiation missile, or HARM. An adapter was created to connect a device called a pylon and other parts that hold the weapon to the jet.', 'At Ramstein Air Base in Germany, a U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard team called Grey Wolf provides support to the Ukrainian Air Force, including on tactics and techniques, a military spokesman said.', 'Yes, quite a bit.', 'Carrying the bomb securely is one thing, but there are other problems. The electrical signal generated when a pilot presses the button to drop that bomb has to be converted to one that American-made devices recognize. And before being dropped, a JDAM needs data on the aircraft’s position and velocity as well as the target’s location fed into it electronically while the plane is in flight.', 'Newer types of American bomb racks and pylons offer solutions. One “smart” pylon used with the HARM missile is now in service with Ukraine’s air force.', 'The final piece is to transfer data from the cockpit to the pylon once all other conversions and adapters have been figured out, said Mike Pietrucha, a retired Air Force colonel who spent decades flying as a weapons officer on F-4G and F-15E fighters.', 'More than a decade ago, he said, the U.S. military developed a system to adapt an American-made GPS-aided weapon on a foreign aircraft using a laptop with a GPS device that connected to the smart pylon via Bluetooth.', '“Today, the same function could probably be accomplished using a tablet with a GPS attachment, and perhaps commercial flight software,” he added. “From there, the pylon would transfer the data to the bomb itself.”', 'Boeing says on its website that it has made more than 500,000 JDAM kits for the United States and allied countries.', 'How many are headed to Kyiv has not been made public, though it is likely that 500-pound JDAMs will be provided to start with. It marks a significant increase in Ukraine’s precision-guided munition capabilities.', '“It’s very important,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister who advises the government.']"

But Mr. Budanov’s comments were the most concrete yet in specifying that no intelligence now points to an imminent threat from Belarus.', 'None of the Russian troops are arrayed in assault formations, he said. Training camps for Russian soldiers are filled with newly mobilized civilians who, after completing training, are sent to fight in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The training sites lack sufficient armored vehicles in mechanically working order to stage an attack, he said.', 'Russia’s military has tried to raise alarms in the Ukrainian army by loading soldiers on trains that chug toward Belarus’s border with Ukraine, he said. The Soviet Union employed similar tactics during World War II, sending soldiers on useless train rides to imitate attacks or retreats. In Belarus, one train loaded with Russian soldiers stopped recently for half a day near Ukraine’s border, then returned with all the soldiers aboard, Mr. Budanov said, calling it a “carousel.”', 'Similarly, he said, Russia’s cross-border artillery shelling into the Sumy and Kharkiv regions of northeastern Ukraine, which has killed and wounded dozens of people, is not a harbinger of an immediate threat of a repeat invasion. Russian military units are not assembled for an attack and “cannot be formed in one day.”', 'In the southeast in the Donbas region, Mr. Budanov said, the political ambitions of the leader of a Russian mercenary army called the Wagner Group have partly dictated strategy on the Russian side.', 'The group’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin insider, has made a crusade of capturing the city of Bakhmut to upstage rival commanders in the Russian regular army, Mr. Budanov said. Wagner coordinates with the army but is the primary force in the Bakhmut front.', 'A Russian general appointed in September as commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin, has aligned with Mr. Prigozhin in a rivalry with the Russian minister of defense, Sergei K. Shoigu, Mr. Budanov said.', '“There is only an ideological and media question here,” he said of the fierce assault on Bakhmut. “That is a reason Wagner units are trying so fanatically to capture this town. They need to show they are a force, and they can do what the Russian army could not. We see that clearly and understand.”', 'While capturing Bakhmut is not considered strategically important, it would improve Russia’s position in the east by opening roads to other Donbas cities still under Ukrainian control, he said.', 'Wagner operates units of prisoners who are promised amnesty in exchange for a tour of duty on the front line, videos of the recruitment efforts in prisons show. These infantry units have been sent forward in costly human wave attacks at Ukrainian lines, Mr. Budanov said.', 'The alliance of Mr. Prigozhin and General Surovikin has led to the transfer of heavy weaponry from the army to the units of Wagner, expanding the organization’s role in the war, Mr. Budanov said. Wagner mercenaries had earlier fought in Syria and Africa. The group calls itself a private military company.', 'Russia’s war in Ukraine is now fought in two largely separate arenas: the ground battles in the south and east, and a contest between Ukraine’s air defense systems and Russian cruise missiles and drones aimed at electrical infrastructure.', 'Since October, Russia has fired volleys of missiles and drones at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in intervals of roughly a week to 10 days, Mr. Budanov said, with an average scale of about 75 missiles in each volley. The drones have been supplied largely by Iran, and Mr. Budanov said Russia is also counting on Tehran to replenish its missile arsenal.', 'To persuade Iran to support this effort, Russia has offered scientific know-how to Iran’s military industry, Mr. Budanov said, describing the geopolitical tie between Russia and Iran that has emerged during the war in Ukraine. But it only goes so far, he said. Iran has so far declined to support Russia with transfers of ballistic missiles, a risk Ukrainian officials had raised alarms about previously.', '“Iran is not hurrying to do this, for understandable reasons, because as soon as Russia fires the first missiles the sanctions pressure will grow” on Iran, Mr. Budanov said. Under a contract reached over the summer, Russia acquired 1,700 so-called Shahed exploding drones from Iran, Mr. Budanov said. They are delivered in tranches.', 'So far, Russia has fired about 540 of the drones, he said, in tactical strikes along the front line and in barrages aimed at power plants, pylons for transmission lines and electrical substations.', 'Most of the small, delta-wing flying bombs are shot down before reaching their targets. But they are also cheap.', 'In Iran, Mr. Budanov said, the manufacturing cost is about $7,000 per unit, though it is unclear how much Iran actually charged Russia for the weapons.']"

Putin played down the importance of the Patriot, saying Russia would find a way to defeat it.', '“An antidote will always be found,” he said at the Kremlin. “This is simply prolonging the conflict — that’s it.”', 'In some respects, the Biden administration’s acceptance of risk has increased as the war has gone on. Some weapons systems that were off the table early in the war, like the HIMARS rocket artillery and the Patriot missile defense system, have since been approved and either are in the fight or on the way.', 'But some American officials argue that it is the nature of the war that has changed, not the level of risk the White House will tolerate. Ukraine had a greater need for the HIMARS system once the war became a battle of artillery and Russian command posts pulled back off the front lines. The Biden administration decided to send the Patriot battery when Russia began launching sustained attacks on Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure as winter set in.', 'Both the HIMARS and Patriot systems require trained teams to operate them, so there is a cost to Ukraine to pull experienced soldiers off the front lines to learn how to use them. And the United States has only wanted to do that once they were sure the more sophisticated systems could make a real difference.', 'The administration’s current no-go weapons fall into three basic categories with some overlap, administration officials say.', 'The first group includes weapons like the long-range missiles called ATACMS, with a range of some 190 miles. The administration fears that if Ukraine gets in a bad enough bind, it could use the missiles to strike targets in Russia, prompting Mr. Putin to widen the war.', 'When asked about the missiles at a joint news conference with Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday, Mr. Biden cautioned that sending the arms could rupture NATO unity in support of Ukraine. “They’re not looking to go to war with Russia,” he said of the alliance. “They’re not looking for a third world war.”', 'Some former American commanders reject the administration’s reasons for holding back pivotal weapons at this crucial time in the war.', '“The administration continues to overestimate the risk of escalation and underestimate Ukraine’s cleverness and innovative ways of fighting,” said Frederick B. Hodges, a retired lieutenant general and a former top U.S. Army commander in Europe.', 'A second category covers weapons like armed MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9 Reaper drones, which proponents said would enable Ukraine to attack a broader array of targets or spot them for other Ukrainian strikes. But Pentagon officials have expressed concerns that if those drones are shot down or crash, Russia could recover them and exploit their advanced technology.', 'A third category covers weapons like the Abrams battle tank and F-16 fighter jets, some of the most advanced weapons in America’s arsenal. Pentagon officials say Ukraine already has enough tanks and fighter jets from other countries. More important, the officials say, the systems take months to learn how to use and require complex maintenance, usually done by civilian contractors, who might be unable to work safely in Ukraine.', '“These are tough choices,” said Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who serves on both the House intelligence and armed services committees. He said he supports sending Ukraine the ATACMS and F-16s, but not the battle tanks.', 'Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Ukraine needs additional munitions that the United States cannot easily provide.', '“We simply don’t have the stocks to supply, nor do we make the munitions that much of their equipment fires,” Mr. Murphy said.', '“What Ukraine needs is enough firepower to show Putin the limits of his power,” Mr. Murphy said. “Putin is never going to meaningfully come to the table unless he has seen in real terms where his power stops. And so that means you have to be perhaps willing to fund a stalemate for a period of time.”', 'Mr. Murphy also acknowledged the prospect that with a divided Congress — Republicans take control of the House next month, while Democrats will retain their majority in the Senate — aiding Ukraine may soon prove even more difficult.', '“Zelensky is always asking for the sky and that’s perfectly appropriate, and it’s our job to make sure his job is nimble enough to meet the moment,” Mr. Murphy said. “We also do have an obligation to the taxpayers to not waste money.”', 'With each new request from Ukraine for another advanced capability, the United States has tried to assess how Mr. Putin might react by looking at the Kremlin’s comments and at how Russia has responded in the past when the United States has aided its allies and partners in Europe.', 'One thing above all others has influenced the debate within the administration over what weapons system to give Ukraine: Russia’s restraint in keeping the war contained.', 'Russia has steadily increased the brutality and breadth of its attacks against Ukraine, killing civilians on the march to Kyiv, the capital, deporting children from occupied areas and now trying to break the will of the Ukrainians by attacking the electrical infrastructure to plunge the country into cold and darkness.', 'But Moscow so far has not let its war spill over into NATO territory. American officials continue to insist they have seen nothing that indicates Russia has decided to expand its attacks beyond Ukraine.', 'There have been no stepped-up cyberattacks by Russian intelligence agencies on NATO allies, and no evidence that Russia has conducted any sabotage attacks on allied countries.', 'Mr. Putin’s unwillingness to fight NATO directly has been key to the alliance’s ability to supply Ukraine with a steady flow of arms and ammunition, the very supplies that have kept Kyiv in the fight. Mr. Putin has shown he will accept high levels of international support for Ukraine, as long as those weapons are used in Ukraine. That, U.S. officials said, is the critical calculus: whether Mr. Putin will see a weapons system as something meant to attack Moscow, or something meant to be used inside Ukraine.', 'It is important, these U.S. officials say, not to give Mr. Putin an excuse to expand the war.']"

And the Ukrainian president surely knows his country’s remarkable resilience in the first year of the war could be threatened in the second, and the resolve of its saviors could begin to waver.', 'A Russian buildup of forces has many officials wondering if a humiliated President Vladimir V. Putin is plotting a new attack. And for the first time, there are hairline fractures — but not cracks — among some allies and partners, including a minority of Republicans who question whether America should be spending tens of billions for a nation that is not a treaty ally.', 'It was up to Mr. Zelensky to address all of that and make the case for more without actually reading out a shopping list. He did so in a speech that was carefully designed to appeal to many constituencies, one in which the Ukrainian president came off as grateful and yet gently demanding more. He wants Abrams tanks and F-16 fighters, layered air defenses and the Patriot missile system that President Biden announced would soon be on its way.', 'Not surprisingly, Mr. Zelensky, the performer turned politician turned media-savvy wartime leader, focused his appearance to highlight good news. Russia has been in retreat, America has provided ever-more-powerful weapons, there is plenty of money for more, and the Western alliance is still intact.', '“Ukraine is alive and kicking,” he told the joint session of Congress, appearing in a somewhat cleaned-up version of his instantly recognizable drab green T-shirt, a modest concession to the formality of a speech from the podium of the chamber.', 'Yet he acknowledged the sheer mass of the Russian force now being reassembled as Mr. Putin tries to recover from surprise Ukrainian victories such as those at Kherson and Kharkiv, where Russian occupying forces were driven into retreat this fall. American military commanders worry that the 300,000 Russian conscripts, even if quickly and poorly trained, will form a bigger enemy force than any thrown at Ukraine yet.', 'After thanking Congress for the weapons and ammunition it has provided, Mr. Zelensky asked: “Is it enough? Honestly, not really.”', 'A bit of nervous laughter swept through the House chamber.', 'He was, of course, turning to the real reason for his visit. From the start of the conflict, Mr. Zelensky seemed to intuit that he needed to be more than an inspiring leader — he needed to be an arms importer, coaxing out of the Biden administration longer-range weapons that could inflict on Russia the kind of damage it has wrought, with fiery efficiency, on Ukrainian civilian critical infrastructure. And by any measure he has been successful, gradually getting ever more powerful offensive and defensive weapons, even as Mr. Biden has withheld the F-16s and Abrams tanks.', 'On Wednesday evening, Mr. Zelensky tried to appeal to the minority of Republicans who are reluctant to spend more in a conflict whose end is nowhere in sight. He raised the surprising new role of Iran, whose provision of drones helped bail out Russian forces who were running out of precision weapons.', '“It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies,” Mr. Zelensky said, a clear reference to Israel. It was a subtle way of saying that the war is not just Ukraine’s fight, but part of Washington’s long standoff with a state sponsor of terror that is edging closer than ever to the capability — if not necessarily the intent — to build nuclear weapons.', 'With that one line, he married Ukraine’s recent confrontation with Iran over drones to Washington’s longstanding one over the Iranian nuclear program, part of his strategy of describing the war in his country as something bigger, a battle over preserving democracy and the post-Cold War world order.', 'And he made clear, without quite saying so, that the biggest mistake now would be to give Mr. Putin what the Russian autocrat most desires: time to let brutally low temperatures, extensive blackouts, water shortages and a campaign of terror from the sky break Ukraine’s will and fragment a surprisingly united Europe.', '“Russia is using winter as a weapon,’’ Mr. Biden said at his news conference with Mr. Zelensky at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, saying Russia was “freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another.”', 'The attacks on Ukraine’s power grid and water supplies have taken a grim toll, sending streams of refugees fleeing the country again, including tens of thousands who had returned to their homes over the summer.', 'Air defenses have taken down a large percentage of the drones and missiles fired at Ukraine’s cities and infrastructure, but the number of attacks is so overwhelming that plenty get through. There is little prospect that will change anytime soon; it will take months to build the kind of layered defenses needed to protect against the variety of attacks launched by Russia.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s aides, meanwhile, are publicly debating whether it is wiser to stay on the attack this winter or rest and regroup. A similar debate is underway in Moscow, American intelligence officials say. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister who is now an adviser to the Zelensky government, said in an interview that Mr. Putin “plans new mobilization and another offensive in the first quarter of 2023. That makes securing the right amount of military assistance for Ukraine critical.”', 'Many American officials disagree, and think that Mr. Putin is in no shape to risk another major military operation.', 'And while Congress is expected to soon pass a $45 billion package of additional arms and support for Ukraine, over the objections of a small but vocal group of Republicans, the longer-term question hovering over the discussions in Washington is how to think about helping Ukraine if the war stretches on for years, as many senior officials now say they expect.', 'Mr. Putin, they say, may have given up his hopes — at least for the next few years — of taking the entire country.', 'But they fully expect him to conduct a long, grinding conflict in the south and east, centered on the provinces he has declared are part of Russia. Mr. Putin himself got a bit of the last word on Wednesday, saying he would spend whatever it takes, and take whatever time is required, to meet his goals.', 'Clearly, so will Mr. Zelensky.']"

Col. Artyom Gorodilov.', 'The evidence shows that the killings were part of a deliberate and systematic effort to ruthlessly secure a route to the capital, Kyiv. Soldiers interrogated and executed unarmed men of fighting age, and killed people who unwittingly crossed their paths — whether it was children fleeing with their families, locals hoping to find groceries or people simply trying to get back home on their bicycles.', 'We identified 36 of the Ukrainian victims killed along Yablunska Street. Read more about their final moments.', 'Times reporters spent months in Bucha after Russian forces withdrew, interviewing residents, collecting vast troves of security camera footage and obtaining exclusive records from government sources. In New York, Times investigators analyzed the materials and reconstructed the killings along this one street down to the minute. Some of the most damning evidence implicating the 234th included phone records and decoded call signs used by commanders on Russian radio channels.', 'It all points to a brazen and bloody campaign that turned a quiet suburban street into what residents now call the “road of death.”', 'Historically, journalists and investigators relied on a single photograph or video to expose wartime atrocities. In 1992, Time magazine published a photo of an emaciated prisoner in Bosnia on its cover. Almost 20 years later, a video captured the execution of captured Tamil Tiger fighters in the final days of Sri Lanka’s civil war.', 'What differentiates the evidence discovered in Bucha are the scale and detail that link a single unit and its commander to specific killings, with possible implications for ongoing investigations. The International Criminal Court (I.C.C.) is already investigating possible war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.', '“This kind of digital evidence is a sea change, especially compared to past investigations such as in the former Yugoslavia,” said Matthew Gillett, a senior lecturer at the University of Essex who previously worked at international criminal courts. “If any Ukraine cases end up at an international court such as the I.C.C., it has to have a significant video component.”', 'Here are some of the main takeaways of the investigation.', 'While various military units were present in Bucha — and the death toll across the city reached over 400 — The Times identified the 234th Regiment, a paratrooper unit based in the city of Pskov in western Russia, as the main culprit in the Yablunska Street killings. Airborne units like this are considered some of the best trained and equipped in the Russian military. Evidence of the 234th’s involvement includes military equipment, uniform badges, radio chatter and packing slips on munition crates. Military experts from Janes and the Institute for the Study of War provided insights about Russian armored vehicles and their markings as well as tactical operations seen in the visual evidence.', 'Residents in Bucha said that when Russian soldiers interrogated them, they often seized their phones. Suspecting the soldiers may also have taken the phones of victims, our reporters obtained from Ukrainian authorities a database of all calls and messages placed from the Bucha region to Russia during March. As we interviewed victims’ relatives, we collected their phone numbers and checked if they were in the database. A chilling pattern emerged: soldiers routinely used the phones of victims to call home to Russia, often only hours after they were killed.', 'By analyzing the phone numbers dialed by Russian soldiers and uncovering social media profiles associated with their family members, The Times confirmed the identity of two dozen paratroopers as members of the 234th Regiment. In many cases, we interviewed their relatives and spoke to some of the soldiers themselves, two of whom confirmed they were in the 234th and served in Bucha. We cross-referenced our findings with personal data sourced from leaked and official Russian databases provided by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group focused on global security.', 'The Times identified — for the first time — three dozen people who were killed along Yablunska Street in March. We reviewed death certificates for most of these victims, and the predominant cause of death was gunshot wounds.', 'The victims were residents of Bucha or neighboring towns, from all ages and professions. Among the victims killed by Russian paratroopers were 52-year-old Tamila Mishchenko and her 14-year-old daughter, Anna, on March 5. They were among four women fleeing Bucha when Russian soldiers fired on their blue minivan.', 'Nearly all the victims we identified on Yablunska Street were civilians or Ukrainian P.O.W.s. Killing them could be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court and deemed war crimes under international humanitarian law. Because of their systematic and widespread nature, the killings in Bucha could also amount to crimes against humanity. Russia has not joined the I.C.C. and is unlikely to cooperate on any potential future cases that involve Russian soldiers.', 'The victims on Yablunska Street did not die in the crossfire between Russian and Ukrainian forces, nor were they mistakenly shot in the fog of war. Our investigation shows that Russian troops intentionally killed them, apparently as part of a systematic “clearing” operation to secure the path to the capital. Dozens of civilians were shot dead. In other cases, men suspected of links to the Ukrainian military were rounded up and executed.', 'Lt. Col. Artyom Gorodilov, the regiment commander at the helm of the 234th, oversaw operations of the paratrooper unit in Bucha. Times investigators obtained documents that confirmed the call sign he used when communicating over the radio with his troops. Security cameras along Yablunska Street captured some of this radio chatter, establishing that Lt. Col. Gorodilov was in command, and two soldiers in the 234th who served in Bucha confirmed in interviews that he was there.', 'After Russian troops retreated from the Kyiv region, Lt. Col. Gorodilov received a promotion to colonel in April from the then-head of the airborne forces, Col. Gen. Andrey Serdyukov. The ceremony was held days after the shocking images from Bucha emerged.', 'Neither General Serdyukov nor Colonel Gorodilov’s immediate superior at the time, Maj. Gen. Sergey Chubarykin, has publicly announced any investigations into the carnage in the town despite the global outrage over the images. As superior officers, they ultimately answer for the actions of the forces under their command.

Wednesday’s appearance at the White House offered a glimpse of the transactional nature of the relationship between the two men as Mr. Zelensky acknowledged what he would do after receiving a Patriot missile battery from the United States to help defend Ukraine from air attacks.', '“After that we will send another signal to President Biden that we would like to get more Patriots,” he said, to scattered laughter in the room.', 'The aside underscored both the human dynamic at play between the two men and Mr. Biden’s fears that providing too much military assistance, too quickly, could unleash a broader conflict with Russia and the West that would have even more dangerous consequences.', 'Later, when a reporter from Ukraine asked Mr. Biden why he didn’t just give Mr. Zelensky all the weapons he wanted, Mr. Biden quipped: “His answer is yes,” pointing at the Ukrainian president.', '“I agree!” Mr. Zelensky responded quickly in English, prompting laughter from the audience.', 'The visit to the White House comes as both sides gird for months of continued fighting.

It is critical, he argues, to stand up for the rights of sovereign nations when international law is violated.', 'That decision has not come without sacrifices and political cost for Mr. Biden, who rightly predicted before the war started that Americans would suffer economic consequences as the ramifications of the first war in Europe in decades rippled across the world. Gas and food prices spiked, helping to send inflation soaring in the United States and elsewhere.', 'Now, after rallying dozens of nations to oppose Russia’s invasion, Mr. Biden finds himself needing to hold that coalition together for longer than anyone inside the White House imagined at the start of the war.

But Mr. Zelensky arrives in Washington at a pivotal time for Ukraine, when his troops’ lightning counteroffensives from this fall are slowing down. He will be pleading for the more powerful weapons he believes Ukraine needs, but he will have to walk a fine line.', 'By taking a daring trip abroad during wartime, he is seeking to project strength and show confidence that Ukraine will ultimately prevail. But to make the case for continued financial and military support, he needs to draw attention to the dire threat Ukraine still faces without seeming weak.', '“President Zelensky would like to present this trip as serious progress in the war,” Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity Party, said in an interview. “It’s a pretty clear message that the alliance of the United States and Ukraine is maintained and is quite strong.”', 'In Ukraine, the visit was also seen as tied to the American political calendar, coming as control of the House passes to the Republican Party, some of whose members have voiced skepticism of continuing to funnel assistance to Ukraine.', 'Another of Mr. Zelensky’s principal aims, analysts say, is to maintain unified American support for the war, doing whatever he can to avoid having it devolve into a partisan issue.', '“Zelensky should not maneuver between the Democrats and Republicans,” Yevhen Mahda, a political commentator in Kyiv, said in an interview. “He should suggest a new paradigm — the paradigm that Ukraine today is at the epicenter of the battle between good and evil.', '“And by supporting Ukraine, the United States supports good,” Mr. Mahda added. “This is the necessary message.”', 'Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, has always had a keen sense of image and storytelling in politics, which is evident in his following up a frontline visit to the eastern city of Bakhmut — with booming artillery as a backdrop — with his address to Congress.', '“It’s an honor for me to be here today,” Mr. Zelensky had told the soldiers in Bakhmut, where Russia has been pressing a fierce offensive for months. To those with children, he said, “I wish that your sun, that is your children, will shine for you, for them to motivate you to survive, for sure, and defend your families, our families, all of our state and the future of our children.”', 'At a news conference on Wednesday with President Biden in Washington, where he delivered a personal plea for more economic and military support, he had a similar message when asked what he would want the world to know: “I wish you peace,” he said, switching from Ukrainian to English. “And you understand it only when the war is in your country.” He added: “I wish you to see your children when they will go to universities, and to see their children.”', 'Analysts say that Mr. Zelensky is also keenly aware that he needs to bolster the morale of his people, millions of whom are living without electricity, water or heating as winter sets in.', 'For the most part, however, Mr. Zelensky faced no political pressure at home and was free to tailor the trip to the imperative of filling out his military’s arsenal for the war.', 'The United States is by far the largest foreign supplier of weapons to the Ukrainian Army. But the Biden administration has carefully calibrated its assistance to Ukraine, holding back longer-range and more powerful weapons for fear of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory that could drag NATO into the war.', 'Two successful Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeast and in the south have run their course, and the Russian and Ukrainian armies are digging in along a new, 600-mile front line. To maintain that progress, Ukrainian officials and analysts say, its military needs more advanced weapons systems.', 'Mr. Zelensky will have the opportunity to address the concerns of U.S. lawmakers about the oversight of military and financial aid to Ukraine, and he could be pushed on domestic matters like press freedom, fighting corruption and ensuring checks and balances between the courts and executive branch.', 'But Mr. Zelensky’s major objective is to portray the war in stark terms of good versus evil that he hopes will transcend American politics and will give “a sense of the rightness of his cause and the sense of what his people and his soldiers feel,” said Yuri Makarov, the editor in chief of the Ukrainian national broadcasting company.']"

Putin delivered his own verdict on that criticism on Wednesday: It’s valid.', 'In an unusual acknowledgment of Russia’s shortcomings in a speech at the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Russian leader ticked off a list of areas his military must improve on. He declared that drones must be able to communicate targeting information through encrypted channels “in real time.” He said the military needed to “improve the command and control system” and its ability to strike back at enemy artillery.', 'And he nodded to the widespread reports of soldiers’ being sent to the front without basic equipment, instructing officers to pay attention to “medical kits, food, dry rations, uniforms, footwear, protective helmets and bulletproof vests.”', 'But far from an admission of defeat, Mr. Putin’s reference to his army’s woes reflected his defiant message on a day when Ukraine’s president put on a show of unity with the United States: Russia will keep fighting.', '“We have no limits in terms of financing,” Mr. Putin said, insisting that Russia would eventually prevail in Ukraine. “The country and the government are providing everything that the army asks for — everything.”', 'Even as Ukraine’s resistance captured the global spotlight with President Volodymyr Zelensky’s trip to Washington, Mr. Putin staged a showy gathering of his own, addressing members of Parliament and even Patriarch Kirill I of the Russian Orthodox Church for a speech at an annual meeting of the military’s top brass.', 'Comparing the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine to “the heroes” who warded off Napoleon’s invading army in 1812 and defeated Hitler in 1945, Mr. Putin implied that his war was just as existential — never mind that it was Moscow now doing the invading. He also sought to project an image of being in control of the war effort and attentive to the needs of the common soldier, at one point urging the gathered military brass to take “criticism into account.”', 'Just as important to the Kremlin, Mr. Putin sought to project an air of determination to the West: the notion that no matter how much arms support Ukraine gets, and despite the Russian military’s problems, the Kremlin remained determined to triumph in the end.', 'At the same time, Russian officials are reminding the West they are prepared to make a deal to end the war — on their terms.', '“Russia is always open to holding constructive peace talks,” Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, said after Mr. Putin spoke.', 'Mr. Shoigu promised to carry out changes in the military’s structure, set up new units and increase its target size by more than 300,000 service members. State television also showed Mr. Shoigu giving Mr. Putin a tour of modern Russian military equipment, including surveillance drones, night vision equipment and a medical tent.', 'But while the message seemed to be that Russia could correct mistakes on the fly and regain momentum in the war, experts cast doubt on whether this was realistic. The struggling Russian economy, weighed down by Western sanctions, will impose its own limits on how much the Kremlin can spend to improve its military.', '“They’re trying to deal with a sharp deficit in manpower and equipment and hurriedly put together something that’s falling apart,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst who is a visiting scholar at Tufts University. “The goal of all these attempts is to improve the negotiating position — probably not anything more.”', 'It was not known whether Wednesday’s event was purposely scheduled as counterprogramming to Mr. Zelensky’s high-profile visit to Washington, but it played that role for a Kremlin fiercely attentive to creating an aura of determination around Mr. Putin. Earlier in the day, the Kremlin stuck to its line that any further Western deliveries of weapons to Ukraine would only prolong the war.', '“All this, of course, leads to an aggravation of the conflict,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said, referring to new American arms deliveries, “and, in fact, does not bode well for Ukraine.”', 'In another bit of countermessaging, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former Russian president and the head of the governing United Russia party, met on Wednesday in Beijing with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, as Chinese and Russian naval ships began weeklong joint exercises in the East China Sea.', 'Mr. Xi’s rare in-person meeting with a foreign official served as a reminder that Russia retained the backing  of China, its most important international partner, even though Beijing had avoided declaring full-throated support for Russia’s invasion. Mr. Xi told Mr. Medvedev that relations between the two countries had “stood the test of international changes” and that their partnership was a “long-term strategic choice made by both sides,” according to the state broadcaster, China Central Television.', 'That kind of alliance is important for Mr. Putin as he squares off against the West. In follow-up remarks after his speech on Wednesday, he reprised his frequent contention that the goal of Russia’s adversaries was the “disintegration and weakening of Russia” and had been “for centuries — there’s nothing new here.” A war over Ukraine’s pro-Western turn, he claimed, was bound to break out sooner or later.', '“Of course, military operations are always associated with tragedy and loss of life,” Mr. Putin said. “But since it’s inevitable, better today than tomorrow.”', 'He claimed that Russia currently had an edge over the West in its nuclear forces, including its new hypersonic missiles, that helped create “a certain margin of safety.” While he did not repeat the more overt threats he made in September that he could use nuclear weapons, the comment was a reminder that Mr. Putin saw the Ukraine war as part of a large-scale struggle with the West in which his nuclear arsenal provides his ultimate backing.', 'After Mr. Putin spoke, Mr. Shoigu delivered a speech in which he detailed an expansion of the Russian military by more than 300,000 service members to a target size of 1.5 million. It was not immediately clear whether that expansion was meant to include the draft of about 300,000 soldiers this fall, but it appeared to be part of a push to further militarize Russian society.', 'Mr. Shoigu said that the age range for men who could be conscripted for their mandatory year of military service should be shifted to 21 to 30 from the current range, 18 to 27 — a measure that could make it harder for Russians to use their university studies to get deferments.', 'Mr. Shoigu also described planned structural changes, in particular to the Western Military District — an organizational entity whose troops are based across much of western Russia and, analysts say, performed particularly poorly in Ukraine.', '“It is an admission that the army turned out to be too small and that the elite Western Military District turned out to be ineffective,” said Dmitri Kuznets, a military analyst for the independent Russian-language news outlet Meduza.']"

But the tide of the war is likely to change in the coming months, as Russia improves its defenses and pushes more soldiers to the front lines, making it more difficult for Ukraine to retake the huge swaths of territory it lost this year, according to U.S. government assessments.', 'All of these factors make the most likely scenario going into the second year of the war a stalemate in which neither army can take much land despite intense fighting.', '“I do think that it is far easier for Ukraine to defend territory than to go on the offensive to recapture territory,” said Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official and Russia expert. “We need to be providing Ukrainians the necessary equipment and training to do that,” added Dr. Farkas, now executive director of the McCain Institute.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine asked for such assistance when he met President Biden and addressed Congress on Wednesday evening, his first visit outside the country since the start of the war. ', 'Over the past six months, Ukrainian forces have slowed Russia’s advance in the Donbas in the east, reclaimed a large swath of land in the northeast, and gained control of Kherson, a major southern city. But the wins came with a heavy cost: thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed and the expenditure of immense amounts of ammunition, in particular artillery rounds. In fact, throughout much of the year, Ukraine fired far more rounds of artillery in a week than the United States could produce in a month.', 'Though Ukraine’s military has consistently outperformed the Russian Army, senior Ukrainian officials have warned about the possibility of a major Russian offensive. But experts on the Ukraine war say Russia does not have the forces ready for any significant offensive in the next few months.', 'Ukrainian officials have said they plan to continue to press their counteroffensive against the Russians. The focus will be in the south, where the Ukrainian military and political leadership believe they need to make gains against Russian forces to restore critical Ukrainian territory.', 'American officials say Ukraine will most likely avoid sending its army directly into Crimea and will instead rely on more covert operations — similar to the attack on the Kerch Strait Bridge that knocked out a key Russian supply line — and airstrikes to attack Russia’s military positions in Crimea.', 'Ukrainian officials have told their American counterparts that it is critical to pin down Russian forces in Crimea. If they let up pressure there, the Ukrainians worry it would allow the Russians room to move more forces or defensive equipment out to other areas, according to U.S. officials who were speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions.', 'Ukraine has also been reliant on American intelligence reports that pinpoint where the Russian Army is at its weakest. The Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive outside Kharkiv in September was successful in part because the Ukrainians were facing hollowed out, unprepared Russian forces. American officials do not believe that even the Russian military command knew how weak those forces were or how badly prepared they were for a Ukrainian strike.', 'American officials are continuing to search for weak points in the Russian lines, hunting for units on the brink of collapse, which might melt away in the face of a sustained push by Ukraine. Finding those fragile units could allow for smaller victories by Ukrainian troops, American officials said.', '“What this war has shown us is that it is better not to underestimate Ukraine,” Colin H. Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, said in an interview.', 'Nevertheless, Kyiv’s ability to mount effective strikes against Russian bases and supply lines will not be enough to dislodge Moscow’s troops from the parts of the country where they are concentrated.', 'Any smaller breakthroughs by Ukrainian forces in the next few months are unlikely to lead to a broad collapse of the Russian Army, these American officials say, but Russia also is unlikely to achieve anything resembling a broad military victory in Ukraine.', 'Throughout the war, Russia’s advance has been hampered by a series of errors. Russian troops entered Ukraine with the intention of encircling, and then capturing, Kyiv, toppling the government of Mr. Zelensky and cutting off Ukraine’s southern access to the Black Sea.', 'The only marginally successful one of those efforts was the attack from the south, which eventually allowed Russian troops — after a protracted battle — to take Kherson and establish a land bridge to Crimea. (Although they never reached their original objective of Odesa.) But even the southern offensive eventually stalled, and Kherson, 10 months later, is back in Ukrainian hands.', 'When Russian units failed to follow orders, Russian generals were forced to go to the front to shore up units. And when those generals positioned themselves near communication arrays, they disclosed their positions, allowing Ukrainian forces to kill several Russian generals, American officials say. By failing to secure air superiority, Russian troops fought the first months of the war in contested skies, forcing their pilots to launch strikes from the border and then dart back to safety in Russia or Belarus.', '“This war favors the competent over the incompetent, as all wars do,” said Frederick W. Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who writes regularly about Russian operations in Ukraine. “The Russians have been unsuccessful because they are showing their customary incompetence.”', 'But American officials say there is evidence that the Kremlin is finally beginning to learn from its mistakes. It has put a single general in charge of the war — Sergei Surovikin — who American officials say is executing complicated military operations more efficiently.', 'In recent weeks, Ukrainian military officials have said Moscow has conducted stepped-up airstrikes on the army’s defensive lines, increasing Ukrainian casualties.', 'As botched as the initial Russian partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists was, the sheer numbers are now making a difference along the defensive lines. And unless those troops suffer a bad winter, which is possible with poor logistics and bad leadership, they will only shore up more by the spring, American officials said.', 'Russian forces are also digging into defensive positions and building trenches, and they have given up areas that require larger numbers of troops to hold, moving instead to easier-to-secure positions.', 'The retreat from Kherson, American officials said, is a key example of how Russia has learned lessons. While President Vladimir V. Putin initially blocked such a move, General Surovikin insisted it was necessary until Mr. Putin relented. The retreat allowed Russian forces to use the Dnipro River to protect themselves from further Ukrainian attack; the entire operation highlighted a sophisticated military execution that was unusual earlier in the war, American officials said.', 'General Surovikin, who has led Russian forces since October, is using a strategy that emphasizes strategic defense, these U.S. officials say. He has, so far, been able to improve defenses and inject discipline into Russian troops deployed in Ukraine’s south and east. Their current push in Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region is limited, intended to secure better positions from which to defend against a Ukrainian counterattack.', '“He’s consolidating positions, and he’s trying to build a network of trenches and a more sensible set of positions and checkpoints,” Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, said in a telephone interview.', 'Ms. Massicot said General Surovikin was also experimenting with new tactics for the Russian air force, including the manner with which it launches missiles at Ukraine to try to confuse its air defenses. These new Russian tactics will most likely result in a stalemate, leaving both sides jostling for the upper hand if any real negotiations were to begin.', 'In some ways, the war is becoming one that hinges on ammunition and supplies — two basic needs that can make or break either side.', '“It increasingly is a contest between the Western industrial base and Russian industrial base, with some aid from the Iranians, North Koreans and a few other countries,” said Seth G. Jones, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.', 'With Mr. Zelensky’s arrival in Washington, the Biden administration announced a new $1.8 billion arms package that would send one Patriot air defense battery to Ukraine, along with precision-guided munitions for fighter jets and other weaponry. Since the start of the war in February, the United States has sent more than $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine.', 'The package presented on Wednesday will include air defense batteries and precision-guided bombs for the first time. But even more weaponry for ground units will be needed to avoid a stalemate in the months to come, according to lawmakers and outside experts.', 'When the Ukrainians go on the offensive again, they will undoubtedly need more artillery and ammunition, said Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee who recently visited Kyiv. “But they will also need things like armored vehicles, tanks and other mobile platforms that can help them advance against entrenched enemy forces,” he said.', 'Ukrainian forces will also need a steady supply of anti-aircraft missiles, anti-armor systems, drones, loitering munitions — aerial systems that wait around passively in an area until a target is identified — vehicles and aircraft. They also need mundane items such as spare parts, petroleum, oil and lubricants.', '“Helping them replace depleted stockpiles and broken equipment is critical,” Mr. Moulton said.']"

Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine and as Congress considers approving nearly $50 billion in aid to help Ukraine’s forces battle Russia next year. That would bring the total amount of American aid to more than $100 billion.', '“He’s a national and global hero — I’m delighted to be able to hear from him,” Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said Tuesday after hearing of Mr. Zelensky’s visit.', 'The Ukrainian president’s trip comes as Russia’s assault heads into a second, brutal year. Russia’s hopes for a quick defeat of Ukraine failed, but have given way to a series of grinding and devastating attacks on civilians that have left major cities without heat or electricity in the bitter cold of Ukraine’s winter.', 'During his meeting with Mr. Biden at the White House, Mr. Zelensky is set to accept the latest American pledge of military assistance: a highly sophisticated Patriot missile battery that senior administration officials said would provide Ukraine with far better defenses against air attacks from Russian missiles and drones. The missile battery will be part of a nearly $2 billion package of security assistance that will also include other support for Ukraine’s air defenses.', 'White House officials said the announcement of the new security package by the American president — with Mr. Zelensky by his side — was meant to send a powerful message to Mr. Putin and other world leaders, along with people in Ukraine and America, that Mr. Biden would not waver in his efforts to help Ukraine defeat its Russian aggressors.', 'In her statement Tuesday night, Ms. Jean-Pierre said the meeting of the two leaders would “underscore the United States’ enduring commitment to Ukraine” and was part of a continuing effort by Mr. Biden to rally “the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.”', 'A senior administration official said that Mr. Biden would not come to the meeting on Wednesday “with a message that is about pushing or prodding or poking Zelensky in any way” toward finding a diplomatic end to the war with Russia. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip had not been formally announced, said Russia had given no indication it was willing to engage in good-faith talks about ending the war.', 'But the official also said Mr. Biden would not allow the United States to be drawn into an active war with Russia on Ukraine’s behalf, a pledge the president had made before Russian forces entered Ukraine at the end of February.', 'After meeting with Mr. Biden and members of his national security team, Mr. Zelensky is expected to hold a news conference at the White House, officials said. He will then head to Capitol Hill for what is likely to be an electrifying appearance before a joint session of Congress as Democratic control of the House — and the reign of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California as speaker — nears its end.', 'While Mr. Biden has vowed to continue his support “for as long as it takes,” he faces some resistance in Congress, where Republicans are poised to take control of the House on Jan. 3. Just hours before news of Mr. Zelensky’s visit broke, Republican leaders in that chamber had instructed rank-and-file lawmakers to oppose a roughly $1.7 trillion spending bill that includes the Ukraine aid.', 'Some Republicans in the House have repeatedly opposed previous packages that sent billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, suggesting the money is wasteful or better spent in the United States. On Tuesday, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a far-right Republican, posted on Twitter scoffing at the release of the new aid.', 'Others indicated late Tuesday that their support for Ukrainian aid would be outweighed by their opposition to the spending measure, which must be passed by Friday to avoid a government shutdown. Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said voting against the spending bill “doesn’t mean we don’t support Ukraine.”', '“Our first obligation is to the people we work for, not the people he works for,” he said of Mr. Zelensky.', 'The spending bill, including the funding for Ukraine, is expected to clear Congress by the end of the week, though votes for final passage have not yet been scheduled.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s trip to the United States was set in motion nine days ago during a telephone call between the two leaders, a senior administration official said. The White House formally invited Mr. Zelensky a week ago, and plans for a speech to Congress began in earnest on Sunday, when the government of Ukraine confirmed his intention to travel to the United States.', 'In the first days and weeks of the full-scale Russian invasion, a Russian attack intended to take advantage of the leader’s absence might have stirred confusion in the Ukrainian military. But 10 months into the war, no prominent military analyst has recently questioned Ukrainian command and control of the military.', 'However, Russia’s military and political leadership have an arsenal of missiles that are regularly fired at Ukraine, and a barrage timed for a presidential trip abroad would be within Russia’s capabilities. Such a salvo might serve as a distraction for Mr. Zelensky or as a signal to Ukrainians or American officials that Russia has options to respond to deepening U.S.-Ukrainian ties.', 'Before news of his visit was first reported by Punchbowl News on Tuesday evening, there were suggestions that an unusual session of Congress was in the works. Ms. Pelosi had sent a letter to all House lawmakers earlier in the day, asking them to attend the Wednesday night session in person even though they have the ability to vote remotely.', '“We are ending a very special session of the 117th Congress with legislation that makes progress for the American people as well as support for our democracy. Please be present for a very special focus on democracy Wednesday night,” Ms. Pelosi wrote.', 'Mr. Zelensky himself did not confirm his trip to the United States during a surprise visit to the battered city of Bakhmut on Tuesday. Mr. Zelensky was given a flag by Ukrainian soldiers who asked that he present it to Congress. He promised to give it to Mr. Biden, according to Ukrainian media who joined him on the trip.', 'While his office had no official comment on any imminent trip, the moment was captured on camera. It was not clear, however, that Mr. Zelensky was actually preparing to leave the country for the first time since the war began.', 'As the news of the potential visit emerged on Tuesday, multiple senators acknowledged it would be preferable for the Senate to pass the spending measure — including the security assistance for Ukraine — before Mr. Zelensky speaks to Congress.', '“That would represent a best-case scenario,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican. The spending bill passed a procedural hurdle on Tuesday with a resounding 70 to 25 vote.', 'A few lawmakers acknowledged that they had learned of the possible visit late Tuesday, but most lawmakers and aides appeared stunned by the news. While multiple senior lawmakers, including Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, have made trips to Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky has not left since the war began. He spoke to Congress virtually earlier this year.', '“That President Zelensky is going to make his first trip outside the country since the war began to speak to us, to thank us and to challenge us to continue to support the Ukrainian people, I think is the perfect ending to two years where President Biden has had some landmark successes,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who described Mr. Biden’s success rallying NATO and European allies behind Ukraine’s fight as the biggest international achievement this year.']"

Some Republicans have questioned the massive spending, while some progressives have called for peace talks.', 'The aid package consists mostly of military spending, including nearly $20 billion to arm and equip Ukraine’s forces, and to replenish Defense Department stockpiles from which weapons are being sent to Kyiv. Some of that money would also be used to bolster the defenses of America’s NATO allies to protect against further Russian aggression.', 'Another $6.2 billion would support a surge of U.S. forces in Eastern Europe that Mr. Biden ordered after the Russian invasion, including thousands of American troops deployed to Poland and Romania.', 'The “omnibus” budget bill, which includes the new Ukraine aid, funds the federal government into next year to avoid a shutdown. If Congress passes it, U.S. aid to Kyiv since Russia invaded in February will amount to more than $100 billion, allocated over four emergency spending packages. Congressional leaders hope to win approval for the spending this week.', 'In what was perhaps a reflection of the enormousness of the aid package and the speed at which it was assembled, Democratic and Republican appropriators differed in their calculations of the final price tag. Democrats placed the figure at just under $45 billion, and Republicans said the total exceeded $47 billion.', 'U.S. assistance has been essential to Ukraine’s survival and the major blow the country has dealt to Russia’s military, which badly miscalculated how much resistance Ukraine would mount. Mr. Biden has said that the defense of Ukraine was vital to the defense of democracy and the core principle of national sovereignty.', 'The package also includes nonmilitary aid to keep Ukraine’s government and economy running as it withstands Russian bombardments, which have increasingly targeted the nation’s infrastructure. Congress is proposing to spend $12.9 billion to shore up Ukraine’s economy and address dire energy shortages caused by Russian attacks.', 'Another $4 billion would go mainly to assist Ukrainian refugees, whose numbers are expected to grow as Russian attacks leave major cities without heat and electricity this winter. Some of that money would address the needs of migrants in other regions of the world.', 'Some Republicans have called for reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine, or imposing new oversight and conditions on the money. But a fact sheet published by Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which manages federal spending, boasted that the package rejects “the administration’s request to throttle down support for the Ukrainian war effort” — an apparent reference to the somewhat lower spending level proposed by the White House last month.', 'Mr. Biden has vowed to side with Ukraine against Russian aggression for “as long as it takes.”', 'A poll released earlier this month by the nonpartisan Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that about two-thirds of Americans favor continuing military and economic support for Ukraine, though less than half of Americans back continuing current levels of such support indefinitely, and a growing number — nearly half — favor pressuring Ukraine to settle for peace as soon as possible.', 'U.S. and Ukrainian officials insist that Russia is not prepared to negotiate in good faith. Moscow would exploit any truce or peace agreement for military advantage, they say.', 'The measure does contain several provisions ensuring that aid to Ukraine undergoes closer oversight. Some U.S. officials worry that American arms could be diverted or stolen for resale in a country long known for endemic corruption. The spending bill requires the Defense Department to report to Congress the steps it is taking to ensure that weapons are delivered and used as intended. It also provides $27 million to inspectors general at the State Department, Defense Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to monitor the aid.', 'In a sign of concern about the West’s ability to continue supplying Ukraine, and maintain its own diminishing stockpiles of arms and ammunition, the package provides $675 million over nearly three years to expand and modernize weapons factories in the United States. Several plants owned by the government and operated by private contractors date back to World War II or earlier, and modernizing them has long been a goal of the defense industry and the Pentagon.', 'Congress has also proposed spending $300 million on food security programs to help mitigate a global food crisis that has been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of a top exporter of grain and fertilizer.', 'And the measure provides $50 million in additional funds to combat cybersecurity threats from Russia, $105 million to clear land mines and other dangerous remnants of war in Ukraine and $300 million for Ukraine’s police and border guards.']"

He said these were “difficult, unusual times,” and praised Russian soldiers as “heroes.”', 'Context: Russia’s assaults on Bakhmut have been relentless. The besieged city is central to the fight to control all of the Donbas.

Putin of Russia summoned pro-war figures and propaganda leaders to an ornate hall in the Kremlin, where he honored them for their commitment to the invasion of Ukraine.', 'Mr. Zelensky was expected to make another daring trip on Wednesday — this time to meet with President Biden at the White House and address Congress, according to officials familiar with the planning. The plans were not final, and the risks involved — with the Ukrainian leader making his first known trip outside his country since Russia invaded — are high.', 'Mr. Putin’s televised event on Tuesday appeared aimed at showing his audience — both at home and abroad — that he was determined to continue the fight despite what American officials say are Russian casualties now exceeding 100,000 dead and wounded.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s visit to Bakhmut, whether by design or otherwise, stole some of the attention from Mr. Putin by showcasing the Ukrainian leader’s defiance and tolerance for personal risk in a city so devastated by repeated Russian assaults that it evokes images of the wastelands of World War I.', 'Ukraine’s success at retaining control of the city in the eastern Donbas region has lent it a symbolism that outstrips its military significance. “Bakhmut Holds,” read bumper stickers, artwork and T-shirts that can be found across Ukraine.', '“The east is holding out because Bakhmut is fighting,” Mr. Zelensky said as he presented medals to Ukrainian soldiers and posed for photos. “This is the fortress of our morale.

At the same time, Russian propaganda is presenting the war as existential — claiming that the true enemy is a NATO that seeks Russia’s destruction — and trying to brace Russians for further sacrifice.', 'Mr. Putin, in a brief speech at the end of the ceremony, said these were “difficult, unusual times,” and praised Russian soldiers as “heroes.”', '“When a country or even every person develops, moves forward, it always overcomes certain difficulties on this path,” Mr. Putin said. “But today, it’s indeed being accompanied by particular challenges.”', 'Hours earlier, Mr. Putin released a video message addressed to the employees of Russia’s security agencies in which he warned that the situation in Russian-held parts of Ukraine was “extremely difficult.”', 'In response, Mr. Putin suggested he would crack down harder.

But this month the Ukrainian military began a program to use drones in a more unusual role: to guide Russian soldiers who want to surrender.', 'The program had its genesis in late November, when the Ukrainian military released footage of a Russian soldier throwing his weapon to the ground, raising his hands and nervously following a path set out by a drone overhead, leading him to soldiers from the Ukrainian army’s 54th Mechanized Brigade.', 'A few weeks later, the Ukrainian General Staff released an instructional video explaining how Russian soldiers can surrender to a Ukrainian drone, and it is now part of a wide-ranging effort by Ukraine to persuade Russian soldiers to give up. The program, called “I want to live,” includes a phone hotline, a website and a Telegram channel all dedicated to communicating to Russian soldiers and their families.', 'It’s too early to know whether the drone effort will lure Russian deserters in any meaningful numbers. But it adds another avenue for Ukraine to recruit Russian deserters, this one with a distinctly modern twist to the age-old tactic of informational warfare. And if nothing else, it may further the erosion of Russian morale on the battlefield.', 'Russian defeats have already provided an opening for Ukraine to exploit that low morale, especially in the months after the Kremlin’s September mobilization, which has sent thousands of new recruits into fierce battles with little training and scant supplies.', 'Petro Yatsenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for Treatment of Prisoners of War, said in an interview Monday that Ukraine has had more than 4,300 direct requests for information on how to surrender through the “I want to live” program. It is not possible to independently verify the claims.', 'Mr. Yatsenko said the military would not release information about the number of Russians in Ukrainian captivity for security reasons.', 'Andriy Yusov, who represents the intelligence department in Ukraine’s ministry of defense, said Ukraine had received 1.2 million inquiries about the program  since it was set up on Sept. 18. Most of the queries are coming from Russia, he said, and the vast majority involved appeals from “people who are studying for themselves or their relatives the possibility of saving life in the bloody and unjust war.”', 'For the past ten months, both Russia and Ukraine have engaged in robust informational campaigns targeting enemy soldiers with leaflets, social media posts, radio appeals, text messages and television campaigns, all dedicated to convincing them to surrender.', 'In May, when the Russians were laying waste to towns and cities and beginning to gobble up land in eastern Ukraine, not all the guns were loaded with explosives. Some Soviet-era self-propelled howitzers had shells set up to explode in the air and scatter leaflets over Ukrainian-controlled territory, according to Zvezda, a Russian state-owned nationwide TV network run by the Russian Ministry of Defense.', '“We give the last warning to the Ukrainian Nazis to surrender,” an artilleryman named Vadim told the station. ', 'More recently, the Russians announced that its drone operators were sending SMS messages to Ukrainian mobile phone subscribers telling them to lay down their arms. There’s no evidence Russia’s “text-to-surrender” drones have had any impact.', 'The Ukrainian campaign has featured both high-tech and low-tech means of communicating. Artillery units routinely use Vampire multiple-launch rocket systems to fire projectiles filled with 1,500 leaflets each across Russian positions.', 'Hanna Malyar, a Ukrainian deputy minister of defense, said this was one way to give “Russian occupiers one last chance to yield themselves” when there was no internet connection.', '“Otherwise, the only thing that awaits them on the Ukrainian land is death,” she said.', 'Mr. Yatsenko, the spokesman for the prisoner of war group, said that Ukrainians were also giving captured Russian soldiers who are released as part of prisoner of war exchanges e-cards with information about how to surrender. That way, he said, if they are thrown back into the fight they know how to give themselves up.', 'When Ukraine captures Russian soldiers, it sends them to prisoner of war camps. The main one is in the northwest, near Lviv.', 'Ukraine has allowed some tightly controlled media visits inside that camp. They also allow routine visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross.', 'The most far-reaching Ukrainian effort is the “I want to live” program, which includes a Telegram channel in Russian that now has more than 40,000 subscribers, mainly in Russia or Russian-controlled territories. Phone operators also work around the clock at an undisclosed location in Kyiv taking up to 100 calls daily, Mr. Yatsenko said.', 'But just as surrendering was considered one of the most dangerous acts on the battlefield of the First World War, the same is true in Ukraine today.', 'With a frontline sprawling over hundreds of miles and the lands between the trenches a treacherous wasteland of mines watched over by snipers and subject to near-constant bombardment, arranging a surrender presents dangers for all involved.', 'That is where drones come in.', 'The surrender that was caught on the video released in November and geo-located by military analysts to the eastern Donbas region was an accident of sorts, Mr. Yatsenko said. It was not planned and the fact that it worked — with all the possible things that could have gone wrong — made the Ukrainian military think that it was an idea that could be expanded on, he said.', 'The Ukrainian General Staff set about producing a slick video with instructions for how Russian soldiers can surrender to a drone that was ready by early December.', 'The first step is to call the “I want to live” project and receive instructions and coordinates. “It is important to arrive at the indicated point on time, and wait for the appearance of the quadcopter, after which, raise your hands,” the video informs Russians.', '“After the drone shows the vector of movement, the prisoners must follow the drone,” they are told. The drone will fly at “walking speed” and “guide you to Ukrainian positions.”', 'If the drone’s battery fails, then the soldier must wait for a new one to arrive to continue moving.', 'Mr. Yatsenko said the “how to surrender to a drone” program is only in its infancy. He would not offer precise numbers for Russians who have surrendered to drones so far, but said it was more than a handful.', 'The Ukrainian program, Mr. Yatsenko said, is the first one designed to use drones on a broad scale as part of a coordinated operation to encourage surrender.', '“We are giving them a last chance to save their life,” he said.']"

It is one of several possible threats that Ukraine faces from Russia over the winter months, he said, as officials in Kyiv see little sign that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is seeking an end to the war.', '“Russia’s political leadership clearly refuses to acknowledge the tactical defeats that already took place and grasps at any, even the most illusory, chances to change the situation in its favor,” Mr. Podolyak said.', 'Ukrainian officials have said they base their assessments of Russia’s war aims on the findings of their military and foreign intelligence agencies and on consultations with allies.', 'In his comments, Mr. Podolyak said that Ukraine was taking the risk of a fresh Russian offensive seriously and emphasized that its allies should understand this, too. As Western governments plan for future weapons transfers to Ukraine, he suggested, the equipment should match the future threats.', '“It is extremely important that our partners take these risks no less seriously,” he said. “Russia is not interested in ending the war until it suffers a significant military defeat and is forced to focus on its own internal political transformation.”', 'Ukraine’s supreme military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview with The Economist published last week that Ukraine was training and outfitting reserves to defend against a new Russian offensive that might come in January, February or March.', '“The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops,” he said. “I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.”', 'The statements by senior Ukrainian officials appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign to guard against complacency among Ukraine’s allies as the Russian Army struggles on the battlefield. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Russia has fallen back in three major retreats — from the territory around Kyiv, in the northeastern Kharkiv region and, last month, in the southern region of Kherson.', 'The warnings also appear to be an attempt to counter the Kremlin’s efforts to persuade Ukraine’s Western allies to pressure Kyiv into a negotiated settlement.', 'In parallel with the fighting along the front lines, Russia has bombarded civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country, knocking out heating, water and electricity for millions of Ukrainians. In his nightly address to Ukrainians on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that electricity had been restored to six million people who lost power after a salvo of missile strikes on Friday. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Sunday that neighborhood heating systems damaged in the strikes had been fully restored.', 'Military analysts say that this campaign is intended to demoralize Ukrainians and push the Ukrainian government into a cease-fire that might allow Russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensives.', 'But analysts who rely on open-source intelligence have said it is difficult to know what is happening at Russian military training bases. The Kremlin said in September that it would mobilize 300,000 additional soldiers, and that some are already deployed in Ukraine.', 'Mr. Podolyak said that the type of mass infantry warfare Moscow seems to be preparing for would not be effective against Ukraine’s increasingly modern arsenal of precision-guided weaponry and surveillance drones. But he said that the Russian military leadership had bent to Kremlin demands for advances on the ground for domestic political reasons.', 'Russian commanders, he said, “diligently maintain Putin’s illusion of the possibility of ‘victory,’ in order to, firstly, maintain Putin’s personal power, and secondly, to avoid harsh punishment for admitting loss.”', 'In their most recent setback, Russian forces retreated last month from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson but remain within artillery range on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. Through the day on Sunday, Russian forces fired artillery at Kherson, wounding three people, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy presidential chief of staff, said in a post on Telegram.', 'In its morning update on the status of the battlefield on Sunday, the Ukrainian military said that it had repulsed 15 ground assaults on its positions over the past 24 hours and that multiple frontline towns and villages had been targeted by Russian artillery.', 'Most of the attacks came in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine, the only section of the front line where the Russian Army is regularly staging offensive attacks. Along much of the rest of the crescent-shaped front line in southeastern Ukraine, Russian forces are in a defensive crouch, building fortifications along new lines after their retreats earlier in the fall.']"

A table tennis coach from a small city in Siberia, he had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. But at age 30, he died from shrapnel wounds when a tank shell exploded near him in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk Province on Nov. 20.', '“He responded to a call from his heart to join the special military operation,” said a short memorial article in a local newspaper on Dec. 8. ', 'That brief account got Mr. Tsvigun added to a list of confirmed Russian war deaths maintained by a small, dedicated team of data journalists and volunteers, as the Kremlin has largely avoided updating the number publicly. Run by Mediazona, the independent Russian news outlet, with the BBC’s Russian service and about a dozen anonymous volunteers in Russia, the list pulls information from sources like newspaper articles, photographs on tombstones, fellow soldiers mourning their comrades and even tips from relatives who want their loved ones included in the tally.', 'The list has surpassed 10,000 names, including more than 400 Russians drafted recently.', '“If the Russian government does not count Russian casualties, then someone has to do it,” said David Frenkel, one of four data reporters from Mediazona running the project. “It is important for us to explain to Russians the cost of the war,” he added. “If they do not understand the cost from the pictures of devastated Ukrainian cities, then maybe the number of dead Russians will make them think about it.”', 'The Russian government has tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has updated the number exactly twice: once at the end of March and again in September, when the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed since the war started.', 'That official number is notably smaller than estimates from Western military and intelligence officials. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, said in November that Moscow’s casualties were “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded.”', 'There have been similar estimates for Ukrainian losses, with Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling a Ukrainian news station this month that up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops had died in the conflict.', 'With so much fog of war shrouding the subject, Mediazona decided that online sleuthing was needed to establish a baseline of Russian deaths. A scattered group of volunteers in Russia was already trying to document the deaths on their own, and the BBC News Russian service had done several articles on the subject, so they combined forces.', 'They did not set out to document every death, and estimated that their Russian count was about one-third to half the true total. But by harvesting as much information as was available from social media posts and putting a name to every death listed, they figured their number was better than an estimate.', '“It is not just about the number; it is about who died or how they died,” said Maxim Litavrin, another data journalist at Mediazona.', 'Ukrainians upload a higgledy-piggledy stream of information about Russians killed in the war on several channels on the Telegram messaging application, including the names of the deceased. The team of volunteer investigators in Russia then search social media posts for the names. ', 'All the information from open sources ends up on a huge spreadsheet. The journalists work quickly to check the links and to back up everything because personal posts often disappear. They crosscheck names against a government website that lists people deceased throughout Russia but that does not specify military deaths.', 'Seven out of 10 confirmations come from local news reports, the data journalists said, while the others are a mix. They include announcements from local officials or employers; individual posts on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook; and sources like pictures of memorial plaques put up in dead soldiers’ former schools.', 'Every two weeks, Mediazona crunches all the numbers to break down the toll on its website, including deaths by region, military unit and age.', 'The results can vary drastically by region. In Dagestan, Russia, for example, where serving and dying in the Russian Army is considered an honor, officials tend to make statements about those killed.', 'In some regions like Krasnodar, volunteers have counted hundreds of war dead by visiting cemeteries. Even temporary tombstones in Russian cemeteries usually include a picture of the deceased, along with the name, military unit, date of birth and date of death.', '“Cemeteries give us a lot,” Mr. Frenkel said.', 'Military analysts have mixed views on the project. Some prefer to work with estimates of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total. Others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying patterns.', '“The project is a useful snapshot of the breakdowns and wider patterns in Russian losses,” said Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. “We know that Russian authorities are simply not presenting truthful reporting on losses.”', 'One early pattern, for example, showed that about 20 percent of Russia’s war deaths were officers. “That told us a lot about how the Russian Army operates,” said Olga Ivshina, a reporter with the BBC Russian service who alternates with Mediazona each week to tally the numbers. It turned out that senior Russian officers were initially deployed near the front lines because junior officers could not issue orders.', 'The information available online varies widely.', 'A local community page posted pictures showing Alexander A. Dementov, 28, and Alexander Trokhov, 38, after they were drafted at the end of September. They were both workers at the Nadezhdinski Metallurgical Plant in Serov, a Russian city in the Urals. Then, a local newspaper reported on Dec. 7 that both men, who had served in the 55th motorized rifle brigade, died in a missile strike on Nov. 23.', 'Sometimes, the details are sparse.', 'Vsevolod Matveev was No. 10,000 on the spreadsheet. The data journalists discovered that he was from the Sverdlovsk region in the Urals and that he was buried on Dec. 9 in the town of Zarechny. From his picture, they could tell that he had served with a motorized infantry unit. But that was it.', 'When deaths cannot be confirmed by open sources, the names are put on a side list awaiting further details. ', 'The Mediazona reporters noted that resistance to the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya developed in tandem with the death toll, but there has been little sign of that in Russia.', 'Spending every day scrolling through information about dead people is mentally taxing, they said, but certain posts stick with them. Mr. Litavrin remembers reading about a 40-year-old man who had a quiet, regular life and a daughter, and volunteered in August. He was killed after two weeks on the battlefield.', '“I wondered what he was thinking,” Mr. Litavrin said. “It’s terrible.”']"

The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.', '“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. “So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”', 'But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.', 'Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.', 'And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.', 'The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.', 'The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.', '“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down.

At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.', 'And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. (The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)', 'Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.', 'In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.', '“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. “Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”', 'That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.', 'These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.', 'Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.', 'Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D.

Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”', 'The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.', '“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. “Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”', 'Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.', 'The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.', 'That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.', 'The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.', 'In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.', '“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. “We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”', 'The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.', 'Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.', 'Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.', 'Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.', 'These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $65.3 billion from $67 billion.', '“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.', 'But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.', 'Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.', 'Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.', '“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. “Nothing’s free.”']"

Putin of Russia made a surprise visit to a command post coordinating the Russian war effort in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Saturday, in a rare demonstration of hands-on involvement in the military campaign’s execution and planning.', 'Mr. Putin spent the day on Friday in the military headquarters in an undisclosed location, presiding over a general meeting with Russia’s top brass and holding separate ones with various commanders, the Kremlin said in a statement. In his opening remarks, carried on Russian state television, Mr. Putin said he had come to listen to his commanders’ proposals about the Russian military’s “short- and medium-term movements.”', 'As Russia’s military campaign has suffered a series of painful and embarrassing setbacks, Mr. Putin has distanced himself from the blunders, clearly unwilling to associate himself with defeat. All the while he has maintained a studied calm, insisting against all reason that the war is “going according to plan.”', 'For instance, Mr. Putin never commented publicly about his army’s retreat from the city of Kherson — the only Ukrainian regional capital Russia had captured since the invasion in February. He also never made public visits to the front lines or even to territories captured by Russia. Instead, Mr. Putin concentrated on economic affairs, such as opening a turkey breeding factory in Siberia in November, trying to show that it was all business as usual in Russia.', 'The Friday meeting demonstrated a shift in that approach, Russian war analysts said. While few people doubt that any major military decision can be made in Russia without Mr. Putin’s approval, the fact that the Friday meeting was made public meant that the Kremlin wants to send a clear signal that the Russian leader is in charge and is interested in the war’s progress, said Yuri Fyodorov, a Russian military analyst.', '“Mr. Putin demonstrated that he is responsible for the situation at the front,” Mr. Fyodorov said in a telephone interview. “This is not a coincidence in light of reports that Russia might be getting ready to launch an offensive in Ukraine.”', 'Besides the stagecraft designed to show he is in control, the meeting served a number of other ends for Mr. Putin, analysts said. It presented a rare occasion for him to appear together with his top commanders, the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, and the chief of general staff, Valeri V. Gerasimov, who have faced heavy criticism from Russian military bloggers and are frequent targets of rumors of their dismissal. And by mentioning “mid-term” planning, analysts said, he was able to emphasize his determination, if any was needed, to see the war through to its conclusion.', 'In the early stages of the war, Mr. Putin delegated the decision-making to various branches of the military. That has blurred lines of responsibility, but also undermined coordination between troop formations. In October, as it became clear even to the war’s supporters that Russia’s initial drive into Ukraine had failed, Mr. Putin appointed Gen. Sergei Surovikin as the commander of the country’s forces.', 'Some analysts have speculated that General Surovikin was appointed as a scapegoat to shift the blame from Mr. Putin. For instance, shortly after his appointment, the general announced that “tough decisions” might be coming. In early November, he called for the withdrawal from Kherson.', 'Dmitri Kuznets, a military analyst for the independent, Russian-language news outlet Meduza, said that Mr. Putin’s visit to the war headquarters was a way to demonstrate that the Russian president “keeps his finger on the pulse and wants the upcoming decisions to be associated with him.”', 'However, he said, “there are no signs that Russia is preparing a large-scale ground offensive operation.”', '“Russia is trying to build a new army now because the old one has been depleted,” he added, noting that Russian troops are trying to master modern war methods on the fly — something many military analysts say is better done through years of training away from the pressures of the battlefield.']"

Putin’s state of mind, the stunning failures of his military, and U.S. efforts to prevent a direct war with Russia.', 'Here are eight takeaways from the report.', 'Reached by phone inside Russian hospitals, wounded soldiers described being sent to war with little food, training, bullets or equipment — and watching about two-thirds of their platoon get killed. Materials recovered from battlefields point to the military’s lack of preparation: a map from the 1960s, a Wikipedia printout on how to operate a sniper rifle, a wildly optimistic timetable for Russia’s invasion. In interviews, one soldier recalled asking how to use his rifle just before heading off to battle, while another described how his supervisor revealed they were going to war: “Tomorrow you are going to Ukraine to fuck up some shit.”', 'Many of the people closest to Mr. Putin fed his suspicions, magnifying his grievances against the West. A former confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social media algorithm: “They read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff.” Mr. Putin planned the invasion in such secrecy that even Dmitri S. Peskov, his spokesman, said in an interview that he learned of it only once it had begun. Anton Vaino, Mr. Putin’s chief of staff, and Aleksei Gromov, Mr. Putin’s powerful media adviser, also said they did not know in advance, according to people who spoke to them about it.', 'The United States tried to stop Ukraine from killing a top Russian general. American officials found out that Gen. Valery Gerasimov was planning a trip to the front lines, but withheld the information from the Ukrainians, worried that an attempt on his life could lead to a war between the United States and Russia. The Ukrainians learned of the trip anyway. After an internal debate, Washington took the extraordinary step of asking Ukraine to call off an attack — only to be told that the Ukrainians had already launched it. Dozens of Russian soldiers were said to have been killed. General Gerasimov wasn’t one of them.', 'A senior Russian official told the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, last month that Russia would not give up, no matter how many of its soldiers were killed or injured. One NATO member is warning allies that Mr. Putin might accept the death or injury of as many as 300,000 Russian troops — roughly three times his estimated losses so far. Before the war, when Mr. Burns warned Russia not to invade Ukraine, another senior Russian official said Russia’s military was strong enough to stand up even to the Americans.', 'Days into the invasion, Mr. Putin told Israel’s leader that the Ukrainians had turned out to be “tougher than I was told.” But, he warned the leader, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, “we are a big country and we have patience.” Earlier, in October 2021, during his first meeting with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Putin had railed against President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine: “What kind of Jew is he? He’s an enabler of Nazism.”', 'Invading Russian soldiers used their cellphones to call home, enabling the Ukrainian military to find and kill them. Phone intercepts obtained by The Times showed the bitterness Russian soldiers felt toward their own commanders. “They’re preparing you to be cannon fodder,” one soldier said. Another described a commander warning him he could be prosecuted for leaving his position, only for the commander to flee when shelling began. “His wheels didn’t even get stuck in the mud,” the soldier said.', 'The day of the invasion, Mr. Putin set a trap for Russian business tycoons, putting them on television “to tar everyone there,” as one of them described it. Indeed, the businessmen present were all hit by Western sanctions in the months that followed. Even so, another billionaire at the Kremlin that day, Andrey Melnichenko, was defiant, insisting sanctions would not make Russian tycoons turn against Mr. Putin. “In textbooks, they call this political terrorism,” he said.', 'Mr. Putin’s fractured armies have sometimes turned on each other; one soldier said a tank commander deliberately fired on a Russian checkpoint. Mr. Putin divided his forces into fiefs, some led by people who are not even part of the military, such as his former bodyguard, the leader of Chechnya and a mercenary boss who has provided catering for Kremlin events, Yevgeny Prigozhin. In an interview after being captured by Ukraine, one Russian soldier said he had been in prison for murder when Mr. Prigozhin recruited him. Later, after he was returned to Russia in a prisoner swap, a video emerged of his execution by sledgehammer.']"

We have enough soldiers — give us weapons.”', 'The barrage came as Ukrainian military and political leaders warned in a series of interviews and news conferences that Russia was preparing for a new ground offensive this winter, and would likely make another attempt to seize Kyiv. They did not cite specific intelligence, but their statements amounted to a coordinated pushback against talk from Moscow — and some officials in the countries backing Ukraine — about possible peace negotiations.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky and his top advisers insist that Russia, which invaded unprovoked in February, is not serious about peace, and that any pause in the war would only give the Kremlin time to cement its grip on the territory it has seized, and to rebuild its forces for a renewed assault on Ukraine. Officials in Kyiv fear that their Western backers, wearying of high energy prices and the cost of supplying Ukraine, might be all too eager to accept a cease-fire.', 'Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, told the Guardian newspaper that a new Russian offensive could come as soon as February. General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the country’s top military commander, said in an interview with the Economist that it “may take place in February, at best in March, and at worst at the end of January,” and could come from the east, north or south.', '“The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops,” General Zaluzhnyi said. “I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.” He did not cite evidence for either assertion.', 'Russia’s military has been badly mauled in the war, suffering, by Western estimates, more than 100,000 casualties and seriously depleting its supply of missiles and armored vehicles. President Vladimir V. Putin in September ordered the call-up of 300,000 conscripts, some of whom have been deployed to Ukraine, often with inadequate training or equipment.', 'Western officials and military analysts said that Ukraine’s assessment of Kremlin intentions was probably correct, and that Mr. Putin still aims to subjugate Ukraine, even if his capabilities may not match his ambitions. And U.S. officials have made clear that they do not expect the war to end any time soon.', 'But experts said they did not see evidence so far of Russian forces preparing for a major new push, and questioned whether they would be able to mount one over the winter, though it is difficult to know what is happening on Russian bases.', '“We’re not seeing any indication of an imminent move on Kyiv,” John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters in Washington, although he emphasized that Mr. Putin had not abandoned his “maximalist” aspirations to control Ukraine, and could at some point seek to expand the war again.', 'Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst and the director of Rochan Consulting, said it seemed unlikely that Russia would be able to mount a large-scale counterattack in the next two to three months given its heavy losses, current failures to prepare soldiers for winter combat, and continuing logistical and organizational struggles.', 'With their troops losing a large chunk of the territory they had conquered in eastern and southern Ukraine, Russian forces this fall dramatically increased their aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure across the country, in an apparent bid to terrorize and immiserate the population and sap its will to fight.', '“They still have enough missiles for several such heavy strikes,” Mr. Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “We have enough determination and self-belief to return our own after these blows.”', 'In the interview with the Economist, General Zaluzhnyi struck a more ominous tone.', '“We are balancing on a fine line,” he said. If the Russians destroy the grid, “that is when soldiers’ wives and children start freezing.” At that point, he said, “What kind of mood the fighters will be in, can you imagine? Without water, light and heat, can we talk about preparing reserves to keep fighting?”', 'The Russians have fired ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and Iranian-made exploding drones, and there are fears that they will also turn to Tehran to replenish their stocks of ballistic missiles. The Biden administration is expected to supply Ukraine with a Patriot missile battery, the most advanced American air defense system, which, unlike others used by Ukraine, can shoot down ballistic missiles flying at several times the speed of sound.', 'Ukrainian air defenses have become adept at deflecting the attacks, so Russia has taken to firing missiles and drones in large swarms, as many as 100 at a time from multiple directions, to overwhelm those defenses and allow some to penetrate. But recent experience shows that even a few reaching their targets can do significant and lethal damage, and sometimes falling debris from missiles that are shot down does, as well.', 'General Zaluzhnyi said in a statement that Russia had launched 76 projectiles at infrastructure targets on Friday across Ukraine, whose air defenses managed to shoot down 60 of them. That ratio is actually below recent standards. Large explosions were reported in cities across the country, including the three largest, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s deputy chief of staff, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said that emergency power outages were being introduced “across the country” to ration energy as crews scramble to repair the damage. “We ask for your understanding regarding the power outages and temporary water and heat supply interruptions,” he said in a statement.', 'Ukrenergo, the national electric utility, said that after the strikes it was able to meet less than half the country’s energy demand. In the central Kirovohrad region, roughly a million people were left “completely without electricity,” said Andriy Raikovych, the head of the regional military administration.', 'Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko, said that as many as nine power-generating facilities had been damaged, along with transmitting substations, the Ukrinform news agency reported.

The cold numbed their fingers as they set up their equipment: a laptop-size thermal imaging sight, its tripod and a Starlink satellite dish and battery.', 'The job was straightforward: The small team of several men, led by an American known as Wolf, would be Ukraine’s eyes on their battle for Bakhmut that night, huddling in the Soviet-style apartment and staring at the white-and-black glow of infrared images as it tried to identify Russian positions.', 'In front of them was a panoramic view of Bakhmut, a city in Ukraine’s east, mostly without power and devastated by six months of concerted shelling. Russian artillery strikes in the distance sent white flashes into the sky under a blood red moon. Rockets arced on the horizon.', 'One of the team members powered on the thermal sight and it whirred to life. He turned to his colleague who was fiddling with the satellite dish, trying to connect to the internet. “Comms green?” he asked.', 'What unfolded over the next half-dozen hours was a routine but essential part of the daily rhythm of the war — part drudgery and part urgent calculation as the team ascertained the coordinates for enemy positions, relaying them to the Ukrainian artillery battery miles away.', 'This type of mission, observed over the course of two days this month by reporters for The New York Times, was a window into how the war is being fought — a battle that is relentlessly violent but also technically sophisticated.', 'At its core, the fighting for Bakhmut looks little different from a battle in the Eastern European steppes of World War II: armies committing troops, tanks and massive artillery barrages to capture ground.', 'But Wolf’s team, armed with a satellite hookup and a thermal optic that can see a person up to five miles away, quickly showed how much war had changed in the last 80 years.', 'Driving in almost complete darkness behind a mud-stained van carrying the rest of his team, Wolf turned off his headlights as he reached the outskirts of Bakhmut. Before losing signal, he was informed by Ukrainian intelligence of at least one Russian Orlan-10 drone flying over the city.', 'In the days past, he said, there had been many more of the lawn mower-sounding crafts, but on this night, the low-hanging winter clouds were obstructing their visibility.', 'Without the drones, he added, Russian troops would be unable to direct their own artillery fire.', 'It was little consolation. The distant chatter of machine gun and cannon fire and the dull thuds of explosions were reminders that the fighting was close.', 'The team is part of Ukraine’s foreign legion, a unit created at the start of the war that has supplied thousands of international volunteers to bolster Ukraine’s ranks. Wolf, a 29-year-old former U.S. Marine, came to Ukraine because, as he put it, “I’m a good Christian and it was the right thing to do.”', 'The other members of his team include a Ukrainian, the translator; a Canadian; a Briton and an Australian. “No English,” Wolf stressed before they left the vehicles. Many of the remaining residents of Bakhmut were already suspicious of foreigners, especially those with rifles. The Times is referring to Wolf and the other soldiers by only their call signs to protect their identity.', 'After months of the Russian Army’s trying to capture the city, the fighting around Bakhmut, which had a prewar population of around 70,000, has devolved into two main sectors: the south and east. Russian troops were pushing from both sides to try to strangle the city’s supply lines.', 'Wolf’s apartment-turned-observation post could see both approaches with the thermal sight. The icy tree lines and the fields shone bright white; anything living or heated by an engine or by electricity showed up as a black blob.', 'The team member charged with finding Russian targets is a former artilleryman from Canada, who goes by the call sign Bear. He scanned the horizon with the thermal sight, shifting between the east, where the Russian soldiers had edged closer to a reservoir in the city, and the villages to the south.', 'But even if the team did spot a Russian tank or an advancing platoon, there was little they could do: They had no internet, and there was barely any cell service left in the city.', 'The translator, who is from the northern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv with the call sign Popov, fiddled with the Starlink’s concave, rectangular dish. He raised it so that it was level with the apartment’s mangled balcony, careful to keep it just low enough so that their Russian counterparts would miss its heat signature.', '“Still searching for satellites,” he shrugged.', 'The balcony had been shelled before, and the door leading into the apartment had been destroyed. It appeared as if a small family had once lived there. A crib sat in the corner of one room. Wallpaper had started to peel on a wall where the roof leaked.', 'About an hour earlier, before the moon had slipped into the clouds, the Starlink had managed to connect to the internet. For a brief period, the team had access to the Ukrainian military group communications focused on Bakhmut, where units along the frontline were sharing known Russian positions and trying to coordinate for the night.', 'The team’s primary connection was the direct line back to the Ukrainian officers overseeing the artillery around the city, including the U.S.-supplied M777 howitzers loaded with GPS-guided shells. This time, the team had some information.', '“Looks like they’re advancing on the eastern side,” Bear said, referring to Ukrainian troops. The Canadian had the thermal sight pressed to his eyes.', 'Indeed, outlined on the white screen were small black dots advancing into the trees near Bakhmut’s eastern reaches.', 'The crumps of artillery impacts drifted back to the apartment as the Russian forces responded to the attack. A tank, hit during the advance, burned in the distance. It appeared as a violent black plume of smoke on the thermal imager but only as a red speck to the naked eye, as if it were a distant star on the edge of the blacked-out city.', 'Bear continued to scan toward a village to the south, where Russian troops were trying to advance but had instead run into staunch Ukrainian resistance.', 'Much of the village had been destroyed in recent fighting. Now, members of the team said, the Ukrainian soldiers there were fighting building-to-building in close-quarter gun battles with their Russian adversaries.', '“Got something,” Bear said.', 'His colleague, Dog, a former British Army bomb disposal technician who fought in Afghanistan, perked up and turned on his tablet.', 'He covered the screen and his face with a scarf, careful to prevent the backlight from compromising their position. He read the coordinates back.', 'The team had spotted what looked like two Russian transport trucks (given their size and their black thermal outline on the screen) idling in the middle of a field several miles away, well behind Russian lines.', 'Popov carefully sent the coordinates through the Ukrainian artillery channel.', '“Anything else? Are there troops around it?” he asked. Bear looked back into the sight. No. The trucks were just sitting there.', 'Message sent, Popov said. “Let’s see if they do anything with it.”', 'The Starlink stopped working shortly after.', 'Sitting in the abandoned apartment, the team faced several obstacles: destroyed cell towers; thick, low clouds disrupting the Starlink; and GPS jamming by the Russians  that was throwing off the thermal sight.', 'They worked on the Starlink, rebooting it and disconnecting it from its portable battery to no avail. The clouds were too dense.', 'In the distance to the northeast, dark red streaks of Russian Grad rockets streaked toward the heavily contested town of Soledar.', 'But the shelling, for the most part, had subsided. The Ukrainians held fire on the two idling trucks. Guided artillery shells are available in limited quantity and often only used on important targets.', 'Through the thermal sight, Bear observed what looked like a platoon of Ukrainian soldiers trying to advance near a village on the city’s southern outskirts — one of the many attacks and counterattacks that have become a staple of the battle for Bakhmut, where significant gains have been minimal.', 'It was around then that rocket fire echoed to the south. Seconds passed. The sky exploded. In a flash over the village the low clouds glowed white for what seemed like minutes as the contrails of incendiary munitions drifted to the ground.', '“There’s nothing left to burn there,” a member of the team remarked from the darkness as the embers settled. “It’s all been destroyed.”', 'Someone took a picture on their phone. The team would leave in an hour, their mission over without the Starlink.', 'But the long night in Bakhmut was just beginning.']"

Although the organization has not changed its formal guidance from February, there are signs that it is looking to ease its restrictions.', '“We need to explore ways to overcome this dilemma with regard to athletes’ participation and come back to sporting merits and not political interference,” Mr. Bach said in a news conference last week, according to Reuters.', 'Mr. Bach emphasized that the I.O.C.’s original guidance was for athletes’ safety. “What we never did and did not want to do was prohibit athletes from competing in competitions only due to their passports,” he said, adding that the I.O.C. had not yet set a date by which to make a decision.', 'In the past, athletes from countries under Olympic sanctions had been allowed to compete under an Olympic flag rather than their national flag. Russian athletes did so in the Beijing Olympics in February after Russia was found to have been involved in a major doping scandal in the 2014 Olympics. And in 1980, when many nations boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, some athletes from the boycotting countries competed under neutral flags.', 'A top U.S. Olympic official this week endorsed considering “a pathway back” for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under a neutral flag. A group of high-ranking Olympic officials from around the world convened in Lausanne, Switzerland, last week to discuss the issue.', '“We agreed that there would now be an exploration and a consultation with stakeholders to see whether there could be a pathway for those individual athletes to come back as neutral,” said Susanne Lyons, the chair of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, according to Reuters.']"

The attack on Wednesday suggested that if there was such a glitch, it had been fixed.', 'Ukraine’s air defenses shot down all 13 of the Iranian-made Shahed drones — designed to dive into their targets and detonate on contact — that were launched at Kyiv and the surrounding region, officials said. There were no reports of casualties, but falling debris damaged two government buildings and at least four houses, they said.', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine praised the air-defense systems in a brief video message published on the Telegram messaging app. “Well done! I’m proud!” Mr. Zelensky said. “We thank the Air Defense Forces!”', 'Compared to missiles, drones are much slower and easier to shoot down. They carry smaller warheads, often have shorter ranges and are less precise, but there has been speculation that Russia is running low on precision-guided missiles. Drones are also far cheaper, allowing an army to fire them by the dozens or even the hundreds, overwhelming air defenses and allowing some to reach their targets.', 'How long Russian can sustain firing salvos of drones remains unclear. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s chief of military intelligence, said in October that Russia had ordered about 1,700 drones of all types from Iran and had used more than 300 of them, but it was not clear how fast they were being delivered.', '“Shahed terror may actually last for a while,” he said at the time in an interview with Ukrainian news media. But since then, Kyiv has not offered any update on the size of Russia’s arsenal.', 'On Wednesday, one of the drones shot down over Kyiv bore a message painted on its wing: “For Ryazan!!!” apparently a claim that the attack was revenge for Ukrainian strikes last week at air bases deep inside Russia, including one near Ryazan, south of Moscow, that reportedly killed three service members. Russian warplanes taking off from those bases have fired missiles into Ukraine.', 'After Russian forces in September began to lose ground they had seized early this year in eastern and southern Ukraine, they drastically increased missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, particularly the electrical grid, far behind the front lines. Millions of Ukrainians are living and working in subfreezing weather with intermittent power, heat and running water — or none at all — and in damaged buildings ripped open to the elements.', 'The United Nations and human rights groups have said repeatedly that such strikes on civilian targets can constitute a war crime.', 'The renewed drone strikes come amid rising concerns Russia could also acquire Iranian ballistic missiles. Ukraine now has no defenses against such missiles. The United States is expected as early as this week to announce a transfer to Ukraine of Patriot air-defense missiles, which are designed to shoot down missiles, which would be the most sophisticated weapon provided to Ukraine over 10 months of war.', 'The Biden administration has been reluctant to provide the most advanced arms to Ukraine, especially those that could be used to strike far into Russia, fearing anything that could cause the war to escalate into direct confrontation with Moscow. Ukraine’s recent attacks on air bases some 300 miles beyond its borders were carried out using Soviet-era reconnaissance drones, possibly repurposed with warheads, military analysts have suggested.', 'The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Wednesday that Russia would “undoubtedly” target any Patriot missile batteries in Ukraine. But Moscow has made similar statements about other sophisticated weapons supplied to Ukraine, like the highly effective HIMARS rocket artillery, warning repeatedly that it saw their arrival as escalations.', 'In addition to weapons, the United States and its allies have provided humanitarian aid and financial backing to Ukraine, and in recent days have focused on efforts to rebuild critical infrastructure. The European Parliament on Wednesday approved a $19 billion loan package.', 'Pope Francis on Wednesday suggested that people celebrate “a more humble Christmas” this year by spending less on gifts and celebrations and sending the difference to Ukrainians in need.', 'In justifying striking Ukrainian civilian targets, Russia has stirred dark themes of revenge that do not fit the real timeline of the war. President Vladimir V. Putin said last week that Moscow’s attacks were retaliation for an explosion in October that damaged the Kerch Strait bridge, a symbolically and strategically important span tying Russian-occupied Crimea to Russian territory. But there have been Russian assaults on civilian targets throughout the war, and the wave of strikes on Ukrainian power plants began in September.', 'The words painted on a Russian drone on Wednesday continued in that vein. And a message visible from satellites was written recently on the runway of Russia’s Engels air base, used by bombers that launch cruise missiles at Ukraine, saying, “Death to Nazis,” an apparent response to a Ukrainian drone strike there on Dec. 5.', 'The Ukrainian government does not publicly acknowledge attacks inside Russia under a policy of intentional ambiguity. But it has been open about developing long-range drones, and Ukrainians have cheered such attacks as payback.', 'But a former defense minister, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, dismissed the idea of Russian attacks as retaliation, in part because of the asymmetry between Ukrainian strikes on targets that are overtly military or have direct military value, and Russia’s assaults on targets that do not and are meant only to degrade civilian life. And no matter what Ukraine does, he said, its leaders believe that Mr. Putin will continue the war regardless.', 'If Ukraine hit the Russian air bases, he said — insisting that he could not say whether it had or not — the goal was to chip away at Russia’s capacity to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine.', 'When small, Iranian-made exploding drones first appeared on Ukrainian battlefields in August, it was their first known use outside the Middle East. Russia has since fired flurries at Ukrainian cities and the country’s electrical grid and power stations, but paused such attacks in November, as winter weather set in. With little information on the rate of delivery from Iran, there have been questions about whether Russia’s supply of drones had run low.', 'The Institute for the Study of War, a United States-based research group, on Dec. 7 cited comments by Ukrainian officials suggesting that the drones — made for a warmer, arid climate — had been susceptible to the damp, freezing conditions in Ukraine, but that Russian engineers had resolved the problem.', 'A salvo of Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones fired over the weekend at Odesa was the first in three weeks to hit Ukraine. But some uncertainty about the weapon’s compatibility with colder weather lingered. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern military command, noted on Sunday that the flurry had coincided with above-freezing weather.', '“The Russians tried to adjust them to the weather conditions,” she said. Ms. Humeniuk said the drones were vulnerable to the formation of ice on their wings or flight-control surfaces. “They were most concerned about aerodynamics, the possibility of icing in case of temperature changes,” she said.', 'But in Kyiv on Wednesday, it was 23 degrees Fahrenheit, well below freezing, when the sun rose in a partly overcast sky.', 'The lull in drone waves also prompted military analysts to raise questions about whether Russia might be running low. Mr. Budanov, the military intelligence chief, said in October that some of those ordered from Iran had not yet been manufactured.', 'The war in Ukraine has been a sort of beta test for aerial drone combat, carefully watched by militaries and developers around the world. The Shahed-136, with an 80-pound warhead, can be fired in swarms from a flatbed truck. It is among dozens of types of drones being used in Ukraine.', 'The United States has supplied Ukraine with its Switchblade drones that, like the Shahed, are essentially flying bombs that self-destruct. Ukraine has also deployed Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones that fire guided missiles. Russia has lagged for years in drone development and does not have a domestically produced long-range strike drone.', 'The drones aimed at Kyiv on Wednesday were launched from the Sea of Azov, more than 350 miles to the southeast, Ukrainian officials said.', 'The first sound that Yaroslav Vinokurov, 24, heard shortly before 6 a.m. was the wailing of the air-raid alarm in the darkness. He continued to get ready for work, given that alarms sound in Kyiv nearly every day. But soon machine-gun fire echoed through the Shevchenkivskyi district as air-defense systems flashed in the sky, followed by what he described as “a very loud explosion.”', '“I lay down on the floor, as I didn’t know what else can happen,” Mr. Vinokurov said. Only once it was quiet did he go outside.', 'The roof of a nearby government building was damaged, and debris littered the area. “My car is destroyed,” he said, surveying the scene.', 'Residents rushed to put sheets, blankets and whatever else they could find over shattered windows to protect themselves from the bitter cold.']"

But a few made their own announcements.', 'Mr. Macron committed 76.5 million euros, more than $81 million, in immediate assistance from France, in addition to €48.5 million already pledged. The Swiss Parliament approved the immediate disbursal of 100 million Swiss Francs, about $107 million, said President Ignazio Cassis of Switzerland. Canada committed 115 million Canadian dollars, around $85 million, specifically for Ukraine’s energy grid.', 'Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg pledged €4 million in immediate aid, noting that while Europeans worry about lowering thermostats by a degree or two in response to the war-induced energy crunch, there are Ukrainians living in bombed-out shells of buildings. “I’m not the biggest at the table,” he said. “But you can count on us. We are with you.”', 'Catherine Colonna, the French foreign minister, said more than $440 million of the aid would be allocated to power system repairs, with smaller amounts earmarked for other needs.', '“Thanks to things like today’s conference, we will have more and more partners supporting us,” said Mr. Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister. “We see how alone the aggressor stands.”', 'Though some might question the wisdom of rebuilding shattered infrastructure even as Russian missiles continue to fall, Mr. Zelensky reminded everyone that millions of Ukrainians continue to live and work in the country — in broken hospitals, homes, shops, schools and offices, often using generators — even as the bombs fall. Ukraine’s military has also recaptured dozens of cities and towns that had been occupied by the Russians, often finding them devastated.', '“Each time a territory is liberated by Ukraine, we need to rebuild it as soon as possible,” Mr. Macron said.', 'But such donations are just a small fraction of what will be needed to rebuild Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have called for a three-phase plan, starting with the kind of short-term infrastructure repairs addressed on Tuesday.', 'A second phase would focus on durably rebuilding thousands of damaged apartment buildings, homes, roads, schools and other structures, after the war. The third would focus further out on modernizing Ukraine’s major export-oriented industries, from agriculture to steel, in accordance with European standards, as the country prepares for hoped-for membership in the European Union.', 'Kyiv has said the effort would require at least $750 billion in investments, while the World Bank has put the reconstruction estimate at closer to $349 billion.', 'Either way, the sum is staggering, and the prospect of an avalanche of contracts has governments and hundreds of international companies rushing to help Ukraine now, in hopes of renewed deals when longer-term rebuilding starts in earnest. Companies from the United States, Germany, Denmark, Poland and beyond are already flocking to position themselves for rebuilding work.', 'France is no exception: After the morning multilateral meeting, Ukrainian ministers spent the afternoon with representatives of about 700 French companies to discuss rebuilding in the areas of infrastructure, energy, agriculture, digital innovation and health.', 'France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said that contracts worth 100 million euros to rebuild bridges, pave roads with cement and seed Ukrainian farms had been awarded at the conference Tuesday to three French companies, adding that those deals were just the tip of the iceberg. In a reflection of the risks involved, however, France and other governments plan to offer state guarantees to companies doing future work in Ukraine.', 'For Mr. Macron, the long-planned event offered an opportunity to demonstrate European leadership in supporting Ukraine and to assuage any tensions with the Ukrainian government. Officials in Kyiv have been wary of the French president’s insistence on continued dialogue with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and were irked by Mr. Macron’s recent statement that an “essential point” in any peace talks should be how to provide security guarantees to Mr. Putin’s Russia.', 'On Tuesday, Mr. Macron said, “It’s up to Ukraine, the victim of his aggression, to decide the conditions of a just and enduring peace.”']"

Lukashenko of Belarus may be giving the impression of combat readiness in order to force Ukraine to divert troops from other fronts.', 'Mr. Lukashenko is a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and Belarus relies on Moscow for finance, fuel and security assistance. Moscow used eastern Belarus as a staging ground when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. The United States and European governments have imposed sanctions on both countries.', 'A Belarusian Defense Ministry statement said that “a sudden check of combat readiness has begun” on the orders of Mr. Lukashenko.', 'As part of its preparations, Belarus’s troops will have to move to predetermined locations and test their equipment, organize security and defense and build bridges across the Neman and Berezina rivers, the Defense Ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.', 'The Neman river runs through Lithuania and eventually drains into the Baltic Sea, while the Berezina joins the Dnipro River around 40 miles north of the Ukrainian border. The exercises would not directly approach the frontier between Belarus and Ukraine, which is around 670 miles long.', 'In October, Mr. Lukashenko said that Russian troops would return to his country in large numbers, and in recent weeks drones have been launched from Belarus against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and other targets. In addition, supplies of military equipment have been ferried by Russian forces from Belarus to their troops in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.', 'Ukrainian forces are already fighting in the south and east. In light of the potential threat from the north, Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman of Ukraine’s State Border Guard Service, said on Tuesday that the country was strengthening its defenses along the length of its border with Belarus. He said the situation is under control.', '“We can clearly see how Russia is putting pressure on Belarus to join the full-scale war,” he said on a Ukrainian telethon.', 'Ukraine in recent weeks began to build a wall and trench system along the frontier in the northwestern province of Volyn, though analysts say that it is more likely to stop migrants crossing rather than for a military purpose.', 'The Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said in a report this week that Belarus is “extraordinarily unlikely to invade Ukraine in the foreseeable future.”', 'Instead, it said that Mr. Lukashenko and other officials in Belarus have assisted with an effort by Moscow to suggest that Belarus will join the war directly in an effort to pin down Ukrainian troops on their northern border.', 'At the same time, the Institute said that Moscow aimed to bind Belarus further into its campaign in Ukraine “as part of a long-term effort to cement further control over Belarus.”']"

Fighters Amid U.S. Sanctions,"The U.S. State Department says it knows of apparent ties between Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen strongman, and mixed martial arts fighters.","['As the war in Ukraine heads into winter, Ramzan Kadyrov, one of the closest allies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is gaining more visibility and propagandist fodder through his connections with Ultimate Fighting Championship fighters and others in mixed martial arts.', 'And although the U.F.C. as a company has repeatedly said its business has no connections to Kadyrov and that it follows all laws, government officials in the United States say they are aware of the apparent ties between U.F.C. athletes and Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya who faces severe legal restrictions.', 'Kadyrov has supplied soldiers to support the Russian forces fighting in Ukraine and has been one of the most hawkish cheerleaders of the invasion, at one point calling on Putin to use a low-yield nuclear weapon against Ukraine. Kadyrov also owns several businesses tied to mixed martial arts that have been restricted by the Treasury Department for U.S. citizens and others looking to do business in the United States. The businesses include Akhmat MMA, a gym that trains and sponsors fighters, and the restrictions also keep people from doing business with Kadyrov.', 'Still, the main event for U.F.C. 282 on Saturday featured Magomed Ankalaev, who has been sponsored by Akhmat for nearly his whole career, competing for the light heavyweight championship.', 'Neither Ankalaev nor his opponent took the belt after a rare split draw. Still, the bout was the latest in a string of recent moments that have linked U.F.C. personalities with Kadyrov and people in his orbit.', 'Last month, three former U.F.C. champions visited Chechnya at the behest of Kadyrov, who was first rebuked with Treasury sanctions in 2017 and accused of a wide range of human rights abuses, including kidnapping, torturing and killing L.G.B.T.Q. people in Chechnya. Kadyrov was given additional sanctions related to the war in September, as were his wives and adult children.', 'The former U.F.C. welterweight champion Kamaru Usman, the former flyweight champion Henry Cejudo, and the former interim lightweight champion Justin Gaethje were pictured in November testing out grenade launchers and assault rifles at the Russian Special Forces University in Chechnya. The facility is used to train Russia’s special forces units, including those participating in the war.', 'Usman, Gaethje and Cejudo also attended a birthday party for one of Kadyrov’s teenage sons. For Usman, it was the third time he had visited Chechnya since 2020, and the second time since the Treasury Department imposed sanctions directly on Kadyrov’s M.M.A. businesses.', 'Some Chechen mixed martial arts fighters, like the breakout U.F.C. star Khamzat Chimaev, also have extensive ties to Kadyrov.', 'Ali Abdelaziz, an agent who represents Usman, Gaethje, Cejudo and Ankalaev, among many other fighters, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Neither did an agent for Chimaev.', 'On Twitter on Sunday, Gaethje said he had never met Kadyrov but acknowledged his trip to Chechnya. “Went for the kids birthday party,” he said. “I also like to shoot guns.”', 'The sanctions, which are broad, are generally designed to discourage people from taking actions that will benefit those facing restrictions financially or in other ways. Simple interactions could be subject to harsh penalties.', 'A State Department official familiar with the investigations of Kadyrov’s business dealings said in a statement: “The Department of State is aware of Kadyrov’s association with Chechen U.F.C. fighters.” The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the application of the Treasury sanctions and shared the statement on the condition of anonymity. Although the State Department had previously noted Kadyrov’s ties within combat sports, the statement is its first direct mention of athletes with the U.F.C. having ties to Kadyrov.', 'In October at U.F.C. 280, which was held in the United Arab Emirates, Chimaev sat cageside along with two of Kadyrov’s teenage sons, who are minors and not among Kadyrov’s children who have been named in the sanctions. Chimaev and one of the boys, who is 14, posed for a photo with Dana White, the U.F.C. president. The photo later appeared on an Instagram account associated with Kadyrov, who has long used similar photographs to burnish his reputation.', 'In a statement, the U.F.C. said it had “no contractual relationship or any commercial dealings with Ramzan Kadyrov” or anybody affiliated with him. It added that the more than 600 fighters from more 70 different countries were independent contractors, “who have control over many aspects of their careers, including where they train or where they live when not competing.”', 'The U.F.C. has at times told fighters not to work or be affiliated with certain people or businesses. Recently, the U.F.C. barred fighters from working with a gym and a coach because of investigations in at least two U.S. states and in Canada of suspicious betting patterns.', 'Shahroo Yazdani, a lawyer at the Washington-based firm Price Benowitz who specializes in Treasury sanctions, noted that a news release announcing the latest sanctions against Kadyrov specifically mentioned his association with mixed martial arts, and how he has recruited fighters for the war in Ukraine through his M.M.A. clubs.', '“With that specifically noted in the designation, it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens with his M.M.A. associates,” Yazdani said. “We may well see more fighters stopped at airports and potentially even more designations related to those working with his M.M.A. club.”', 'After U.F.C. 280, Chimaev scuffled with a fighter who is the cousin of the former U.F.C. lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. Kadyrov later posted a screenshot on Instagram of a video call with both fighters and proclaimed that he had resolved the “misunderstanding” between them.', '“I have made sure of it personally,” Kadyrov said in the caption on his post.', 'Abuzayed Vismuradov, a colonel for Kadyrov’s militia who is considered to be one of the most powerful men in Chechnya and who operates Akhmat MMA, posted a video on Instagram with the fighters showing that the conflict had been resolved.', 'Also in the video was the retired champion Nurmagomedov, as well as Islam Makhachev — who had captured the lightweight title at U.F.C. 280. In front of the men, a U.F.C. belt was propped up on a table.', '“The dogs bark, the caravan moves on,” Vismuradov said in a caption in the video in which he also praised Kadyrov directly and closed with the battle slogan for Kadyrov loyalists: “Akhmat Power.”', 'In 2019, Vismuradov received sanctions from the U.S. Treasury Department, which said that he “was in charge of an operation that illegally detained and tortured individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived LGBTI status.”', 'Chimaev, a Chechen-born Swedish resident who trains at Allstars Training Center in Stockholm, has maintained a well-publicized relationship with Kadyrov since joining the U.F.C. in 2020. On Sunday, Chimaev posted a video on Instagram of a training montage alongside Kadyrov’s teenage sons and members of his Allstars team in Dubai. The video was reposted by the account affiliated with Kadyrov, and both were captioned with the “Akhmat Power” slogan.', 'Chimaev’s two most recent fights have taken place in the United States, and Ankalaev appeared to have been in the country for more than a month ahead of his bout on Saturday. However, some Akhmat MMA fighters have struggled to secure U.S. visas in the past few months, a potential sign of difficulties the U.F.C. could face if the U.S. government increases its pressure.', 'Maxim Grishin, a Russian-born Akhmat MMA fighter, was scheduled to fight in Las Vegas on Nov. 5, but his bout was abruptly canceled just days ahead of the bout. Grishin said in an interview with a Russian news outlet that he struggled to secure a visa.', 'Grishin said he didn’t believe his affiliation with Kadyrov led to his travel difficulties, but also revealed that he was advised not to publicize their friendly relationship.', '“I was told that it is better not to associate myself with the Akhmat Fight Club, which I am a representative of,” Grishin told Match TV in an interview that was also picked up by Russia Today, the country’s state-controlled English-language news outlet. “But this is not just a contract, we have brotherly relations. I considered it cowardly. Sport is separate from politics, why should I hide something? I don’t do anything bad to the universe, why should the universe do bad things to me?”', 'The U.F.C. declined to answer questions about Grishin. When asked about denials of visas to Russian nationals, a State Department spokesperson said that visa records were confidential and that by law it could not provide details about individual visas.', 'In September, the State Department announced visa restrictions against 910 Russians in response to the invasion of Ukraine, as well as sanctions against other key Russian officials.', '“We will hold to account any individual, entity, or country that provides political or economic support for Russia’s illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in the announcement.']"

With the war going poorly for Russia, that could have been awkward.","['It has been an annual ritual of Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia: The president holds a wide-ranging, marathon news conference in December, making a somewhat choreographed show of openness to questioning and demonstrating his command of an array of topics.', 'But after a series of military setbacks in his war in Ukraine, with Russia’s casualties mounting and its economy faltering under sanctions, Mr. Putin has decided to skip the tradition. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, did not offer a reason when he told reporters during a daily briefing on Monday that the event would not take place this month; he held out the possibility that it might be rescheduled for the new year.', 'Mr. Putin first held the year-end news conference in 2001, two years into his presidency. He suspended the practice after becoming prime minister in 2008, but resumed it after returning to the presidency in 2012. The last time he opted out of the event, as president, was in 2005.', 'Often stretching to four hours or more, the December news conference has been one of the few times during the year when reporters outside the Kremlin pool, including foreign correspondents, get the chance to directly question Mr. Putin — if they are called on. But the Kremlin has also asked reporters ahead of time what they might be inclined to ask Mr. Putin.', 'The ranks of journalists in Russia who are not subservient to the government are thinner than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union, and this year the government criminalized criticism of the war or the military. Independent Russian news media have all either shut down or moved abroad, and many foreign news outlets have been forced out of the country as well.', 'Even so, it would have been possible for either a Russian or an international reporter to detail some of the setbacks in Ukraine and to ask Mr. Putin embarrassing questions about them — live on national television.', 'Mr. Peskov noted that Mr. Putin “regularly speaks to the press, including on foreign visits,” but such exchanges are limited to the pool of reporters regularly assigned to the Kremlin.', 'Political analysts had various reactions, from suggesting Mr. Putin had no future vision to offer, to the idea that he was finding some of his customs monotonous. One of them, Tatiana Stanovaya, wrote on her Telegram channel that the cancellation was a sign Mr. Putin did not want to engage with what he considered to be minor domestic matters or to answer boring or routine questions.', 'Mikhail Vinogradov, the political scientist who heads the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, said the move contributed to a general sense of stagnation in the country. Even though a lot is happening, he said, calling off the event captures the feeling that “the situation on pause.”', 'The invasion that Mr. Putin ordered in February has left Russia increasingly isolated, economically and politically, as Western nations and others have rallied around Ukraine, showing a rare unity of purpose that they demonstrated again with a series of diplomatic moves on Monday.', 'Leaders of the Group of 7 wealthy democracies held a video meeting and vowed to help rebuild Ukraine, which has suffered widespread physical devastation, as well as continue to arm it. They said a new body to coordinate international economic and reconstruction aid — akin to the one operating for months to organize military aid — could meet for the first time as soon as January. A broader international conference on aid for Ukraine will be held in Paris on Tuesday.', '“We firmly support efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial stability and its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous and democratic future,” the G7 nations said in a joint statement.', 'Addressing the meeting by video link, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine focused primarily on his country’s need for more weaponry, but also said, “We must be more active with reconstruction.”', 'European Union foreign ministers held a separate meeting on Monday and agreed to increase a fund reimbursing countries for war matériel provided to Ukraine to 5.5 billion euros (nearly $5.8 billion) from 3.5 billion euros.', 'Russian bombardment has crippled Ukraine’s energy systems, knocking out power, heat and sometimes water to millions of people at a time, raising fears of a cold, deadly winter.', 'Military analysts say the increasingly harsh weather could also allow the warring armies to return to more intense frontline combat. The autumn rains reduced dirt roads and fields to bogs, slowing military movement, but the ground is freezing solid again.', 'The most intense fighting has been in the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine claimed to have struck a blow against the Wagner Group, the mercenary corps headed by Yevgheny V. Prigozhin, a close ally of Mr. Putin’s, which has operated in concert with the Russian military. Ukrainian officials said that on Sunday, their forces had fired a missile that hit a hotel housing Wagner fighters in Kadiivka, a small city in Luhansk Province.', 'The exiled head of the Ukrainian regional administration in Luhansk Province, Serhiy Haidai, said in a post on the Telegram app that “many” members of the Wagner force had been killed, which could not be confirmed. There was no statement from Wagner.', 'Mr. Putin has tried to present life in Russia as business as usual for most people, an image that has become harder to maintain. Thousands of troops have been killed or wounded, which generally goes unmentioned in state media. A mismanaged call-up of about 300,000 military conscripts this fall prompted demonstrations and spurred thousands of men to flee the country; Ukrainian officials predict that another Russian draft is coming soon.', 'A news conference could expose Mr. Putin to questions about casualties, conscription or specific battlefield setbacks like the strike against Wagner or the retreat from the captured city of Kherson. He continues to insist that the war in Ukraine is going according to plan.', 'Mr. Putin’s annual news conference usually unrolls in a circuslike atmosphere, with reporters waving signs containing some of the Russian leader’s signature phrases, or wearing costumes from their native regions, in the hope of catching his eye and getting to ask a question. The sessions are a set piece on his calendar, a chance for Mr. Putin to display his command of the facts affecting all aspects of Russian life, and ostensibly, to show him as being receptive to all queries.', 'Mr. Putin prefers scripted events, however, and in the past week he made several highly staged public appearances aimed at reinforcing his version of reality, at a time when a Russian victory in Ukraine appears as distant as ever. Those televised events presented Mr. Putin as a decisive leader, still fully in charge.']"

The warhead had been removed and ballast added to disguise the fact that it was not carrying a payload, said Gen. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy intelligence chief — an assertion now backed by the Pentagon and British military intelligence.', 'But that was not all the intelligence officials found. The missile had been built in a Ukrainian weapons factory.', 'The missile, and the bomber that most likely delivered it, was part of a cache of weaponry handed over to Russia by Ukraine in the 1990s as part of an international agreement aimed at assuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, General Skibitsky said.', 'In November, Ukrainian forces found the remnants of two more Kh-55 missiles, also with their warheads removed, and part of the same tranche of weapons that Ukraine had sent to Russia under the agreement.', 'Russia was using Ukraine’s own armaments as decoys against it. They served a strategic goal: Sending up the missiles would force Ukraine to mobilize its air-defense system against them.', '“First, the Kh-55 missile is launched; we react to it,” General Skibitsky said, speaking in a lengthy interview at military intelligence headquarters in Kyiv last week, before the latest missile strikes across the country. “It’s like a false target.”', 'After the Ukrainian air defenses are engaged, he said, Russian bombers launch the more modern missiles, with destructive warheads.', 'The three missiles are part of a larger number of retrofitted older missiles used in strikes, some as decoys and some modernized with warheads.', 'The use of old cruise missiles — including ones built in Ukraine decades ago — is just one element in a complex and deadly conflict in which deception plays a role, along with fighting on the battleground.', 'As part of the 1990s agreement, known as the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arsenal — the world’s third-largest at the time, inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union — and transfer all nuclear warheads to Russia for decommissioning in return for security assurances.', '“All ballistic missiles, Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic bombers were also handed over,” said General Skibitsky. “Now, they are using Kh-55 missiles against us with these bombers. It would be better if we handed them over to the U.S.A.”', 'The general also offered a detailed assessment of current Russian capabilities and Ukraine’s ability to counter the threat.', 'His account corresponds generally with public statements from other Ukrainian military officials, the British Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon and military analysts.', '“According to our calculations, they have missiles for another three to five waves of attacks,” he said. “This is if there are 80 to 90 rockets in one wave.”', 'Last Monday, Russia fired more than 70 missiles at Ukraine after Ukraine struck two military installations deep inside Russia.', 'While Russia’s stockpiles of its most modern, precision missiles are widely believed to be running low, General Skibitsky said that Russian arms factories had been able to build 240 precision Kh-101 cruise missiles and about 120 of the sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles since the start of the war, which works out to about 40 new missiles per month. Those numbers could not be independently confirmed.', 'Despite Western sanctions, Russia has continued to produce new precision missiles, as recently as October, according to a report released last week by Conflict Armament Research, an independent group based in Britain that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition used in wars.', 'Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force, said that after the latest assault, investigators found many fragments that indicated the precision cruise missiles used in the attack had been made in recent weeks.', '“Russia is using newly manufactured missiles,” he told Ukrainian radio on Thursday.', 'As the Russians seek to bolster their arsenal, Ukrainian officials say they are getting better at shooting down many types of missiles and drones fired their way.', 'Over the course of November, Brig. Gen. Oleksiy Hromov, a deputy chief on the Ukrainian General Staff, said that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 percent of the 239 Russian cruise missiles and 80 percent of the 80 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones.

But they do not enter Ukrainian air space, limiting their effectiveness.', 'Typically, Ukrainian intelligence has about an hour after Russian bombers take off from a base to track the flights before pilots reach the “fire zone” and launch missiles.']"

Shor, a convicted fraudster and fugitive who, officials say, is working to turn an energy crisis into a political crisis that threatens the government.', 'Anger at high energy prices has been bubbling across Europe for months, offering Moscow what it sees as its best hope of eroding public support for Ukraine and pressuring Western governments to back away from their condemnations of Russia’s invasion.', 'Russia-friendly activists on the far left and far right have helped mobilize protests over high energy prices in the Czech Republic, Germany and other European countries. But those demonstrations have been less frequent and far less well-funded than the weekly rallies and often daily flash mob protests in Moldova, a country that is particularly vulnerable because of its longstanding political, economic and linguistic cleavages.', ' Russia has not only created public discontent in Moldova through a squeeze on energy supplies, but, working through local allies like Mr. Shor, has also pushed this discontent onto the streets, trying to unseat the pro-Western government.', '“It is obvious these things are all connected,” said Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu. The energy crisis, he added in an interview, is “very, very serious,” and “it is legitimate for a lot of people to feel unhappy.”', 'But he scorned Mr. Shor’s role in organizing and bankrolling protests as “an attempt to manipulate and ride the negative effects of the war in Ukraine.” The result, he said: An energy crunch engineered by Russia and exploited by groups that “openly support Russia” to “destabilize the government.”', 'A tiny but strategically important country sandwiched between Romania — a member of NATO and the European Union — and Ukraine, Moldova has been caught since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, of which it was a part, in an intense geopolitical tug of war between East and West.', 'Local politicians backed by either Moscow or Washington and the European Union have traded power in a long series of unstable governments in Chisinau. Mr. Shor’s party won just six of 101 seats in Parliament in elections last year, while Ms. Sandu’s party won a big majority over those seeking close relations with Moscow.', 'Russia’s February invasion of neighboring Ukraine pushed this perennial struggle into a tumultuous new phase.', 'It sent shock waves and, on at least two occasions, missiles crashing onto Moldovan territory. The missiles, the second of which was found on Monday, landed in northern Moldova near the border with Ukraine, further rattling a fragile country already grappling with inflation of nearly 35 percent. Gas prices in Moldova have increased sevenfold and electricity prices have increased fourfold in the past 12 months, Ms. Sandu, the country’s president, told CNN on Saturday.', 'Though not a direct party to the war, Moldova, whose Constitution commits it to neutrality, has felt Russia’s fury through sharp cuts in energy supplies.', '“Russia’s objective is clear,” said Andrei Spinu, a deputy prime minister in charge of Moldova’s frantic efforts to patch together alternative supplies of electricity and gas. “They want to change our government, and change our geopolitical choice toward Europe,” he said, sitting in a gloomy office in central Chisinau lit only by thin winter light coming through the windows.', 'All the lights in his office have been turned off to save electricity. He uses a cellphone flashlight to navigate the darkened corridors of the main government building. Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s power grid, which used to provide Moldova with a vital backup source of electricity, left the whole country without power late last month.

He finances the demonstrations and speaks by video link to each gathering chanting for Ms. Sandu’s removal.', 'Warning of a “tough winter” ahead without Russian gas, Mr. Shor recently used his Facebook page to call on supporters to “come out en masse” for street protests. “We must do everything we can to get rid of this incompetent government and hold early elections.”', 'He did not respond to requests for an interview through his spokesperson.', 'In October, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Shor, his Russian pop-star wife and seven others for involvement in “persistent malign influence campaigns” by Russia in Moldova.', 'That same month, the police conducted nighttime raids on 55 offices, vehicles and residences connected to him and his party. Investigators seized 20 black plastic shopping bags stuffed with local currency worth $89,000, which prosecutors say represented a week’s outlay on protests and other activities aimed at unseating the government.', '“A lot of effort and money has been put into destabilizing the situation in our country,” Veronica Dragalin, Moldova’s anticorruption prosecutor, said in an interview.', 'Many people, including American officials, suspect that some of the Shor Party’s cash comes from Russia, which would be illegal, but Mr. Shor has denied it. He has also appealed his 2017 conviction and seven-and a-half-year sentence over his role in the theft of nearly a billion dollars from Moldovan banks, insisting he is the victim of a corrupt justice system.', 'Paying people to protest is not illegal. But by amplifying genuine discontent it creates an impression that the country is falling apart — a message, analysts say, that has been promoted with glee by Russian news outlets.', 'Mr. Shor’s party also routinely exaggerates the size of its protests, claiming, for example, that 45,000 showed up last week outside the prosecutor general’s office. The real number was a few thousand.', 'The spectacle of a political party’s echoing Kremlin talking points on the war and organizing paid protests over an energy crisis generated by Russia illustrates one of Moscow’s favorite tactics for asserting its influence across the former Soviet Union: Stoke a crisis and then, either directly or through local proxies, offer a solution that requires acceptance of Russian hegemony.', 'The pattern first played out three decades ago when, just months after the collapse of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russian separatists in the Transnistria region of eastern Moldova took up arms against the government of the newly independent nation. Moscow vowed to quell the violence and sent in troops, allowing Transnistria to operate ever since as a quasi-state haven for Russian influence and black market trade.', 'The pattern repeated in 2014 in eastern Ukraine, where Russia stoked an armed rebellion against the central government in Kyiv, and then offered to help curb the mayhem provided that Ukraine accept terms entrenching Moscow’s influence. After that failed, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a full-scale invasion in February.', 'With Russian troops flailing in Ukraine, nobody expects the Kremlin to send its battered military into Moldova any time soon. A small Russian force remains in Transnistria, but most of the troops are ill-trained local recruits, and they are sorely underequipped. Ukraine closed its borders with Transnistria at the start of the war, severing supply lines.', 'Its military options limited, Moscow has instead hammered Moldova with its energy weapon, delivering less than half the natural gas stipulated in contracts.', 'Many supporters of Mr. Shor, the fugitive millionaire, in Orhei, where he served as mayor for four years before fleeing to Israel in 2019, acknowledge that he may be a crook.', 'But pointing to his tenure as mayor, when he built sidewalks, installed lights and improved Orhei markedly, they see him as a Robin Hood figure whose wealth, no matter its source, will bring benefits to ordinary people.', 'His other big selling point is that, unlike the current government, he has close ties with Russia and can use them to end the energy crunch.', 'Indeed, soon after Russia’s energy behemoth, Gazprom, began cutting gas deliveries to Moldova in the fall, a move that threatened a long, cold winter ahead, Mr. Shor criticized Ms. Sandu for “bowing to the West.” And he sent several of his party’s legislators to Moscow to find “solutions to provide the Republic of Moldova with natural gas this winter at affordable prices,” the party said in a statement.', 'Mr. Shor claimed that Russia would soon start providing cheap gas to the region around Orhei. That never happened, not least because delivering Russian gas only to Orhei is technically and legally impossible.', 'Thousands of protesters have, nonetheless, gathered every week since in support of his appeal for better relations with Russia.', 'Mr. Shor recently acknowledged paying protesters — after an independent Moldovan newspaper, Ziarul de Garda, published an investigation written by journalists who had posed as protesters and received money.', 'Mr. Verejanu, the mayor of Orhei, said no more than half the protesters were paid, and only those too poor to buy food and drink during the trip to and from Chisinau.', 'At a Shor Party rally last week outside the prosecutor general’s office, protesters blocked the main boulevard and denounced the president and government ministers as corrupt thieves blind to people’s economic pain.', 'Maria Muntiu, 80, insisted she had not been paid to attend and had come out because she wanted to express her anger at being unable to afford heating.', 'Moldova, she said, needs a “real president like Putin” who will put the country’s interests ahead of “geopolitical games by America” and provide cheap energy. Ms. Sandu, she said, “is trying to freeze us into silence.”']"

This would not be peace, but occupation.”', 'The other two laureates — Memorial, a Russian research and human rights organization, and Ales Bialiatski, a jailed Belarusian activist — have also become symbols of resistance and accountability during the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, set off by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.', 'Memorial is known for its efforts to uncover the crimes of the Soviet era, but Jan Rachinsky, its chairman, who accepted the award for Memorial, said that his organization does more than research and document the tragedies of the past, extending its efforts to the “acute social conflicts of the present.”', '“What we see as the root cause of these crimes is the sanctification of the Russian state as the supreme value,” he said in his speech. “This requires that the absolute priority of power is to serve the ‘interests of the state,’ over the interests of individual human beings, and their freedom, dignity and rights.”', 'This “inverted system of values,” he said, “prevailed in the Soviet Union for 70 years and, regrettably, continues until today.”', '“One of the obvious effects of the sanctification of the state was the rise of imperial ambitions,” he said. It also allows for “impunity, not only for those who make criminal political decisions, but also for those who commit crimes in the execution of those decisions.”', '“We saw this in the hostilities in Chechnya, and we see it happening again today in the occupied territory of Ukraine,” he said. “Regrettably, Russian society did not have the strength to break the tradition of state violence.”', 'In her acceptance speech, Ms. Matviychuk of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said the international system designed after World War II has been severely undermined, and called on world leaders to “stop pretending deferred military threats are ‘political compromises.’”', '“The democratic world has grown accustomed to making concessions to dictatorships,” she said. “And that is why the willingness of the Ukrainian people to resist Russian imperialism is so important.”', 'A desire for peace does not mean peace at any cost, she said, and her country cannot “leave people in the occupied territories to be killed and tortured.”', '“People’s lives cannot be a ‘political compromise,’” she said. “Fighting for peace does not mean yielding to pressure of the aggressor, it means protecting people from its cruelty.”', 'Before the ceremonies, which were held in Oslo, Russia launched more than a dozen Iranian-made attack drones in a predawn assault on targets in Ukraine’s south, knocking out power in the city of Odesa and the surrounding region.', 'In his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that the situation was “very difficult” in parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, with the fighting around Bakhmut particularly vicious.

He was detained in Belarus following protests in 2020 against the re-election of the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, and remains in jail without trial.

On Thursday, she was freed and sent back to the United States in a prisoner exchange for a notorious Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, in a move that some Republican politicians and analysts have said puts other Americans at risk of being wrongfully detained for political gain.', 'Ms. Griner’s detention has injected a complex new factor into the calculation of whether to travel to, or work in, Russia, an already fraught decision with the war in Ukraine as a backdrop.', 'More than 1,000 multinational companies have curtailed their operations in Russia since the invasion, with foreign managers often being the first to go. Most Western universities have halted student exchange programs with Russian peers. And most major European and American cultural institutions have ended collaborations with Russian theaters and museums, including the Bolshoi in Moscow and the Mariinsky in St. Petersburg, two of the world’s most storied houses for opera and ballet.', 'But in other areas the numbers of Westerners have held steady or even grown since Ms. Griner’s arrest.

Most famously, they include the actor Steven Seagal and the former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, who just this month took an oath of Russian citizenship.', 'Athletes have long provided one of the biggest streams of prominent Westerners to Russia.

Because Russia covets top-level “name” players, they often pay high salaries. Athletes can take in more than $1 million and often receive free housing and cars.', 'Mr. Neff, who represents about 30 professional basketball players, said Ms. Griner’s freedom did not lessen his caution in sending players to Russia during the conflict with Ukraine. He has discouraged his clients from going there and does not currently have any players in Russia.', '“I don’t think it changes anything,” Mr. Neff said of her release. “If you send someone to Russia, you know there are risks.

Rivers, 35, came to Russia in August, while Ms. Griner was on trial, to play for the team of Samara, a provincial capital more than 500 miles east of Moscow.', '“At this point I didn’t really have so many options coming my way,” Mr. Rivers said in an interview in September. “What’s the best thing for me right now, towards — I ain’t going to say the end of my career — but in my career at this point? Financially, what makes sense?”', 'The Russian basketball clubs are playing fewer games this season because of their suspension from Euroleague competition, a penalty that has diminished the quality of players the league has attracted, Mr. Neff said.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has only intensified the view in Poland that Germany’s close relations with Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin were not just naïve but selfish and, possibly, just on hold rather than permanently sundered.', 'Both sides have made mistakes in the current dispute, said Jana Puglierin, the Berlin director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The relationship has been deteriorating for years, but it’s peaking now and doing real damage,” she said. “There is a gap emerging between Europe’s east and west, old Europe and new Europe, and that’s beneficial only for Vladimir Putin.”', 'Germany thought this gesture of military help would be “an offer that was too good to be refused,” and would help convince Poles that Germany is a reliable ally, said a senior German diplomat, who would speak only anonymously in accordance with diplomatic practice. After all, he said, the Poles themselves are trying to buy Patriots, a surface-to-air, antimissile system, “so we wanted to make this government’s caricature of Germany more hollow.”', 'But after the Polish defense minister and president quickly accepted the offer, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful 73-year-old leader of Poland’s governing Law and Justice party, rejected it just two days later.', 'Not only did he insist that the Patriots go to Ukraine, but he suggested that Germany, which he regularly attacks as siding with Russia over Poland, and whose soldiers would be operating the Patriots, would not dare to confront Russia. “Germany’s attitude so far gives no reason to believe that they will decide to shoot at Russian missiles,” Mr. Kaczynski said.', 'Mr. Kaczynski has no formal role in the Polish government, but the defense minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, fell into line within hours. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, from the same party, and who is also Poland’s commander in chief, was embarrassed by the painfully obvious display of his powerlessness.', 'NATO allies were quietly furious, precisely because the Patriots would be operated by German soldiers and the defense bloc has made it clear that it will not deploy troops to Ukraine and risk a NATO-Russian war. Any decision to send Patriots to Ukraine, Germany said, would have to be a NATO decision, not a bilateral one.', '“Kaczynski knew this and was being totally cynical,” said Piotr Buras, the Warsaw director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Everyone knew the Germans would not and could not send Patriots to Ukraine. And, of course, there are no Polish soldiers in Ukraine, either.”', 'The only explanation for Mr. Kaczynski’s response is political, Mr. Baranowski of the German Marshall fund said, since Poland is in an electoral campaign and the party’s support has been slipping. With elections scheduled for next autumn, Law and Justice is reinforcing its base, and “criticism of Germany is a constant party line,” he said.', 'Some analysts detected a political motive on the German side as well. The offer by Berlin, so soon after the deaths of the Poles, was “clearly a German effort to have a win in the bitter, toxic Polish-German diplomatic war,” said Wojciech Przybylski, chief editor of Visegrad Insight and president of the Warsaw-based Res Publica Foundation, a research institution. “And it also harms Kaczynski’s electoral strategy.”', 'Even so, “for Poland’s leading politician, and head of the ruling coalition, to say that he has no trust in Germany as an ally was shocking,” Mr. Baranowski said. “If mismanaged this can hurt alliance unity, beyond the two countries — I’ve never seen security instrumentalized in this way, in this toxic mixture.”', 'But Germany decided to keep the offer open, the German diplomat said, and opinion polls showed that a large percentage of Poles thought that having German Patriots in Poland was a good idea.', 'On Tuesday night, the Polish government shifted its position again. Mr. Blaszczak, the defense minister, announced that after further talks with Berlin, he “disappointedly” accepted that the missiles would not go to Ukraine, adding, “We are beginning working arrangements on deploying the launchers in Poland and making them part of our command system.”', 'But the bitterness will persist, and few expect Mr. Kaczynski and his party to stop questioning German sincerity. Only in October, for instance, Warsaw suddenly demanded Germany pay reparations for World War II, calculating $1.3 trillion in wartime losses, an issue that Berlin said had been settled in 1990. ', 'But the criticism of German hesitancy toward helping Ukraine, and of France’s early willingness to push for peace talks at Ukraine’s expense, is not limited to Poland but is also prevalent in central, eastern and northern Europe, although less charged.', '“There is a lot of talk about Western and E.U. unity and cooperation on Ukraine, but at the same time this war has triggered a significant wave of criticism of Western Europe in Poland and the Baltics,” said Mr. Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It deepened the skepticism and criticism, especially of Germany and France, and fed a sense of moral superiority toward them, that we’re on the right side and they were on the wrong side,” he said. “And it has deepened mistrust about security cooperation with them, that we can’t rely on them, but only on the U.S. and the U.K.”', 'The Polish debate mixes two things, he said. First, there is a “ruthless political instrumentalization of Germany by Law and Justice — it’s incredible how they portray Germany as an enemy and Berlin as dangerous to Poland as Moscow, that Berlin wants Russia to win and is not really helping Ukraine at all.”', 'But beyond the crude propaganda, Mr. Buras said, there is a failure in Poland to recognize that there is a post-invasion realization in Berlin that war has come back to Europe, that Germany needs to rearm and has become far too dependent on Russian energy and Chinese trade.', 'Poland may not be the only country criticizing Germany over Ukraine, Ms. Puglierin said, but on another level, “it’s the political layer in Poland, toxic and nasty.” Law and Justice “jump on this German hesitation and use it for domestic political reasons, and I think it will only get worse before the elections, at the very time when unity is useful.”', 'There is one brighter spot of cooperation. Earlier this month, the two countries signed an agreement to work to ensure the future of the giant Schwedt refinery, a German facility that had processed Russian oil, now under sanctions.', 'Sophia Besch, a German analyst with the Carnegie Endowment, insisted that Germany had changed since the Russian invasion. She pointed to the sharp change in policy toward a stronger military and more economic resilience, the “Zeitenwende,” or historical turning point, announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “Scholz is much more committed to listening to Central European countries,” she said. “I believe our romance with Russia is over.”']"

Putin of Russia put forward a blunt thesis on the nature of truth.', '“You can’t trust anyone,” he told a reporter for Russian state media. “You can only trust me.”', 'It was a fitting coda to a week that saw Mr. Putin particularly busy in constructing his version of reality at a time when a Russian victory in Ukraine appears as distant as ever. In a marathon of public appearances that began on Monday with a televised drive across Russia’s damaged bridge to Crimea, Mr. Putin held forth on nuclear doctrine, prisoner swaps with the United States, supposed Polish revanchism and even the “very harsh” practices of European zoos.', 'On Wednesday, the Kremlin published nearly three hours of footage of Mr. Putin meeting with his “human rights council.” On Thursday, it released a video showing Mr. Putin pledging to continue his attacks on Ukraine while appearing so jovial, champagne flute in hand, that some observers thought he was drunk.', 'And in the Friday news conference on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kyrgyzstan, the president dismissed the notion that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might be facing headwinds.', '“The special military operation is taking its course, everything is stable for us there,” Mr. Putin said, using the Kremlin’s term for its war in Ukraine. “There are no issues or problems there today.”', 'Most of what Mr. Putin said repeated his past positions, and much of what he said was false. On Ukraine, he said that “in the end, we will have to reach a deal” to stop the war, even as he gave no hint of being prepared to respect Ukrainian sovereignty. And referring to Thursday’s release of the American basketball star Brittney Griner in return for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, Mr. Putin said that Russia “won’t say no to doing more of this work in the future.”', 'Yet his string of appearances was also a message in itself: that of a president who, despite an economy sagging under sanctions and Russia’s enormous military losses, is trying to portray himself as healthy, alert and still in charge.', 'The burst of activity has been a departure from November, when he held only one extended public event from Nov. 10 to 20 — an absence from the limelight that went unexplained by the Kremlin.', '“He is simply showing, mainly to Russia’s ruling circles, that he continues to be in control of the situation,” said Grigorii Golosov, a professor of political science at the European University at St. Petersburg. “When Putin speaks so much, what he is saying is not so important.”', 'Indeed, some of Mr. Putin’s commentary this week mainly served to reveal his fixation on his own government’s propaganda. At his Wednesday videoconference with a handpicked human rights panel, he responded to a question about the treatment of Russians in Europe by claiming that “nationalist elements in Poland” were “dreaming” of seizing parts of western Ukraine — repeating an unfounded claim that one of his top intelligence officials had made the week before.', 'He then went on a tangent about zoos: “In some Western countries animals in the zoo are killed in front of children, butchered and so on. This absolutely does not correspond to our culture, the culture of the peoples of the Russian Federation.”', 'It was a reference, pro-Kremlin media reported, to the decision by the Copenhagen Zoo in 2014 to kill a giraffe because of the risk of inbreeding. And it was an example of how Mr. Putin is trying to use whatever arguments he can to bolster anti-Western sentiment among the Russian public.', 'But in Mr. Putin’s autocracy, it is his own words that offer the best guide to Russian policy. On that score, he offered no hint of self-doubt this week, reprising the comparison he made last June of his own conquests to those of Peter the Great, the pivotal 18th-century czar.', '“The fact that there are new territories — this is a significant result for Russia, it’s serious,” Mr. Putin, flashing a self-satisfied smile, said at his videoconference Wednesday with his human rights council, despite his military’s increasingly tenuous grip on those regions.', '“Peter the Great was already fighting for access to the Azov Sea,” Mr. Putin added, referring to the southeastern Ukrainian coastline that Russian troops now control.', 'The next day, Mr. Putin awarded Russia’s Gold Star to military officers at the Kremlin. In addition to releasing footage of his speech, Mr. Putin’s office published a four-minute clip of the president making military small talk with the honorees, as each held a champagne flute.', '“The attack aircraft are fighting just great, as are the ‘sushki,’” Mr. Putin said, referring to the military’s Sukhoi warplanes with a diminutive. “Great, just excellent.”', 'He went on to justify Russia’s assaults on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with a “But who started it?” rhetorical question, claiming Ukraine was to blame because it had attacked the Kerch Strait Bridge to Crimea, which Russia uses to supply its frontline troops.', 'On social media, some expressed surprise that the Kremlin released the footage, given that Mr. Putin — whose sobriety and self-control are central to his carefully crafted image in Russia — looked like he may have been tipsy as he swayed back and forth. But Mr. Golosov said that broadcasting Mr. Putin seeming happy and relaxed as he discusses his country’s deadly war was effective for the Kremlin’s spin doctors.', '“Putin needs to show the public that everything is going well,” Mr. Golosov said, “that he is able to talk about what is going on with amusement.”', 'Still, Mr. Putin also has a global audience in mind. On Friday, he elaborated on what he said could be a shift in Russia’s nuclear doctrine, warning that Russia could amend its philosophy to allow for a pre-emptive strike. American policy, he said, might necessitate a more aggressive stance — even as he left his options open, as he usually does.', '“We’re just thinking about it,” Mr. Putin said.']"

Worse, the looted tiles were visible on the neighbor’s roof.', '“Friends are not friends anymore,” she said on a cold November day, her brown hair tucked in a beanie and her small frame wrapped in a winter coat. “The neighbors are not neighbors. Relatives — a part of them aren’t relatives anymore, because no one expected us to come back.”', 'Similar anxieties have been playing out among residents of the town, still mostly empty of people, ever since Ukrainian forces liberated it in September. The Russians’ arrival over the summer imposed a litmus test of sorts for Sviatohirsk and other tight-knit communities in Ukraine’s east, where the Russian church and Russian television had for years been promoting loyalty to Moscow.', 'As civilians who fled Sviatohirsk rejoin neighbors who stayed, residents say they now eye one another with suspicion. And as a cold winter sets in, the town remains divided — not by trench lines and artillery, but by where people’s allegiances lie: with Moscow or Kyiv.', 'Suspicions run so high that residents do not even agree which side, Russia or Ukraine, is responsible for shelling that struck various neighborhoods in the city, damaging houses and killing several dozen people.', '“No one is even letting it out — who he stands for and all that,” said one resident, an older man who declined to provide his name. He was sitting beside a warm steel stove at a makeshift coffee shop called Bouchée that serves as de facto neutral territory: a place where both pro-Ukrainians and pro-Russians can get a bite to eat undisturbed, as long as they keep to themselves.', 'The town’s freshly installed local government recognizes the problem and hopes that residents with pro-Russian sentiments will eventually embrace Kyiv, especially as conditions improve after living without power and basic services during the occupation.', '“The cellphone connection is working, the bread factory is working, the Ukrainian post office is working,” said Volodymyr Rybalkin, the head of the local military administration, who acts as a sort of interim mayor. “I think that even the people who knowingly stayed under occupation, waiting for the so-called ‘Russian world’ will sooner or later understand how much they were mistaken.”', 'But that conversion will not be easy.', 'Even before the war, the presence of the Monastery of the Caves — loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church and considered one of the church’s five holiest sites — gave the town a reputation for being pro-Russian. That perception was compounded by Sviatohirsk’s location in the Donbas, a predominantly Russian-speaking region where Moscow for decades promoted Soviet nostalgia politics. ', 'The propaganda, especially on television, has helped the Kremlin influence some Russian-speaking civilians in the east, even as it falsely depicts the region as essentially part of Russia and cites the supposed oppression of Russian speakers there as a justification for invading.', 'How Sviatohirsk will move on from its troubled interlude of occupation remains unclear. Around 650 people remain from a prewar population of about 4,000, according to local officials. Approximately 120 residents have returned since the Russian retreat.', 'Returnees like Myroslava believe that more people with pro-Ukrainian sensibilities will come back when the weather warms in the spring, diluting the local sentiment toward Russia.', '“They are already slowly starting to come back, because a lot of them can’t pay rent in other cities, and they return even if their house is destroyed,” said Myroslava, who returned to her home in October.

The tussle over the framework that will in large part be expected to carry out that restructuring has taken place below the surface, gaining far less public notice.', 'Any shift for Ukraine from a wartime to a peacetime economy promises to be fraught, pitting ideas for a strong central government that would target spending with a tighter hand against one with lighter-touch regulation in which free markets dominate. There are other tricky, though perhaps less prominent, transitions that would need to be simultaneously navigated.', 'Three decades have passed since Ukraine gained its independence, but the Soviet legacy lingers. It can be seen in the supply lines and transportation networks that were created when Kyiv and Moscow were part of a single nation. Ukraine was engineered and equipped with Soviet-era design, machinery and infrastructure that in many ways remain disconnected to Europe. For example, Ukraine’s railroad gauges are a different size from Europe’s, meaning trains can’t cross borders easily.', 'The lack of integration exists in sector after sector. Parts for everything from nuclear reactors to refrigerators previously supplied by Russia will need to come from elsewhere.', 'More challenging is the legacy of Ukraine’s flawed and incomplete transition to a modern, democratic market economy after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Parts of its commercial world have been plagued by corruption and cronyism. And Ukraine has yet to create the kind of resilient political institutions that undergird the standards of governance set by the European Union, which is likely to be its largest trading partner if the war is won.', 'This lack of an accountable, transparent and reliable public sector is at the core of much of the debate over what Ukraine should look like and who gets to make those decisions.', '“There is this idealistic view that the government can direct resources and people will listen,” said Yuriy Gorodnichenko, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “As somebody who grew up in Ukraine,” he added, “that’s not how it works.”', '“The government doesn’t have capacity to regulate,” he said. “It doesn’t have a professional, well-trained bureaucracy.”', 'Mr. Gorodnichenko contributed to reports on Ukraine’s reconstruction for the Center for Economic Policy Research in London, an independent network of economists.

He worries that the kind of hands-off, neoliberal approach that he argues has brought inequality, environmental degradation, and insufficient housing and medical care in the United States and other countries is being promoted as a model for Ukraine.', 'Ukraine is clearly in crisis mode, struggling to feed, house and warm the population through the winter while fighting a war. Survival is the priority. Postwar reconstruction is expected to take at least a decade. Still, Mr. Stiglitz said the decisions made today could shape what happened during that time.', 'Recent changes to labor laws approved by the Ukrainian Parliament have become a focal point of the differences. Mr. Stiglitz and other critics warn that worker protections are being dismantled, noting that employers are being given more leeway to set hours, change working conditions and lay off workers while weakening unions’ bargaining power.', 'Ukraine is undermining labor protections when the European Union is strengthening legal obligations to promote collective bargaining, said Luke Cooper, an economist at the London School of Economics. Military and economic success depend on buy-in from citizens, and that effort will be hampered if workers feel their protections are being weakened and wages lowered.', 'To supporters, though, the modifications were a much-needed overhaul of sclerotic and outdated Soviet-era rules. The old labor regulations, Mr. Gorodnichenko said, required employers to keep people on the payroll even if the entire factory had been destroyed or workers had left the country months earlier.', '“What we said in the report is not controversial in Ukraine at all,” he said. “The situation is so dire, something has to change.”', 'Tymofiy Mylovanov, a professor at the Kyiv School of Economics and a former government minister who also contributed to the center’s policy papers, said the push for deregulation was not caused by blind faith in a market economy, but rather worries that public institutions were not developed enough to handle the task.', 'He said that he agreed with Mr. Stiglitz’s general critique but that many of the on-the-ground problems facing Ukraine were far removed from the theoretical discussions about government control and market deregulation. Ukraine is a “transition economy” and “teenage democracy,” he said. Severance pay or a two-month advance notice for layoffs isn’t relevant when businesses have been destroyed and need to rebuild, Mr. Mylovanov said.', 'Incompetence and corruption plague both the private and the public sectors, Mr. Mylovanov acknowledged, and a balance must be struck to root it out. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine recently accused a property developer and former lawmaker of offering the mayor of Dnipro a 22 million-euro bribe to get the contract to build the city’s subway system.', '“The resilience of Ukraine’s economy will come from cooperation,” Mr. Mylovanov said, “from market institutions and state institutions working together.”', 'The scope of the task is mind-boggling. Ukraine has recently driven back Russian forces, but the pace and destructiveness of Russian attacks on civilians and infrastructure has picked up, with Moscow targeting power facilities, fuel depots and waterworks. Some cities have been nearly obliterated, and the path of devastation is wide and deep across the country, affecting factories, homes, offices, phone lines, hospitals, churches, warehouses, ports, railways and farmland.

Education, social and health services will need to be restored along with the physical infrastructure.', 'Estimates of the total cost have varied widely and are still being updated. Over the summer, Ukraine’s prime minister put the price of reconstruction at $750 billion. Every day that the war continues, that figure increases. Even if much of that cost is borne by other nations and global organizations, Ukraine is expected to rack up big debts and will need a healthy economy when the fighting ends for a sustained recovery.', '“You don’t achieve that without much heavier involvement of the private sector,” said Matteo Patrone, the managing director of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Kyiv.', 'The development bank, which has been providing Ukraine with hundreds of million of dollars in emergency loans, guarantees and donor grants, has a mandate to “foster the transition toward open market-oriented economies to promoted private and entrepreneurial initiative.”', 'Even so, Mr. Patrone remains optimistic. There is a broad consensus about overall aims: Ukraine must be transformed into a modern democratic state and market economy with a strong judiciary and strict safeguards.', 'The industrial base has been destroyed, but Ukraine is oriented toward Europe and is appealing to Western investment. It has an educated population and a competitive advantage when it comes to agribusiness. And, Mr. Patrone added, “Ukraine has strong and vibrant civil society.”']"

About 77,000 draftees were now engaged in fighting, he said.', '“In these conditions, the talk about some additional mobilization efforts makes no sense,” Putin said at a meeting with members of the Kremlin’s human rights council, a loyal group of journalists, activists and public figures. “There is no need for this for the state and for the Defense Ministry.”', 'Putin announced the end of the draft in October, although he did not issue an official order to stop it. That has prompted fears that the Kremlin may announce another wave at any moment as Russia suffers more battlefield setbacks.', 'Putin appeared to acknowledge that the war, now in its 10th month, was taking much longer that the Kremlin had expected. “As for the duration of the special military operation, of course, this might be a long process,” he said.', 'But he added that there was a “significant result” from territorial gains, referring to Russia’s illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions.

Days are measured not so much by time, but by volume.', 'Yesterday was quieter, the morning was loud, but the afternoon, when the Russians like to increase their shelling in the city’s south and east, will certainly be louder. So goes the thinking of many of Bakhmut’s remaining residents.', '“It’s louder than usual,” said Valeriy, a Bakhmut resident who declined to give his last name, as the crescendo of artillery reverberated off his apartment block on Tuesday. “But they’re shooting every day.”', 'In recent months, Russian forces have made Bakhmut one of the focal points in their quest to capture the eastern Donbas region. The city’s altered acoustics are one result of near-constant bombardment since the summer, and by far the most present: The thuds and blasts echo for miles.', 'With a pre-war population of around 70,000, Bakhmut once had a far different feeling, with children playing, tourists visiting the city’s renowned winery and walking paths bustling with residents.', 'On Tuesday, the sounds in the city center were howling dogs, sheared strips of damaged roofing clattering and a singing older woman, who was otherwise drowned out by the diesel engine of a Ukrainian tank lumbering toward the front line.', 'Beyond the ruined multistory buildings and the Soviet-wide roads, is the seemingly unending back and forth of artillery. Some people refer to it sarcastically as “rocket tennis.”', 'The shelling is background noise until it isn’t. Its seriousness is deciphered by determining distance, direction and volume.', 'Distant tapping: machine gun fire.', 'Loud bang nearby: outgoing mortar.', 'Muffled bang further away: outgoing howitzer.', 'Salvo of distant thuds: outgoing rockets.', 'Whistle overhead: artillery shell in flight.', 'Loud whistle followed by loud crump: incoming fire.', 'Ear-shattering blast that breaks windows and sets off car alarms: Run to the basement, throw yourself to the ground, do whatever it takes to live.', 'Further outside Bakhmut, the sounds merge together. In the distant hills, sharp crack of Ukrainian artillery break through the thuds in the city.', 'Irina, a retired nurse with a home on Bakhmut’s outskirts, stood in her living room as artillery rattled the windows and the door.', '“Those are our boys firing,” she exclaimed. “God protect them.”']"

Then Russia invaded Ukraine, and recast art in a hard new light.","['For me the year in culture can be divided into two eras: before Feb. 24, after Feb. 24.', 'Before, I felt pretty certain nothing would command my attention like “Jacques-Louis David: Radical Draftsman,” the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s icy, cerebral, unrelentingly rigorous exhibition of drawings from the years around the French Revolution. No one had ever staged a full-scale show of David’s works on paper, and this one offered an unusual vista of an artist whose grand paintings put reason before passion, and ideals before blood relations. In four drawings for his “Death of Socrates,” finished in 1787, we saw the philosopher prepare to drink the lethal cocktail rather than repudiate his beliefs. Eight sketches for his “Brutus,” leading right up to 1789, showed the Roman consul refusing to mourn his traitorous sons as their corpses are hauled away.', 'My feelings for this greatest of Neoclassical artists, who spun Roman precedents into propaganda for the Reign of Terror and then for Napoleon, have cycled over many years between adulation and queasiness. In front of these drawings at the Met, I fell in love with David again: with his intensity and his frigidity; with how, in his shadow, today’s “political” art looks as benign as patty-cake. Here were the slow, accretive processes of someone ready to die, or indeed to kill, for a vision of civic virtue.', 'And then, a week after the Met show opened: Feb. 24. I couldn’t turn off the livestreams of the Kyiv night sky, lit up with white flashes, deranged by baying sirens and crackling shells. I watched, from the secure distance of my phone, as refugees streamed westward and those who stayed went underground. Later I went in person, to see what had been destroyed and who was fighting back. Why does culture matter, to a person, to a nation? In Paris, in Kyiv? In 1789, in 2022? Because, in times of great upheaval, you need exemplars to look toward. Because, when you might lose everything, you must sum up what should never be forgotten.', 'An invasion is not a revolution. The young artists caught up in Europe’s largest conflagration since World War II are working amid a campaign of terror; David, by 1791, would become a terroriste himself. Nevertheless, when culture took on the dimensions of survival, Ukraine’s artists have done what I thought could no longer be done: They have met history head-on. Their work is not the work of victims. It is the work of combatants — of active participants in an explicit culture war, proving every day that civic values can help defeat a supposedly superior adversary.', '“We don’t always have sufficient resources to speak to this evil and be treated as equals,” the viper-tongued poet and novelist Serhiy Zhadan writes in “Sky Above Kharkiv,” his forthcoming book that chronicles life in the city as cluster munitions have rained down on civilians. “Yet our language has turned out to be much stronger than any attempt to compel us to remain silent, to forgo calling a spade a spade, or to forgo pronouncing the names we use to identify each other. We are trying to stand up to death; we are trying to stand up to absolute silence.”', 'In war zones or in exile, on a bunker-cast for a few dozen viewers or in front of tens of thousands at the Brandenburg Gate, Ukraine’s writers, filmmakers, painters and world-beating DJs have fought their battles every bit as formidably as their army has fought theirs. In the nearly empty Odesa Fine Arts Museum stands a full-body cast of the Crimean-born Maria Kulikovska, made of the gelatin that mimics human tissue in ballistic testing, with flowers pressed into the substitute flesh. Vic Bakin, one of Kyiv’s most compelling young photographers, shifted from his moody, black-and-white portraits of ravers and models to stark, full-color reportage from Bucha and Irpin. Ukrainian literature retains a documentary impulse that runs rings around our self-centered autofiction; Artem Chekh, the soldier-author of “Absolute Zero,” volunteered for the armed forces again, and kept writing.', 'Electronic music, especially, has led the charge for Ukrainian defiance at home and abroad. The young composer Oleh Shudeiko, who performs as Heinali, livestreamed from a Lviv bomb shelter his gossamer adaptations of medieval polyphony for modular synthesizers. On “From Ukraine, For Ukraine,” a darkly brilliant new omnibus album by the cutting-edge Kyiv label Standard Deviation, grief and rage melt into impudently beautiful contemporary threnodies. Gasoline Radio, a noncommercial station launched in Kyiv just this year, has kept Ukrainian house, techno and even folk music streaming worldwide, even amid the power cuts. Repair Together, a volunteer initiative, brings club kids to liberated towns, clearing the wreckage at 140 beats per minute.', 'All over Kyiv, outside Saint Sophia Cathedral and at gas stations by the highway, there’s a government billboard campaign with a one-word slogan, overlaid on images of soldiers, firefighters, grandpas, dog walkers. The word is bravery, a quality we honor in others but have grown lazy in asking of ourselves. David, too, was an artist-propagandist who put bravery at the core of civic life, and, revisiting “Radical Draftsman” after the Russian invasion, I found that his hard lines had taken on the force of a commandment. His Horatii triplets, arms raised as they pledge to fight to the death for the Roman cause. His Sabine women, stepping between two armies, risking their lives and their children’s to stop the fighting. His Spartans at Thermopylae, who refused to surrender to a vastly larger invading army — and whom the Zelensky administration invoked after the siege of Mariupol, which it styled “the Thermopylae of the 21st century.”', 'Is art worth dying for? No, I don’t think so. But art can summon us to perceive what we cannot live without, through forms and chronicles that might — in the words of one unnamed revolutionary critic, looking at David’s drawing of “The Oath of the Tennis Court” in 1791 — “exude a love of country, of virtue and of liberty.” On my desk, now, there’s a glass vial containing a single ear of wheat, each spikelet charred black at its edges. It was a gift from a Ukrainian curator, now a refugee in Paris, and it came from a field near Kherson that the occupiers burned as collective punishment. Thousands of these burnt wheat stalks lay underfoot in an exhibition of paintings and ceramics made since Feb. 24. The show was called “Terre Libre.” Free land.']"

Putin, participants said, even if the activists acknowledge how difficult any change will be.', '“You cannot build a state on violence; it was the common ground under everything in the Soviet Union and in Russia,” said Inna Berezkina of the Moscow School of Civic Education, one of the organizers. “It will be up to those who did not start this war to lead the society out of the rut, and that takes a lot of strength. You have to understand the depth of society’s decline, understand how much we, our parents, our grandparents and many generations before them are involved in this.”', 'Russian opposition figures abroad have historically been a quarrelsome bunch, and the current crop is no different. They have never been able to settle on one leader of the movement, for example, and conferences have erupted into arguments over issues like whether the current conflict should be called “Putin’s war” or “Russia’s war” or whether this is 1917 all over again.', 'Alexei Navalny, having run as a candidate in Russian elections, is probably the only politician with the credentials and the charisma to claim the mantle of a legitimate leading opposition figure, but he is in jail for the foreseeable future. His lieutenants decided to avoid working with other exiled groups, suggesting it would require too much time and energy that would be better spent opposing Mr. Putin.', 'Ask other activists, especially younger ones, about Russians who assert themselves as potential opposition leaders, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oil oligarch jailed by Mr. Putin, or Garry Kasparov, the chess champion, and the response is likely to be universal: They have long been removed from Russia and represent only themselves. An attempt in November by a small group including numerous regional politicians from decades ago to form a “government in exile” was also met with scorn as lacking any popular mandate.', 'The absence of a unifying figure is keenly felt, as is any agreement on how broad to make their goals. “We do not have a united opposition, we have no leaders, we don’t understand what we should do,” said Polina Yelina, 35, an internet technology specialist who fled the country to save her two college-age sons from military conscription.', 'After attending two conferences organized several months apart in Lithuania by the Free Russia Forum, Ms. Yelina said that she felt that one was an exact replica of the other, with little creativity or diversity of ideas.', 'Everyone acknowledges the difficulty involved in bringing about change, given that Russia under Mr. Putin has outlawed even the most mundane opposition activity and forced much of civil society into exile rather than face time in a penal colony. More and more activists have been officially designated “foreign agents,” a resurrected Stalinist label implying that they are traitors.', '“Hopefully sooner or later the guns will be silent and then Russia will have left Ukraine, but then what comes next?” Tobias Lindner, a senior official at the German Foreign Ministry, which helped underwrite the Berlin gathering, said in a speech. “Right now it seems up in the air in what direction Russia will develop.”', 'He called the activists the “democratic hope for a future Russia.”', 'With each major historical transition, from the Russian Empire to the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation, the country had never reckoned with its past, said Mr. Yangulbaev, 30, the Chechen activist whose mother has been imprisoned by Ramzan Kadyrov, the republic’s strongman leader.', 'Mr. Yangulbaev noted as an example the banned Russian human rights organization Memorial, a co-recipient of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. The group had compiled a list of 3,000 possible war crimes during the two wars that were waged to prevent Chechnya from breaking away from Russia. Only a few of the perpetrators were jailed, according to Memorial.', 'He also noted that some opposition groups just want to save Russia, some want to dismantle it and others have an highly progressive agenda.', '“If we cannot solve our internal problems, we will always have external problems, there will be more Ukraines,” he said. “Russia will go on just the same even if it loses.”', 'Representatives of Indigenous groups also sought to highlight that a disproportionate number of soldiers from their generally impoverished regions are being mobilized — and are dying. “It’s not our war, that is the main idea,” said Lana Kondakova, a representative of the Free Yakutia Foundation, Yakutia being one of the largest regions in Siberia, rich in diamonds and other resources.', '“What is important to us right now is whether the Russian Federation will retain its current form or whether it will be transformed into a different kind of state,” added Aldar Erendhzhenov, a member of Free Kalmykia, another Indigenous rights group.', 'Some of those trying to effect change are working from inside Russia despite facing up to 15 years in jail for criticizing the war. One regional legislator, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said he was happy to take a breather from being inside Russia just to be able to use the word “war” to describe the conflict without facing criminal charges.', '“I really want to not feel alone in fighting Putin’s regime and its military appetite,” he said.', 'The legislator noted that one of the failings of those agitating for change from the outside is that they forget that issues like economic sanctions or the lack of geopolitical support for Russia are too abstract for ordinary Russians. And the unrelenting negative views of the country presented by opposition media do not align with their views of Russia or the war.', 'Perhaps the most daunting task facing the opposition, unified or not, is to try to influence change from abroad. “My colleagues and I ask ourselves this question every day: What we can do outside to change the mood inside Russia?” said Natalia Baranova, 29, who works with both an organization called the Greenhouse for Social Technology and the Feminist Anti-War Resistance, a protest group formed when the war started last February.', 'The group has managed to aid small-scale protests domestically, including distributing antiwar leaflets, and produced a petition against mobilization that a few thousand mothers of draftees signed.', 'One idea bandied about is that both Ukraine and Russia will need some form of Marshall Plan, the American effort after World War II to transform Germany from its Nazi past into a vibrant democracy. But that was done under occupation, activists noted, while any attempt to reconstitute Russia and to shine a harsh spotlight on decades of repression will have to be done by Russians themselves.', 'The entire country needs to rid itself of its “empire state of mind,” said Ms. Berezkina, a conference organizer. “If this quantum leap does not happen, perhaps even the end of the war and the victory of Ukraine will not save the situation.”']"

The assaults also showed millions of Russians for the first time that they, too, might be vulnerable.', 'Ukraine’s new long-range striking ability came into focus on Monday with attacks on air bases some 300 miles from the nearest Ukrainian territory, demonstrating the ability to evade Russian air defenses and hit with precision. Both the Russian government and a senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to convey sensitive information, said they were carried out by Ukraine using drones.', '“If Russia assesses the incidents were deliberate attacks, it will probably consider them as some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since its invasion of Ukraine,” Britain’s defense ministry said in an intelligence assessment released on Tuesday.', 'On Tuesday, an explosion ignited fuel tanks near an air base in the Kursk region of southwestern Russia, about 80 miles from Ukraine. Russian officials said it was another drone attack but did not explicitly blame Ukraine.', 'The subject remains sensitive enough for Ukraine’s government to assiduously avoid any public acknowledgment of responsibility for the strikes. But there is a widespread sense among officials and civilians that, short of nuclear escalation, there is little more Russia can do to Ukraine in retaliation that it is not already doing, with its waves of strikes on the country’s energy grid and other infrastructure.', '“If somebody attacks you, you fight back,” Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian minister of defense, said in an interview, clarifying that he did not speak for the government and could not confirm the strikes. “You cannot consider, this person will attack you because you are fighting back. There is absolutely no strategic reason not to try to do this.”', 'As of this week, he added, “the understandings of Russians that they are invincible and cannot be reached in Russia is not going to be there.”', 'Western analysts agreed that there was little risk of escalation by Moscow. Russia has already escalated, said Robin Niblett, former director of Chatham House, the London research institution, “by destroying Ukrainian infrastructure to try to change the strategic context of the war, force Ukraine to the negotiating table and warn Europeans that it becomes more expensive day by day to rebuild Ukraine.”', 'Kyiv has sought since early in the war to take the fighting to Russia. Within a month of the invasion in February, the Ukrainian military staged a helicopter assault on fuel depots in Russia, prompting the first Russian air raid alarm since World War II. Explosions at ammunition warehouses, railroad bridges, fuel depots and military bases inside Russia and Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine followed.', 'But those attacks were launched at fairly close range, no more than a few dozen miles.', 'In October, the Ukrainian state weapons manufacturer, Ukroboronprom, said it was finalizing development of a drone with a range of more than 600 miles and a 165-pound warhead. And on Sunday — a day before two distant Russian bases were hit — the company said it had completed testing of the new weapon.', 'Russia’s Ministry of Defense said the strikes on Monday used Soviet-era, jet-powered drones. Arms experts said the particular aircraft was probably the Tupolev TU-141 Strizh, a surveillance drone first developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and repurposed by the Ukrainians, possibly carrying an explosive. Analysts say it can fly at 600 miles per hour at low altitudes, much like some cruise missiles, making it difficult to detect and shoot down.', 'The attacks are “a kind of symbolic gesture,” said Douglas Barrie, a military aerospace expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “You go after the bomber bases with something you’ve got in your inventory, or in the museum, or you’ve got hidden at the back of your airfield because you haven’t used it for a long time.”', 'Though the attacks this week do not appear to have diminished Russia’s military capacity significantly, Ukraine’s determination to strike inside Russia could pose a challenge for the Western allies, which are determined not to be drawn into a shooting war with Russia.', '“We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a news conference on Tuesday. “But the important thing is to understand what Ukrainians are living through every day, with the ongoing Russian aggression against their country, and our determination to make sure that they have in their hands, along with many other partners around the world, the equipment they need to defend themselves and to defend their territory.”', 'The United States and other NATO countries have consistently declined to provide Kyiv with Western weapons that could reach targets far into Moscow’s territory, like the ATACMS missile, which has a range of up to 190 miles, with much higher speed and more explosive power than a drone. The allies have also been unwilling to provide Ukraine with the modern Western tanks and fighter jets it has requested.', 'But Ulrich Speck, a German foreign policy analyst, said that Russian threats to ratchet up the war, particularly with nuclear weapons, have rung increasingly hollow. World leaders friendly to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, have warned against it, and U.S. officials have threatened unspecified dire consequences if the Kremlin takes that step.', 'NATO and Washington, Mr. Speck said, “have accepted that the Ukrainians are driving this forward, and over time, fear of Russian escalation has receded.”', 'Russian airfields and the warplanes based there have been used to launch many of the missiles that Moscow’s forces have used for months to pummel Ukraine far behind the front lines, killing civilians and damaging vital services like housing, power, heat and water.', 'Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army officer, wrote on the Substack blogging platform of Ukraine’s new readiness to attack inside Russia: “It is not, as some are sure to claim, an escalation. But it is a necessary political and military measure for Ukraine to limit the humanitarian harm of Russia’s brutal drone and missile attacks.”', 'The Engels air base on the Volga River, one of those hit on Monday, is the kind of sensitive target the United States and its allies have feared Ukraine might hit with long-range Western weapons, if it had them. The base is home to a number of Russia’s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, a component of Russia’s nuclear deterrent force, and there have been unconfirmed reports that some of those bombers were damaged in the attack.', 'Ukrainian officials do not believe Russia has the capacity to escalate its conventional military assault on their country in response, and in fact hope that attacks on Russian soil will degrade that ability, said Mr. Zagorodnyuk, the former defense minister.', '“The consideration, from what I can see, is that Russia will use any available means, regardless of our responses, in order to coerce Ukraine into submission,” he said. “That is their strategic plan.”']"

In some cases, Ukraine has hinted that it is responsible.', 'In the latest incident, three Russian servicemen died after a Ukrainian drone was shot down on the approach to Engels military air base deep inside Russia, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday. It was the second attack this month on the base, which is around 300 miles from Ukraine’s border and houses some of Russia’s strategic bombers.', 'Here is a timeline of some other attacks.', 'Two low-flying Ukrainian helicopters crossed into Russia and fired on an oil depot in the city of Belgorod, 20 miles from the border. The attack, which occurred on April 1 and was reported by a regional governor, was the first time since the full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24 that Russia reported a Ukrainian airstrike on its territory.', 'Explosions also ripped through oil depots in late April in the Russian city of Bryansk, a logistical hub less than 100 miles from the Ukrainian border.', 'In mid-April, two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit Russia’s flagship, the Moskva, in the Black Sea, about 65 nautical miles south of Odesa, Ukraine. The ship later sank, and many sailors died. The Russian government said only that the ship had sunk after an accidental fire caused by an explosion.', 'Afterward, some Russian commentators asked why the pride of the country’s Black Sea fleet had not been better protected.', 'Explosions on Aug. 9 struck the Saki Air Base in Crimea, a region illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. The Russian authorities said munitions stored at the site had blown up, but satellite images appeared to show at least eight wrecked warplanes. A senior Ukrainian official said the blasts had been an attack carried out with the help of partisans.', 'Daria Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, was killed when her vehicle blew up in a Moscow suburb on Aug. 20. U.S. officials later said they believed that Ukraine’s government had authorized the attack, and some said they suspected that Ms. Dugina’s father, Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian ultranationalist, was the actual target.', 'Early on Oct. 8, an explosion destroyed part of a road and rail bridge that connects Russia with the Crimean Peninsula and had served as the main supply route for its forces in southern Ukraine.', 'President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had claimed personal credit for the bridge project, driving a truck along its 12-mile length when it opened in 2018.', 'Russia accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and said that one minesweeper had sustained minor damage. A senior Ukrainian official said the vessel had been severely damaged. Video, never confirmed, later emerged of a sea drone heading toward a ship as gunfire peppers the water around it.', 'The attacks entered a new phase in early December, when Ukrainian drones struck Engels and another military airport in Russia.

One reliable route they found came from a small Swiss company based nearly 2,000 miles away.', 'The company, Proton, provides free software that masks a person’s identity and location online. That gives a user in Russia access to the open web by making it appear that the person is logging in from the Netherlands, Japan or the United States. A couple of weeks after the internet blockade, about 850,000 people inside Russia used Proton each day, up from fewer than 25,000.', 'That is, until the end of March, when the Russian government found a way to block Proton, too.', 'Targeting Proton was the opening salvo of a continuing back-and-forth battle, pitting a team of about 25 engineers against a country embarking on one of the most aggressive censorship campaigns in recent memory.', 'Working from a Geneva office where the company keeps its name off the building directory, Proton has spent nine pressure-packed months repeatedly tweaking its technology to avoid Russian blocks, only to be countered again by government censors in Moscow. Some employees took Proton off their social media profiles out of concern that they would be targeted personally.', 'The high-stakes chess match mirrors what is playing out with growing frequency in countries facing coups, wars and authoritarian rule, where restricting the internet is a tool of repression. The blocks drive citizens to look for workarounds. Engineers at companies like Proton think up new ways for those people to secretly reach the open web. And governments, in turn, seek out new technical tricks to plug leaks.', 'The digital censorship battle is reaching “an inflection point,” said Grant Baker, a research analyst for technology and democracy at Freedom House, which recently reported that internet censorship globally had reached a new high in 2022. While Russia has spent years working on a more closely controlled, sovereign internet, the controls imposed after the war are “a stark contrast” to anything Moscow had ever done before, Mr. Baker said.', 'Companies rarely discuss being targeted by an authoritarian government out of fear of escalating the conflict. But Andy Yen, Proton’s founder and chief executive, said that after a period of trying to keep its “head down,” Proton wanted to raise awareness about the increasing sophistication of governments, in Russia and elsewhere, to block citizens from reaching the open web and the need for technologists, companies and governments to push back.', 'Proton’s account provides a rare inside look at what it’s like to be entangled in Russia’s censorship net as President Vladimir V. Putin tries to suppress information about the war and mounting battlefield losses in Ukraine.', 'Dozens of VPN services have been blocked inside Russia, but Proton, perhaps best known for its encrypted email service, seemed to receive extra attention from the authorities. In June, Russia’s internet regulator labeled the company a “threat.”', '“We’re gearing up for a long fight,” Mr. Yen said in an interview at the company’s office. “Everybody hopes this will have a happy ending, but it’s not guaranteed. We don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, in fact, but you keep going because if we don’t do it, then maybe nobody else will.”', 'Proton, which makes money by selling $10-a-month subscriptions for extra features, was founded in 2014 by a team of young engineers from the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, the institute outside Geneva where the worldwide web was created. Their main project was working on the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest particle accelerator, a $5 billion instrument built to unlock some of the world’s biggest scientific mysteries.', 'After the disclosures of mass digital surveillance that were made by Edward Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor, Mr. Yen and a few colleagues created an email service that encrypts messages so they cannot be intercepted, simplifying use of a technology that had been too complicated for many people. It became popular with activists, journalists and privacy-conscious consumers.', 'Mr. Yen, who grew up in Taiwan, said the threat of Chinese aggression looming over the island’s democracy had shaped his worldview. Privacy and fighting censorship were core to Proton’s mission from the start, he said, and the company seemed to almost relish confronting authoritarianism.', 'In 2017, after several governments, including Turkey and Russia, temporarily blocked access to the email service, Proton created its virtual private network, or VPN, a technology used to sidestep internet restrictions.', 'The technology behind a VPN traces back to the 1990s. It is a relatively basic tool used most commonly by people trying to pirate movies or watch a sports broadcast available only in another country. Yet in recent years the systems, which are easy to use and often difficult to detect, have become a vital tool for circumventing internet restrictions.', 'The Kremlin spent years building the legal foundation and technological abilities to control the internet more closely. Yet even as Russia blocked certain websites and interrupted access to Twitter last year, few thought it would outright block major social media platforms and independent news websites. While television has always been heavily censored, the internet had been less restricted.', 'The crackdown in March interrupted communications and commerce for many otherwise apolitical Russians, said Natalia Krapiva, tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a group focused on online speech-related issues. VPN use was already high among tech-savvy Russians, she said, but the blocks and news of harsh punishment for online protest led even more casual internet users to seek ways around the restrictions.', 'Demand for VPNs surged in Russia, with downloads in March jumping 2,692 percent from February, said Simon Migliano, head of research for the review site Top10VPN.com. Proton was a popular choice, he said, hovering among the 10 most popular products despite being slower than some other choices.', 'Since then, VPNs have become a way of life for many. Roskomsvoboda, a Russian civil society group focused on internet freedom, estimates that a quarter of the Russian population is using one.', '“To simply read independent news or to post a picture, you had to open your VPN,” said Viktoriia Safonova, 25, who now delivers food by bike in Sweden after she fled Russia in July. Both she and her partner were racked by anxiety after the invasion. Finding independent news and information was difficult. Workarounds often weren’t reliable.', '“If the one you’re using gets blocked, you have to find another VPN,” Ms. Safonova said.', 'She recalled the paranoia that set in as new internet restrictions and surveillance took effect. She and her partner, Artem Nesterenko, worried about whether they could criticize the war online, even on international social networks. He recalled how the police had come to check on their building after he scrawled “No to war” in the elevator. He feared being arrested for things he posted online.', 'As people turned to VPN services to avoid the blocks, Proton struggled to keep up. Over a weekend in March, engineers scrambled to buy and configure more than 20 new servers to avert a crash of its entire network.', 'At the same time in Moscow, censors were at work trying to patch holes in the government’s internet controls.', 'The first block that took down Proton, at the end of March, was a technically basic interruption that company engineers quickly overcame, but they figured more powerful attempts loomed.', 'The battle took on a “Spy vs. Spy” dynamic in Proton’s headquarters. Mr. Yen said a network of people within the government, telecommunications firms and civil society groups had helped Proton operate in Russia, providing access to local networks and sharing intelligence about how the censorship system worked. But those contacts began to go dark as the Kremlin’s crackdown on dissent intensified.', 'At the start of June, censors struck again.', 'The service, which had more than 1.4 million daily users inside Russia at this point, collapsed as employees were going about their day. Complaints from Russian users poured into Proton’s customer service email. The company concluded that the government had deployed more sophisticated software that could filter through all internet traffic to identify when a person was trying to connect to Proton’s VPN service. Russia had used similar technology to block Twitter and other social media sites.', 'Around this time, the company noticed a suspicious spike in negative reviews of its service in the Apple and Google app stores, reducing its search ranking.', '“They had clearly studied us,” said Antonio Cesarano, a senior engineer working on the VPN project.', 'Some at Proton questioned whether they should continue the fight with Russia. It was costing millions of dollars and slowing down development of other products. But after Proton faced criticism in 2021, when the French police obtained the IP address of a climate activist using its email service, backing down from Russia could have added another bruise to the company’s reputation.', 'Over about two weeks in June, Proton created yet another workaround that bounced internet traffic to servers in different geographical areas faster than censors could track. It was a technically complex move that would take considerable resources for Russia to counter.', 'The fix worked — for about six weeks.', 'Mr. Yen was interrupted during a staff meeting in mid-July with news that Russian censors had come up with an even more elaborate block. A corporate chart from the time shows use dropping off a cliff. Russian engineers had identified what is known as an authentication “handshake,” the vital moment when Proton’s VPN connection gets established before reaching the wider web. Blocking the link made Proton’s service essentially unusable.', '“We had no idea what was happening and how they were doing it,” Mr. Cesarano said.', 'By August, after working around the clock for days to find a fix, Proton acknowledged defeat and pulled its app from Russia. The company has spent the months since then developing a new architecture that makes its VPN service harder to identify because it looks more like a regular website to censorship software scanning a country’s internet traffic. Proton has been successfully testing the system in Iran, where Proton has seen a sharp increase in VPN use during recent political demonstrations.', 'In Russia, Proton has reintroduced its apps using the new system. Mr. Yen acknowledged that it probably wasn’t a long-term fix. He has confidence in the new technology, but figures Russian engineers will eventually figure out a new way to push back, and the game will continue.']"

Eventually, they settled in neighboring Latvia, where they continued to counter the Kremlin’s propaganda and denounce its aggression to millions of viewers back home.', 'On Tuesday, however, days after a correspondent made an unscripted call to provide unspecified aid to Russian soldiers, the Latvian media regulator revoked the channel’s broadcasting license because of what it called “threats to national security.” As Latvian and Ukrainian authorities accuse the station of supporting Russia’s war effort, TV Rain is now engulfed in the biggest crisis of its turbulent 12-year history.', 'The controversy, which also cost the journalist his job, has also exposed how Russian political exiles are struggling to find a role in the conflict unleashed by their nation, particularly in Eastern European states like Latvia, which were once controlled by Moscow. In these countries, support for Ukraine is partly driven by fears of Russian aggression and suspicion of their own ethnic Russian minorities, and it plays out against a historical backdrop of hardships endured under the Soviet Union.', '“The team left Russia to continue showing the reality of Russia’s war to Russian people,” said Vera Krichevskaya, a TV Rain co-founder based in London. “But we are left without a territory. We have no rights in Russia and we have no rights in Europe.”', 'The controversy began after Thursday’s live evening news show, when the correspondent, Aleksey Korostelev, a well-known TV Rain news host, asked viewers to send information on conscripted Russian soldiers to a tip line that the channel had established to publicize the irregularities in the mobilization effort.', '“We hope that we were able to help many servicemen, among others, with equipment or just elementary amenities at the front,” he added.', 'The response was swift.', '“When ‘good Russians’ are helping ‘bad Russians’ — can the world understand finally that they are all the same?” wrote Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko.', 'The revoking of the station’s license came after an investigation into Mr. Korostelev’s remarks. The media regulator said that his comment was TV Rain’s third violation of its rules, adding that it had received classified information about the channel’s activities from the state security agency.', 'Last week, the regulator fined TV Rain for using a map showing Crimea as part of Russia and for referring to the Russian military as “our army.”', 'Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, went further, calling for the expulsion of the channel’s journalists.', 'Even before Tuesday, Kremlin supporters had pounced, calling the backlash against the remark an example of European hypocrisy.', '“The TV Rain drama has shown many anti-Putin émigrés that there’s no freedom there,” a former Kremlin adviser, Sergei Markov, wrote on Telegram.', 'To try to contain the damage, TV Rain fired Mr. Korostelev hours after his comment, adding that the company never had and never would provide aid to any military.', 'In a Telegram post on Friday, Mr. Korostelev apologized for his comment, which he said had been taken out of context.', 'TV Rain has 3.7 million subscribers on YouTube. Around 18 to 22 million unique visitors view its YouTube channel alone every month, with up to 80 percent of them from inside Russia, said Tikhon Dzyadko, the station’s editor in chief. It also has a cable channel in five countries with large Russian-speaking populations.', 'The loss of the license has cost TV Rain its access to the Latvian cable network, and its YouTube channel inside Latvia could also be banned, said Ms. Krichevskaya, the TV Rain co-founder. She added, though, that TV Rain would continue streaming on social media in other countries until it obtains a new license.', 'One topic that has strongly resonated with the station’s viewers is President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to mobilize at least 300,000 Russian men to replace his military losses in Ukraine. That decision has confronted millions of Russians with the reality of the war, which many had previously ignored or downplayed.', 'Since the start of the mobilization in September, TV Rain’s audience has grown fivefold, Ms. Krichevskaya said, pointing out that the silence on state TV caused Russians to flock to TV Rain to find out who was being called up and what awaited them at the front.', 'She added that by covering the mobilization, TV Rain could reach beyond opposition supporters to the apolitical majority of Russian people. As the channel focused its efforts on documenting mounting cases of draft irregularities and the inhumane living conditions of the mobilized men, its journalists felt, she said, as if they had begun contributing toward their overarching professional goal: stopping the war.', 'In a telephone interview on Sunday, Mr. Korostelev, the correspondent, said that in his appeal he had been trying to help conscripted Russian men by collecting information on the wrongdoings of authorities, and then documenting the cases. He was not soliciting matériel for them, he added.', 'He said that the controversy had exposed a fundamental dilemma facing Russian journalists, and antiwar Russian exiles in general: How do they connect with compatriots back home without minimizing their country’s aggression?', '“Ukrainians are undoubtedly the first and foremost victims of this war, but the suffering of Russians is also important,” said Mr. Korostelev, who left Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “If they are dying in this war, then they are also its victims.”', 'He said that he acknowledged the moral ambiguity of that position: Even moral support for Russian conscripts fighting an illegal war on occupied territory could indirectly contribute to Ukrainian deaths, he said.', 'Nevertheless, he said he would continue highlighting the injustices faced by ordinary Russians.', '“I am a Russian citizen working for a Russian audience,” Mr. Korostelev said. “I will not assume a position that will turn me from a Russian journalist into a person who defends the interests of other people.”', 'Three TV Rain journalists resigned in solidarity with Mr. Korostelev. And his supporters say that portraying all Russian citizens as aggressors merely helps to perpetuate Mr. Putin’s rule by marginalizing his opponents.', '“Aleksey was looking for new allies, was trying to destroy the walls of this ghetto into which the Kremlin is trying to corral the liberal opposition,” wrote Abbas Galiamov, a Russian political scientist, referring to Mr. Korostelev. Mr. Galiamov was a speechwriter for Mr. Putin but has broken with the Russian president.', 'In the Baltic States, though, attempts to humanize Russian soldiers are particularly contentious. Many Russian ethnic minorities in those countries support the Kremlin in its claims of the unity of Russian people, and their ranks are being swelled by thousands of Russian arrivals since the start the war.', 'After Mr. Korostelev’s comment, the Latvian security agency called Russian journalists in the country an “intelligence risk,” because they could have ties to Moscow’s intelligence agencies or because they could be spied on by the Kremlin.', 'But some Russian journalists in Latvia say stigmatization of any national group goes against the European Union’s fundamental values and tests the bloc’s commitment to support Russians fleeing political persecution.', '“Latvia is committed to its policy of supporting independent media, including those forced to flee Russia,” Diana Eglite, spokeswoman for the Latvian Foreign Ministry, said on Tuesday. She added that her country had issued nearly 470 visas to Russian journalists and their families since the outbreak of the war.', 'However, “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has changed the security situation dramatically, also for Latvia,” she added.', 'TV Rain has run into other problems in Latvia, Ms. Krichevskaya said, including over its reference to Russia’s military as “our army,” for which it was separately fined.', 'That, she said, highlighted a fundamental sticking point.', '“To be accessible to Russian viewers, to be able to connect with them in a manner that they respond to, we have to speak to them as Russians,” Ms. Krichevskaya said. “We have to be able to say to them that our army is responsible for 40,000 atrocities.”', 'But the use of this phrase broke Latvia’s digital media law, creating, according to the government, the false impression that TV Rain may have been referring to the Latvian military.', 'Exiled Russian dissidents “cannot find the required message that will be simultaneously accepted in Europe, Ukraine and not alienate the Russian audience,” Maria Snegovaya, a Russian political scientist, wrote on Facebook.', '“In the war you have to choose,” she added. “There’s no middle ground.”']"

Shortly after the attacks on the bases, Russia sent a barrage of missiles streaking toward Ukrainian cities.', 'The Kremlin said that the weapons launched by Ukraine were Soviet-era jet drones and were aimed at bases in Ryazan and Engels, about 300 miles from the Ukrainian border. It said that its forces had intercepted the drones, and that “the fall and explosion of the wreckage” had “slightly damaged” two planes, killing three servicemen and wounding four others.', 'The Engels airfield, on the Volga River in southern Russia, is a base for some of Russia’s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, including the Tupolev-160 and Tupolev-95. Ukrainian officials say it is also a staging ground for Russia’s unrelenting campaign of missile attacks on infrastructure, which have left millions of Ukrainians with intermittent light, heat or water — or none at all — at the onset of winter. Security footage from an apartment complex near the base showed a fireball lighting up the sky.', 'The other explosion occurred at the Dyagilevo military base in the central city of Ryazan, about 100 miles from Moscow, according to Russia’s defense ministry. It was there that the fatalities and injuries occurred, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.', 'Ukraine’s government declined to publicly acknowledge the strikes, in keeping with its practice of intentional ambiguity on attacks in Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. But officials have established a pattern of comments suggestive of Ukraine’s involvement.', '“The Earth is round — discovery made by Galileo,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on Twitter after the strikes at Russian bases. “If something is launched into other countries’ airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.”', 'On the economic front of the war, the United States and its allies on Monday took their most serious steps so far to deprive Russia of at least some of the oil revenue that is vital to its government and economy. The Group of 7 wealthy democracies began trying to enforce a $60-a-barrel cap on the price of Russian oil on global markets, and a European Union embargo on most oil purchases from Russia took effect. ', 'Ukraine’s Western backers have refused to supply it with long-range weapons that could strike far into Russian territory, trying to avoid being drawn more deeply into the conflict. But Ukraine’s state-owned weapons maker, Ukroboronprom, said in October that it was “finalizing the development” of a drone with a 165-pound warhead and a range of more than 600 miles, and said on Sunday that it had completed tests of the weapon.', '“We hope to be able to test it in combat use,” Natalia Sad, a spokeswoman for the arms maker, said on national television Sunday night.', 'It was not clear how Ukrainian special forces were able to infiltrate Russia, or how close to either base they got. But the car bomb assassination in August of the ultranationalist commentator Daria Dugina, believed to have been carried out by Ukrainians, showed similar capabilities.', '“Ukraine’s ability to strike deep into Russian territory is not just militarily significant,” said Max Bergmann, a former American diplomat and expert on European and Russian security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.', '“It also sends a message to Russia that continuing the war is not cost-free, that it is not just Ukraine which is vulnerable to long range drone and missile strikes; so is Russia,” Mr. Bergmann said. “This is useful for Kyiv, since when or if the two countries ever sit down, a commitment to stop attacks on Russian territory is now a valuable chip Ukraine has to offer.”', 'Ukraine has already demonstrated its ability to use drones in new and unexpected ways, and to adapt old systems to perform new functions.', 'The naval harbor of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea, home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, was rocked by a series of mysterious explosions on Oct. 29.

As of this time, there are four people killed by Russian strikes today.”', 'Amid the volley of attacks, the remains of a missile were discovered on the territory of Moldova, to the west of Ukraine, the Moldovan Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page.

A small team of its researchers arrived in Kyiv just before the attack at the invitation of the Ukrainian security service.', 'In four previous research trips to Kyiv since the invasion, the investigators found that almost all of the advanced Russian military gear they examined — like encrypted radios and laser range finders — was built with Western semiconductors.', 'The investigators were unable to determine whether the Kh-101 remnants they studied were from missiles that reached their targets and exploded or were intercepted in flight and shot down.', 'The Kh-101 missiles were marked with a 13-digit numerical sequence. The investigators said they believe that the first three digits represent the factory where the missile was made, followed by another three-digit code indicating which of two known versions of the Kh-101 it is and two digits indicating when it was manufactured. A final string of five numbers is believed to denote the missile’s production batch and serial number.', 'Piotr Butowski, a Polish journalist who has written extensively about Russia’s warplanes and military munitions, said the group’s numerical analysis matched up with his research.', '“The first three digits are always ‘315’ — this is the production facility code,” Mr. Butowski said in an email. “Kh-101 missiles are developed and manufactured by the Raduga company in Dubna near Moscow.”', 'In an interview before the report was released, a U.S. defense intelligence analyst said that Mr. Butowski’s analysis was consistent with the government’s understanding of how Russian missile producers — including those that make the Kh-101 — mark their weapons. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Russia was generally believed to be experiencing ammunition stockpile problems and may be using newer munitions alongside those that are much older.', 'The analyst said that reports from Russia indicate that the government has ordered employees at munition plants to work additional hours in an effort to produce more ordnance, and that it is clear that Russia is now firing fewer long-range weapons like cruise missiles at a smaller number of targets in Ukraine.', 'Pentagon officials say Russia has fired thousands of long-range weapons like cruise missiles as well as short- and medium-range ballistic missiles at targets in Ukraine since the war began.', 'Whether Russia has depleted its inventory of older cruise missiles is unclear. But militaries often use older munitions first in combat because they typically make up a majority of a nation’s stockpile.', 'On Nov. 23, the same day as the cruise missile attack on Kyiv, Lloyd J. Austin III, the secretary of defense, told reporters that Russia’s supply of precision-guided weapons had been “significantly reduced” and that it would be more difficult for Russia to rapidly produce them “because of the trade restrictions they have on microchips and other types of things.”', 'But Damien Spleeters, who led Conflict Armament Research’s investigation, said it would be difficult to say that the Russians are running short on weapons.', '“Those claims have been made since April,” he said, “so we’re just pointing to the fact that these cruise missiles being made so recently may be a symptom of that, but it’s not a certainty.”']"

Mr. Volodin, 41, had little choice: The car factory closed down in March, joining more than 1,000 multinational companies that had curtailed operations in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.', 'Since then, he has been sitting at home while Volkswagen looks for a buyer. He goes into the plant, in Kaluga’s industrial zone, once a month to collect 50,000 rubles, about $800, a payment required by Russian labor law that is the equivalent of two-thirds of his previous salary.', '“We go into work, but the plant stands empty,” Mr. Volodin said in an interview. He does not mind a temporary break from the physically demanding work, but he is not sure how to plan for the future.', '“We live day to day, for now,” he said.', 'His experience is playing out across Russia for hundreds of thousands of workers after the West imposed sweeping economic sanctions that were intended to hobble Moscow’s ability to wage war and to undercut public support for President Vladimir V. Putin.', 'More than nine months after the invasion, neither the war effort nor the economy has collapsed, and the economic pain is still limited for many Russians. Mr. Putin has avoided any substantive domestic pressure that would threaten his leadership. But the impact of what some have described as the most coordinated and deepest economic sanctions in modern history is evident in communities across Russia — and the worst may be yet to come.', 'The sanctions have stymied Russia’s faltering attempts to modernize its economy along Western lines and to catch up to European living standards after the fall of the Soviet Union, said Vladislav Inozemtsev, the Washington-based director of the Center for Post-Industrial Studies, a Russian research group. That has dimmed the hope that the country could become a modern, prosperous nation in the near term.', '“The slogan now is ‘Keep things from getting worse,’ and that’s an important shift,” Mr. Inozemtsev said. “Even the government has stopped betting on national development.”', 'Beneath the veneer of normalcy, he said, key drivers of growth, like technology transfer and investment, are eroding. “It’s like a cake that was dropped on the table and it looks more or less fine, but inside it’s all blown up,’’ Mr. Inozemtsev said.', 'The most visible and dramatic impact has been on manufacturing, a sector that employs 10 million Russians and that has been the centerpiece of Mr. Putin’s ambitious program to diversify the economy away from reliance on oil and gas exports. The auto industry accounts for a large percentage of those workers: Carmakers employ 300,000 Russians, according to the country’s statistics agency, and the association representing their interests say that up to 3.5 million more work in related industries.', 'By September, output in the auto industry was down 77 percent year over year, while car sales have plummeted 60 percent compared with the same period in 2021. A primary reason is that Russian industries are highly dependent on Western components. Even Mr. Putin has acknowledged the problem, admitting last week that, in some sectors, dependence on imported parts is as high as 90 percent.', 'To adapt, Russia is turning inward, cutting ties with the rest of the world and moving toward an economic model similar to one adopted by Iran, where political legitimacy rests on providing citizens with the essentials rather than spurring transformative growth, Mr. Inozemtsev said.', 'Russia’s government was better prepared to withstand the sanctions than many in the West expected.', 'Since the start of the war, the International Monetary Fund has revised its economic outlook for Russia upward twice and is forecasting a 3.5 percent decline in gross domestic product this year, similar to the government’s projections. This decline, while a major reversal from prewar growth expectations, stands in sharp contrast to the double digits collapse of Venezuela’s economic output after a wave of American sanctions in 2019.', '“Sanctions have not destroyed the resilience of the Russian financial system, nor have they impacted macroeconomic stability,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week during a government meeting.', 'A combination of high oil revenues, large currency reserves and an expert team of economic officials has allowed Mr. Putin to soften the blow — much to the frustration of some Western leaders who had hoped the sanctions would have more bite by now.', 'But the loss of investment, technology and skills caused by the sanctions is likely to echo across generations, depriving many Russians of a chance at a better economic future, experts said.', 'In 2009, when Volkswagen launched full production cycles in Kaluga, Mr. Volodin not only got a job, but also unexpected support.', '“I got paid to get trained for my job,” he said, still impressed. When a robot replaced him, he was retrained.', 'Those were boom times for Kaluga, an industrial region about 120 miles south of Moscow. The former governor actively courted Western investors, learning English and building a modern airport with several flights a week to Germany. He transformed a regional economy that had been 80 percent oriented toward the Soviet military industrial complex into one connected with the West. Pharmaceutical companies flocked to the Kaluga region, which has a population of one million, and so did auto manufacturers.', 'Volkswagen hired about 4,200 workers. Volvo and Stellantis, which produced and sold the Peugeot, Citroёn, Opel, Jeep and Fiat brands in Russia, also established operations in the region. An ecosystem of suppliers and related industries sprang up to serve them, employing at least 25,000 people, according to Dmitri Trudovoy, the chairman of the independent Workers’ Association trade union. Courses in German and other foreign languages at the local university were a pipeline to an office job with the companies.', 'It seemed as if a new, modern business model was being constructed step by step in the region, a hint of how Russia’s economy might evolve.', 'By 2020, Volkswagen’s output alone represented about 13 percent of the Kaluga region’s entire industrial production. ', 'Now, most of the carmakers in the region have halted operations, and Mr. Trudovoy said the workers had no idea who might take over the Western factories and whether they would keep their jobs.', '“They are nervous and scared for their future,” he said.', 'Kaluga’s industrial output fell 30 percent between February and July this year compared with the same period the year before, according to Rosstat, Russia’s statistics agency, becoming among the regions hit hardest. ', 'Russian state firms and the government have vowed to replace the lost output with local brands. But there have been multiple signs of regression. In June, AvtoVAZ, which makes Russia’s best-known domestic car brand, the Lada, announced that its new cars would meet only 1996 emissions standards and have no passenger-side airbags.', 'In a symbolic move, an AvtoVAZ affiliate, Kamaz, announced that it would use a Moscow plant vacated by Renault after the invasion to relaunch the production of a Soviet-era car brand, Moskvich, or Muscovite, which had long been an almost comical byword for the deficiencies of Communist consumer goods.', 'The slowdown in auto manufacturing also means that even Russia’s police will have a hard time acquiring new patrol cars. The Interior Ministry has been unable to find a supplier for the 2,800 new vehicles required for the traffic police, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant.', 'Kamaz claims it will produce 50,000 “modern, comfortable, high-quality and safe” cars in the plant next year, including many with electric motors. To aid these efforts, the Russian government plans to channel about $500 million to domestic carmakers.', 'But modern history offers few examples of successful attempts to replace imported Western technology with local substitutes, said Mr. Inozemtsev, the economist. Russian companies lack the know-how and skilled workers to replace Western capital in technology-intensive sectors. Relying on homegrown substitutes will result in “primitivization,” Mr. Inozemtsev said.', 'Production will not disappear, he said, but it will gradually degrade, resulting in lower quality and quantity of products that will progressively reduce the standard of life of Russians.', 'In Kaluga, the collapse of the auto industry is having wide-ranging collateral effects. The real estate market ground to a halt after the war started, said Kirill Gusev, editor of the online real estate site Kaluga House. It started improving over the summer as people got used to a new normal, but then collapsed after Mr. Putin announced a military call-up of hundreds of thousands of men in September.', '“Real estate is essentially long-term planning, but right now we are in a place where you can’t do that at all,” Mr. Gusev said. “We all saw how easy it was for normality to collapse.”', '“After the mobilization, the banks stopped giving out loans because the clients could be called up,” he added.', 'Natalia Zubarevich, a geography professor who tracks social economic data at Moscow State University, said: “What we’re seeing is falling income, broad depression, less consumption. All this will negatively impact the economy of the country.”', 'Kirill Nikulin, who owns a popular bar in Kaluga called Savor, feels that hit. He had already adapted by finding substitutions for half the beers at his pub, which he had imported. Buoyed by the seeming return to normalcy over the summer, he opened a store, Hops & Hopes, which sells 13 craft beers on tap and 250 more in bottles.', 'On a recent evening, his store in the city center did not attract any paying customers.', '“We believe in the New Year,” he said, hoping sales would be up ahead of the holiday.', '“But after that, we might be screwed.”']"

Putin of Russia and was immediately picked up prominently by TASS, the Russian state news agency. It prompted an angry reaction in Ukraine.', 'Mr. Macron gave the interview during his state visit to the United States, which ended on Saturday. It was broadcast as he departed.', 'During his visit, Mr. Macron was at pains to underscore unequivocal French backing for the Ukrainian cause, pledging increased French military support, and President Biden indicated conditional openness to speaking to Mr. Putin. On that basis, the two leaders presented a united front.', 'There was no immediate American reaction to Mr. Macron’s remarks, but they appeared to go beyond anything the United States has offered Mr. Putin.', 'David Arakhamia, the chief of the Ukrainian negotiating group in talks with Russia that quickly collapsed early in the war, posted a scathing response to Mr. Macron’s proposal on Telegram.', 'He said that what Russia needed to do for negotiations to begin was “leave the territory of our country; pay reparations; punish all war criminals; voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.”', 'The last of these demands was a clear reference to the Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994. Under the accord, Russia was among the states that guaranteed Ukraine’s “independence and sovereignty in the existing borders” in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, but it has since been ignored by Mr. Putin.', 'Since 2019, when he declared the need for the reinvention of “an architecture of security” between the European Union and Russia, Mr. Macron has been insistent on the need to draw Russia into a new “stability order” in Europe.', 'Although he has condemned Mr. Putin’s “imperial” invasion with firmness, Mr. Macron has apparently not been swayed to reconsider the practicability of any Russian integration into a European security arrangement.', 'Responding to a tweet from TASS featuring Mr. Macron’s remarks, Nicolas Tenzer, a prominent French political scientist and essayist, commented: “Devastating.”', 'Dr. Alina Polyakova, president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a research institute based in Washington, commented on Mr. Tenzer’s tweet, saying: “You know you’re doing something terribly wrong when the Kremlin’s state propaganda praises you. It seems that no matter how brutal Putin is, Macron can’t let go of his flawed vision.”', 'There is deep suspicion of Mr. Macron’s approach to Russia in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and other states in the European Union and NATO that were once under the Soviet totalitarian yoke. This has undermined his aspirations to European leadership.', 'On Feb. 8, shortly before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Putin set out three demands at a joint news conference with Mr. Macron in Moscow. These were: an end to NATO enlargement; no missile deployments near Russia’s borders; and a reduction of NATO’s military infrastructure in Europe to its levels in 1997, before the Baltic and central European states previously controlled by Moscow joined the alliance.', 'The United States dismissed the Russian demands as “non-starters” at the time, but Mr. Macron appears to have a more nuanced view.']"

Supporters of the plan say it is likely to dent the Kremlin’s finances, while still keeping enough Russian crude on the market to avoid a global oil price shock.', 'On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the price cap would have a negative impact on the global market and would contradict World Trade Organization rules. He said that Russia was “working on mechanisms” to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.', '“We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,” he said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.', 'The price cap is set to take effect the same day as the European Union’s embargo on Russian crude imports.', 'While it was unclear whether the Kremlin would follow through with the threat to curb production — which would also harm Russia’s economy — questions already loomed over whether the new price cap can be enforced. It relies on each party in the supply chain of Russian oil to attest to the price of shipments, and insurers and shippers have warned that records could be falsified by those seeking to keep Russian oil flowing. Russia has repeatedly said it would ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap.', 'On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine criticized the price limit as inadequate to deter Russian aggression. Speaking in a nightly address one day after European Union diplomats reached the agreement following prolonged negotiations, he said the plan’s architects were “trying to avoid hard decisions.”', 'The $60-per-barrel threshold was a compromise: One group of European maritime nations had demanded the price cap be placed at or above $70 a barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted; another group of pro-Ukraine countries had demanded the cap be set at or around $30 a barrel to significantly slash Russia’s revenue. Eventually, the negotiators decided on a price that is in the neighborhood of what major buyers of Russian oil, like China and India, currently pay,', 'Mr. Zelensky found the deal lacking.', '“The logic is obvious: If the price limit for Russian oil is $60 instead of, for example, $30, which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive about $100 billion a year,” Mr. Zelensky said.', '“This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia’s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations,” he continued. “This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions.”', 'The United States had led the push for an agreement along the lines of what was ultimately negotiated. After the deal was announced, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen praised the plan. It helped “achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,” she said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.', 'Western sanctions have so far failed to weaken Moscow’s energy exports: Russia is on track to earn more this year from oil sales than in 2021, buoyed by a surge in the global price after the war began.', 'E.U. diplomats have agreed that the price cap should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group of 7 countries and allies.']"

The soldiers had taken Kherson with little resistance \xadbut then largely kept going, racing toward other territory and showing no interest in administering the city.', 'Looting and chaos followed until Mr. Karamalikov and others organized neighborhood patrols of local men. They weren’t working with the Russians but had their permission.', 'On the phone that night, one of Mr. Karamalikov’s watch leaders reported that a team of guards had encountered someone stumbling toward a checkpoint in a strange green uniform, slathered in mud, looking shellshocked. He wasn’t a looter. He was a lost Russian pilot, and they had disarmed him and were keeping him in a school classroom.', 'It was a highly unusual prisoner of war situation — a band of civilians capturing an enemy officer in a city that the enemy controls. “Nobody knew what to do,” said Mr. Karamalikov’s lawyer, Mykhailo Velychko. “They couldn’t hand him over to Ukrainian forces — there were no Ukrainian forces in the city at that time. And there was no Red Cross. And the Russians were everywhere.”', 'What followed over the next few hours and continues to play out in court months later reveals the blurred line between complicity and survival that many Ukrainians had to navigate after the Russians invaded their country — and that poses vexing problems for the authorities now as they decide whom to punish.', 'Mr. Karamalikov brought the captured pilot back to his house and locked him in a utility room. Later that night he arranged to return the soldier to the Russians. He saw no other option.', 'The Ukrainian authorities saw things differently.

The army disappeared. Police officers vanished from the streets.', '“It was a city without a head,” Rabbi Wolff said.', 'Many residents said they were in a state of shock. They felt abandoned by Ukrainian forces and wondered why they didn’t put up more of a fight.', '“Right now we support Zelensky, but after the war we will come back to him and ask him about this,” said Valentyn Yermolenko, a retired fishermen who lived through the occupation and provided snacks and hot coffee to the neighborhood watchmen.', 'Life in Kherson got harder and harder. Supplies couldn’t get across the front lines, and the city, with a prewar population of about 300,000, began to run out of food. The looting became so bad, residents said, that thieves rolled freezers stocked with the last frozen chickens in town out of the supermarkets and down the main roads.', '“It was insane,” said Oleksandr Samoylenko, a politician and head of Kherson’s regional council, who left when the Russians invaded. “Kherson was under Russian occupation but the Russians weren’t interested in taking over the administration — the water, the sales things, the markets. They didn’t want the headache.”', 'Mr. Karamalikov, 51, stepped in. Along with some other city leaders, he organized the Citizen Patrol: 1,200 men, mostly unarmed, some with sticks, who prowled Kherson’s streets after dark. They arrested curfew violators and petty criminals, sometimes making them pick up garbage or perform other community service. It was a short-lived, grass-roots criminal justice system.', 'Mr. Karamalikov had something of a godfather reputation in his city. At nearly six feet tall, stocky and well connected across business and politics, he owned two popular nightclubs, Amigo and Shade, and several grocery stores. He was known as a man who would engage anyone in the interests of doing business and he rubbed some people the wrong way.', '“I don’t think he’s honest or altruistic and I’ll say it to his face,” said Mr. Samoylenko.', 'But in Kherson’s small Jewish community, the remnant of what was once a major strand in this city’s fabric, Mr. Karamalikov was widely respected. Before the Holocaust, Rabbi Wolff said, Kherson had 26 temples. Now there is only one left, Kherson’s Chabad Synagogue, and Mr. Karamalikov regularly allowed it to use his nightclub space for free.', '“He never said no,” Rabbi Wolff said.', 'Mr. Karamalikov was busy during those first chaotic weeks of the war, his lawyer said — rushing around Kherson in his white Audi, checking on neighborhood patrols, stopping by the synagogue and turning his businesses into de facto aid depots where he handed out cartons of supplies.', 'This brought him face to face with Russian officers, in particular a colonel who dressed in all black and went by the code name Alpha. Mr. Karamalikov had little choice, his lawyer said. Jumpy Russian troops were spread across the city and Mr. Karamalikov needed to talk to Russian commanders like Alpha “to make sure they didn’t shoot any of the volunteers.”', 'Around 10 p.m. on March 15, a plumber, a carpenter and the carpenter’s son were standing at a checkpoint when they saw the silhouette of someone flitting in and out of the shadows. A voice then yelled out: “I’m one of you!” and out stepped the Russian soldier, who had mistaken the neighborhood watchmen for fellow Russians.', 'Andriy Skvortsov, the carpenter’s son, said the soldier was bewildered and barely able to string a sentence together. When he realized the men in front of him were Ukrainians, he looked extremely frightened, Mr. Skvortsov said. “He was childlike and helpless,” Mr. Skvortsov said. And he was heavily armed.', 'When they patted him down they found one short-barreled AK-47, one Makarov officer’s pistol and five ammunition magazines. They also found his military identification card showing he was Lieutenant Dmitrii Pavlovich Savchenko, 32, a combat helicopter pilot. From his discombobulated speech, they pieced together that he had walked nearly 10 miles from Kherson’s airport, which the Ukrainians had just shelled, killing many Russians.', 'The watchmen took the soldier to a school and called Mr. Karamalikov. There was no easy solution. The Red Cross, which handles prisoner issues, was not operating in Kherson at the time, and there was no way to get the captured pilot to Ukrainian forces, who were miles away.', 'Despite all the anti-Russian feeling coursing through Kherson, the civilian guards did not mistreat the soldier. A small crowd, curious, gathered around him and some took selfies. Mr. Karamalikov’s lawyer said that his client was determined to treat the soldier humanely and what he ultimately did was in accord with the Geneva Conventions.', 'Mr. Karamalikov called Alpha and they arranged to meet in the morning. Until then, the soldier would stay at his house. At daybreak, Mr. Karamalikov met Alpha and handed over the Russian soldier.', 'What Mr. Karamalikov didn’t know, his lawyer said, was that Ukrainian intelligence agents had tapped Alpha’s phone and heard the whole discussion.', 'By mid-April, the Russians had imported hundreds of intelligence agents and other security officers into Kherson who arrested many civilians and tortured some of them. At the same time, Ukrainian security services had their own network of informants in the city and were keeping tabs on anyone suspected of collaborating with the Russians.', 'Mr. Karamalikov decided it was time to go. On April 14, he packed his wife, his mother-in-law and three of his five children into two cars to drive 150 miles to Odesa, a Ukrainian-controlled city. ', 'As soon as they crossed into Ukrainian territory, they were stopped. Ukrainian intelligence agents pulled Mr. Karamalikov out of his car and took him away. His family and lawyer said he was brought to an interrogation center in Kryvyi Rih, beaten all over his body, cut with sharp objects on his legs and injected with drugs and forced to talk.', 'Officials in Kherson declined to comment on the allegations of torture, but acknowledged that at least two of the agents involved in the treatment of Mr. Karamalikov have been placed under investigation.', '“It’s hard to believe that our own country, which is committed to democracy and has its own laws, would do this,” his son Artem, 19, said in a phone interview.', 'In the indictment, prosecutors said that by releasing the soldier, Mr. Karamalikov “organized the further participation of a Russian serviceman in aggression against Ukraine.” They also charged him with leaking personnel data on military veterans and pro-Ukrainian political figures. His lawyer said he didn’t do that and that the information was already publicly available.', 'Prosecutors also accused him of “producing a positive image” of Russia by distributing Russian humanitarian aid and helping make Russian propaganda videos, which his lawyer denied.', 'But the crux of the case, his lawyer said, was the captured soldier and “to this day we have asked a question that no one can answer: What else, in those circumstances, in that city, at that time, was he supposed to do?”', 'The Kherson prosecutor’s office declined to respond to that.', 'Shane Darcy, an international law professor at the Irish Center for Human Rights of the University of Galway, has been following media reports on collaborator investigations in Ukraine, including the Karamalikov case. “It sounds like as collaboration, this was a particularly innocuous example, handing over a dazed and confused soldier,” Mr. Darcy said. But, he added, “it’s not for me to define for the Ukrainians what they consider collaboration.”', 'Mr. Samoylenko, the local politician, said that despite his misgivings about Mr. Karamalikov’s integrity, the decision to hand over the pilot was “absolutely right.”', '“There was nothing else you could do,” he said, adding that it would have been dangerous for everyone involved to keep him as a prisoner.', 'Even after all that has unfolded in Kherson in the past nine months, Mr. Skvortsov, the watchman, seems deeply moved by what happened that night.', '“We wondered later: Should we have killed the soldier and kept it secret?” he said. “But I’ve decided no, that wouldn’t have been good.”', '“I remember seeing the bodies and the body parts at the beginning of the war, ours and theirs,” he said. “We did the right thing.”']"

Putin of Russia about a possible peace agreement in Ukraine, the Kremlin offered a frosty response, and prospects for settling the brutal conflict remained as distant as ever.', 'Mr. Biden said on Thursday that he would hold his first conversation with Mr. Putin since before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 if the Russian leader was “looking for a way to end the war.” But U.S. officials said that Russia, as they have previously assessed, was not prepared to negotiate in good faith, and Russian officials repeated hard-line demands that are unacceptable to Kyiv.', 'Although Mr. Biden’s remark was taken by some as a new emphasis on moving toward peace talks with Russia, John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters that Mr. Biden’s position had not changed.', '“The president has been very consistent about that,” Mr. Kirby said. “He’s got no intentions to talk to Mr. Putin right now. As he also said, Putin has shown absolutely no inclination to be interested in dialogue of any kind. In fact, quite the contrary. Everything he’s doing shows that Mr. Putin is interested in continuing this illegal, unprovoked war.”', 'In Moscow, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said at a news conference on Friday that Mr. Putin remained “open to contacts and negotiations” and that diplomacy was the “preferable way” to achieve Russia’s goals.', 'But Mr. Peskov noted that the United States “still does not recognize new territories as part of Russia,” an apparent reference to eastern Ukrainian regions that Mr. Putin claimed to annex after sham referendums in September, saying that “this makes more complicated the search for common ground for mutual discussions.”', 'In fact, the Russian position essentially rules out serious negotiations with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who said in a mid-November interview with Bloomberg News that the war could not end until Ukraine had reclaimed all its territory from Russia, including the purportedly annexed regions as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.', '“The Russians have made it very clear that, of course, they are not in the mood for constructive dialogue and for constructive diplomacy,” the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said at a press briefing. Any conversation between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin “is nothing more than a hypothetical at this time,” he added.', '“We have been very clear that the United States and countries around the world will never — never, never, never — recognize territory that Russia has illegally annexed, either in 2014 or more recently, as part of its illegal and now brutal aggression against Ukraine,” Mr. Price added.', 'Mr. Biden’s comment — made during a news conference with the visiting President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has spoken to Mr. Putin several times over the past year, including in late August — follows some signs that senior U.S. officials have contemplated whether Ukraine’s recent successful offensives present a window for negotiations. Last month, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark A. Milley, told reporters that Ukraine’s position of “strength” creates “a possibility” for a political solution.', 'But Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who served as NATO secretary general from 2009 to 2014, said this week during a visit to Washington that he had spoken with Biden administration officials and saw no sign that they were pressuring Ukraine’s government to begin negotiating with Russia.', '“It was an idea that was just floated, but it has been immediately shut down,” Mr. Rasmussen said. “It would really weaken the Western front if we tried to push Zelensky into premature peace negotiations, because that would be a trap.”', '“Putin is not sincere when it comes to peace negotiations,” Mr. Rasmussen added.', 'Ukrainian officials have said the same, warning that Russia could try to pause the fighting for talks — but only to use that time to prepare for new military offensives.', 'Mr. Macron reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine and nodded to the reality that a Ukrainian population enraged by Russia’s occupation is in no mood to compromise. France “will never urge Ukrainians to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them,” he said.', 'On Friday, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said that Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure targets like power grids were “making any kind of dialogue impossible.”', '“We all want peace, but it must come through Kyiv’s independence, not through its surrender,” Mr. Tajani said. “The responsibility for this situation is only Russian. Now the Kremlin must give concrete signals instead of bombing the population.”', 'White House officials said they were not surprised by Russia’s reaction to Mr. Biden’s comments. Few on the president’s national security team expected anything different from Mr. Putin, given Russia’s behavior in the past several weeks, which has included strikes on infrastructure targets that have deprived major cities including Kyiv of heat, light and running water.', '“This brutalization of Ukraine’s people is barbaric,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a NATO meeting in Romania on Wednesday.', 'Mr. Biden’s remark about speaking to Mr. Putin was not intended, the officials said, to signal a shift in policy or to indicate that the president was drifting from his commitment to ensuring that Ukraine’s leadership decided when and how to negotiate an end to the war.', 'Aides say the president continues to believe that negotiations will be necessary. But they also say he does not believe that direct talks with Mr. Putin will be possible unless the “facts on the ground” change.', 'In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Biden was careful to show deference to Ukraine and the NATO allies, saying he would talk to Mr. Putin only after consulting with them first.', 'In part, the message was intended to be a show of support for diplomacy by his counterparts. Mr. Macron has stressed the importance of maintaining dialogue with the Russian leader, if only to avoid dangerous escalation or miscalculation. He called Mr. Putin in August and plans to speak with him in a few days. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, spoke to the Russian president on Friday morning.', 'A Kremlin readout of the call with Mr. Scholz blamed the West for the absence of talks, saying that the Western approach of “pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons” and providing it with financial and political support “leads Kyiv to reject any idea of negotiations.”', 'But there are other audiences to consider as well. Some leaders are anxious about the economic impacts of a war that has driven up food and energy prices worldwide. And in the United States, some Republican and progressive Democratic lawmakers have expressed frustration that the Biden administration, which has provided nearly $20 billion in military aid to Kyiv since the Russian invasion, appears to be writing “blank checks” without describing an end game for the conflict.', 'White House officials said the president’s comment about being willing to meet with Mr. Putin under certain circumstances was not directly aimed at those groups. But the remark nonetheless signals that the Biden administration has not foreclosed the possibility of diplomacy, even though Mr. Biden has not spoken to Mr. Putin since mid-February.', 'Mr. Blinken has spoken to his counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, only once since mid-January, to discuss the potential release of two Americans imprisoned in Russia, Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. Mr. Biden also said in October that he would be willing to talk with Mr. Putin about releasing the two Americans.', 'Speaking a day before Mr. Biden’s comments, Mr. Rasmussen, the former NATO chief, said he did not believe that Ukraine would accept a peace deal that allowed Russia to occupy any part of its territory.', '“I can conclude quite confidently that as long as you will see Russian troops on Ukrainian soil, you will have a conflict,” he said. “The only off-ramp for Putin is, get out of Ukraine.”']"

Mr. Macron immediately had the history that drew him to New Orleans thrown in his face as he strolled down St. Peter’s Street, off Jackson Square.', '“You idiot, you sold Louisiana for a mouthful of bread!” said Esther Dahan, raised in Casablanca and a fluent French speaker, as Mr. Macron shook her hand.', '“I know,” the president said, smiling a little wistfully and shaking his head.', 'Ms. Dahan was referring to the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 under which a vast sweep of territory was sold by France to the United States for a little over $27 million. The sale, at about 3 cents an acre, nearly doubled the size of the United States and propelled the young country toward becoming a continental power.', 'On the elaborate ironwork balconies of the French Quarter, crowds waved at Mr. Macron. Some yelled “Allez Les Bleus!” — a reference to the French World Cup soccer team, now qualified for the round of 16. Asked why she thought Mr. Macron had come here, Denise Minvielle, descended from French grandparents, said: “Because it’s the best place on earth!”', 'Several cities, including Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles, had been considered as possible second destinations during the visit, French officials said. But Mr. Macron, with his strong sense of history, favored New Orleans, last visited by a French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, in 1976.', 'With relatively new leaders governing in Germany, Italy and Britain, Mr. Macron, 44, is as close to the doyen of European politics as anyone gets, his restlessness and questing mind a stimulus to some, a provocation to others.', 'One minute he insists that Russia must one day become part of Europe’s “strategic architecture,” the next he dwells on the unacceptable, “imperial” aggression of President Vladimir V. Putin, which must never be allowed to stand. One minute he declares NATO “brain dead,” as he did in 2019, the next he hails the inviolable strength of the alliance.', 'On this visit, he went in just two days from suggesting Mr. Biden’s economic policies could “fragment the West” because subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act constitute unfair competition, to saying differences would be worked out and Franco-American friendship was unbreakable.', 'He is forever testing new ideas and changing tack. He is not called the “at-the-same-time” president for nothing. His disruption since becoming French leader at the age of 39 has virtually destroyed the center-left and center-right parties that were the foundation of postwar French politics — the Socialists and the Republicans.', 'But having lost his parliamentary majority in the April elections, and lost his sheen to many French people after bursting on the scene in 2017, he has been casting around for political direction as the Ukraine war and fruitless attempts to end it occupy much of his time.', 'A warm American reception and unexpected, if highly conditional, backing from Mr. Biden for his outreach to Mr. Putin, have therefore been particularly welcome. He can now go home to Paris with his diplomacy at least partially vindicated and America’s oldest alliance reaffirmed.', 'Mr. Macron has been relentlessly attacked in France, by the left for favoring the rich and proposing to raise the retirement age progressively to 65 from 62; and by the right for being soft on immigration. In the United States, however, he has gone a long way toward overcoming tensions over the economy and how best to end the war.', 'Welcoming Mr. Macron in midafternoon on Thursday to a long delayed lunch at the State Department, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken deadpanned: “Good evening.”', 'When the laughter subsided, he described the French leader standing next to him, as a man of “exceptional vision” and “a galvanizing force for all of us, all of our partners. We could not do without it.”', 'Just how much of a political animal Mr. Macron is was quickly apparent at the lunch hosted by Mr. Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris. Dispensing with notes, speaking in English, explaining that his meeting with President Biden took three hours because “we fixed everything,” Mr. Macron composed an improvised hymn to the “unique bond” between the United States and France.', 'If some people find the two countries “too proud or too self-confident,” Mr. Macron suggested, it was because “we absolutely believe we are charged with protecting certain universal values,” like the liberty that young American soldiers defended as they died on European soil “they had never known before.”', '“We will never forget that,” he said.', 'At the delayed lunch, Mr. Macron also thanked the United States for its “unequaled commitment and investment” in supporting the people of Ukraine at the approach of winter. From the leading proponent of European “strategic autonomy,” an idea that has sometimes irked the Biden administration, this appeared to be a particularly generous endorsement of America’s vital role in Europe.', 'From the war, Mr. Macron turned to domestic politics, noting what he called the “resurgence of racism and hate speech” in Western societies. He thanked the United States for turning away from “the demagogues.” ', 'In all his backs-and-forth, Mr. Macron has never wavered on one thing: the central importance of the fight against far-right nationalism and the French commitment to the European Union, a bulwark of postwar democracy and freedom on the continent. As the United States lurched to former president Donald Trump, and Britain to Brexit, he stood twice between France and a victory of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party.', 'This was particularly important to Mr. Biden, who likes to say that the world is at a tipping point between democracy and rising autocracy.', 'While in New Orleans, Mr. Macron met with Elon Musk.

In addition, he directed the government to conduct an inquiry into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its ties to Moscow, “and, if necessary, to take measures provided for by law.”', 'But he did not elaborate on how a new law would work — whether, for example, the church would be judged as one or parish by parish — and how it would be enforced. Several religious and legal scholars said it could face legal challenges, and without seeing more detail, they were not sure how the government would proceed.', 'Mr. Zelensky’s plans may be popular with an increasingly anti-Russian populace after months of Russian bombardment, but they raise hard questions about what it means to be a collaborator in a nation at war, and how a ban on the church would square with freedom of religion under the Ukrainian Constitution.', 'For centuries the ancient Ukrainian branch of the church has been subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church, based in Moscow. The leader of the Russian church, Patriarch Kirill, has strong ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, whose long tenure he has called “a miracle of God,” and has endorsed the invasion.', 'But that branch of Orthodoxy is rapidly losing support, while many Ukrainians now adhere to a newer Orthodox church, based in Kyiv, created specifically to be independent and not answer to Moscow. There is little difference between the two churches in terms of religious practice or doctrine, but the divide between them on Ukraine and its identity relative to Russia is wide — and widening.', 'Officials in Russia were quick to condemn Mr. Zelensky’s move.', '“The current Ukrainian authorities have openly become enemies of Christ and the Orthodox faith,” Dmitry A. Medvedev, a Russian former president and a top adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin, who has described Ukraine’s leaders as Nazis and satanists, wrote on Friday on the Telegram app. A spokesman for the Russian church, Vladimir Legoyda, wrote on Telegram that Mr. Zelensky’s proposal violated both international law and common sense.', 'Kyiv has long worried that Russia is using the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to provide cover for a network of clandestine agents trying to undermine Ukraine from within. The Ukrainian authorities have said that as of October, 33 priests had been arrested for assisting Russia since the invasion began in February, mostly by funneling information to Moscow’s forces.', 'The security services have questioned religious leaders and raided monasteries they said were suspected of harboring saboteurs and their gear — though they have not said if any were found — and have interrogated scores of religious leaders. They claimed to have found “literature that denies the existence of the Ukrainian people, its language, as well as the very right of Ukraine to statehood,” and videos have emerged of Orthodox priests chanting pro-Russian slogans.', 'But the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has called the accusations of collaboration between its clergy and Russia “unproven and groundless.” The church formally opposed the war and distanced itself from Moscow earlier this year, but is still under the jurisdiction of Patriarch Kirill in Moscow.', 'Sounding much like Mr. Putin, Kirill has argued that Ukraine is not a truly separate nation, that Russia has a legitimate claim on lands beyond its borders, and that the invasion is a justified defense against Western liberalism. In Moscow on Friday, he spoke of Donbas, the partly Russian-occupied region of Ukraine where the war for control still rages.', '“Today, Donbas is the front line of defense of the Russian world,” he said, according to the Tass news agency. “And the Russian world is not only Russia — it is everywhere where people who were brought up in the traditions of Orthodoxy and in the traditions of Russian morality live.”', 'In his overnight address, Mr. Zelensky drew a parallel between the church split, and Ukraine breaking away from the Soviet Union in 1991 and its continuing struggle to be free of Moscow’s control. “Ukrainians will never again be gears of some empires,” he said and added, “We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul.”', 'Ukraine’s Constitution guarantees “the right to freedom of personal philosophy and religion,” including the right “to perform alone or collectively and without constraint religious rites and ceremonial rituals, and to conduct religious activity.” But it also allows for restrictions on that right “in the interest of protecting public order.”', 'If Ukraine does outlaw a religious group, it would be among dozens of countries that have done so, but most are authoritarian states that are a far cry from the kind of liberal democracy Ukraine presents itself as being. The list includes Russia, which has proscribed the Jehovah’s Witnesses, among others, as extremists.', '“We are not Russia, that can just forbid religious organizations,” said Ihor Kozlovsky, a theologian at the Shevchenko Scientific Society, a Ukrainian and American group based in New York.', 'The president’s declaration, he said, was meant to send a clear message to the church leadership to decide “if they are a church of the Ukrainian people” or advocates for the Russian worldview.', 'Nicholas Denysenko, a professor of theology at Valparaiso University in Indiana, said the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was struggling to occupy a “gray area.” It condemned the war in May, but has not repudiated the leadership in Moscow.', 'The government, Mr. Denysenko said, is saying, “You really need to decide whose side you’re on.”', 'About two-thirds of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christians in public opinion surveys. That figure has not changed much in decades, but the breakdown has, with steadily fewer people stating allegiance to the branch directed by Moscow, a growing number adhering to the independent Ukrainian church, and many calling themselves simply Orthodox, without naming a branch.', 'The shifting allegiances have significantly diminished the flock under the Russian Orthodox umbrella, much of which historically has been in Ukraine. Russians are, on the whole, less likely than Ukrainians to identify as religious and as Orthodox.', 'In 2019, international Orthodox leaders formally recognized the Orthodox Church of Ukraine as independent, a move bitterly opposed by the Russian church. Thousands of parishes have switched allegiances to the new branch, though thousands more remain loyal to Moscow.', 'In April, a survey found that 74 percent of Ukrainians wanted the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to cut its ties with Russia, and 51 percent wanted that church banned.', 'The Orthodox churches in both countries share the same religious rituals, abide by the same creed and trace their origins to the same event in 988, in Kyivan Rus, the east Slavic state that both Russia and Ukraine consider the root of their modern countries.

Russian airstrikes have knocked out power and other utilities, depriving households of electricity, heating and water.  The attacks are raising fears about a collapse of Ukraine’s energy grid, which would push many vulnerable Ukrainians to the brink.  ', 'For more insight on the crisis, I spoke to Denise Brown, the U.N.’s resident coordinator in Ukraine, who is responsible for overseeing the international humanitarian response. Denise took up her position in August and has since been traveling around the country to see how people are coping. Our conversation has been condensed and edited. ', 'Denise, let’s start with your recent travels. Where have you been, and what is the situation there? ', 'In the past two weeks, I’ve been to Kherson twice, Mykolaiv and the Sumy region. ', 'In Kherson, two weeks ago, I saw empty grocery stores, there was nothing, not a crumb. Supply chains were disrupted. Many older people were still there and were very happy to see us.  You could sense their relief. ', 'When I was back there this past Sunday, it was different. First of all, it was much colder. They are re-establishing the power lines, but because of the mines, progress is slow. Electricity is linked to water, which is linked to heating, so it was cold. ', 'There were three grocery stores open. And the one that was empty two weeks ago was full, and there were 500 people waiting to get into the grocery store. I felt that after the hope and relief two weeks earlier, people were worried, extremely worried.  ', 'What is the biggest humanitarian concern heading into winter? ', 'What I worry about is the damage to the energy infrastructure. We knew that winter was coming. In our humanitarian response plan, there’s a very specific component dedicated to winter. We planned for that. But it’s the damage to the energy infrastructure which is the new dimension, which is overwhelming and which gives all of us cause to worry. The humanitarian community has been reaching 13 million people since the war started. As the energy infrastructure damage grows, if, at some point it all disappears, what then? That’s the question.  ', 'The generators are super, super important. How many generators can we bring in to run the hospitals, to run the heating centers, to run everything? How many can everybody bring in? From our humanitarian community, we believe we can bring in 2,000. And the spare parts that have been requested that have to come from outside the country to keep the system up and running.  It’s an absolute primary objective: To keep people safe, you need electricity, water and heating. That’s the biggest worry, everybody’s biggest worry. ', 'Where are the most vulnerable? ', 'I think right now it is the Kherson, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. The data that we have suggests that, which is why I spend most of my time going back and forth to these areas. When we go to these areas, we see a lot of elderly people, who didn’t have the means to move or didn’t want to leave their homes behind. We also worry about women alone with children.  We worry a lot about people with disabilities who may be on their own. We tend to focus a lot on those groups, to provide them with support not just materially, but also psychologically. ', 'People have been living in communities under temporary Russian control. On the faces of people, I see stress and anxiety. I’ve been greeted by screams and cries in some places. ', 'Moving forward,  there will be huge gaps if the energy structure collapses. The worst-case scenario from my point of view is people left on their own: the elderly, women with children, people with disabilities. We need to make sure we know where they are. If we don’t, that’s a big problem. The linkage to local organizations is key.  Because they are present in those areas.

The threshold, which was settled on after protracted negotiations among European Union diplomats, is likely to make a small dent in the Kremlin’s energy revenue and, the White House hopes, help avert a global oil shock.', 'The deal was heralded by the E.U.’s executive body and won the quick approval of the rest of the G7 and Australia late on Friday.', '“With this decision today, we deliver on the commitment of G7 Leaders at their summit in Elmau to prevent Russia from profiting from its war of aggression against Ukraine, to support stability in global energy markets and to minimize negative economic spillovers of Russia’s war of aggression, especially on low- and middle-income countries, who have felt the impacts of Putin’s war disproportionately,” the joint statement said.', 'The final agreement came after months of deliberations over how to keep economic pressure on Russia without creating an oil price shock that will cause a global recession. Negotiators in Europe worked through the week to settle on a price for the cap, completing it with little time to spare before an embargo on Russian oil takes effect on Monday.', '“This price cap has three objectives: First, it strengthens the effect of our sanctions. Second, it will further diminish Russia’s revenues, and thirdly, at the same time, it will stabilize global energy markets,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, shortly after the deal became final.', 'The United States praised the agreement and said it would curtail Russia’s ability to fund the war.', '“Together, the G7, European Union, and Australia have now jointly set a cap on the price of seaborne Russian oil that will help us achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies,” said Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen.', 'The price threshold reflects what American officials have long said is their primary goal in pushing the plan: to keep millions of barrels of Russian oil flowing to the global market as a new wave of European sanctions on Russian oil exports takes effect, avoiding a sudden contraction in supply that could send gasoline and heating fuel prices soaring in the United States and around the world.', 'The limit of $60 a barrel seeks to lock in the steep discount that buyers of Russian oil are now able to pay relative to other sources of oil on the world market. While not dramatically slashing Russian export revenue, which is crucial to its war effort in Ukraine, it could still dent Russia’s finances. The cap will come with light-touch enforcement, but European allies agreed that it would be followed swiftly with a fresh round of sanctions against Russia.', 'Settling on the price has not been easy. European Union ambassadors in Brussels met many times over the past two weeks to discuss the cap, with some countries arguing for a much lower price than $60 and others urging a higher cap.. They settled on a price that reflects what Russia has recently sold its oil to countries like India and China for — between $60 and $65 a barrel.', 'Oil traders appeared to view the plan as a sign that a European Union embargo on Russian oil imports, which takes effect on Dec. 5, is unlikely to knock much, if any, Russian oil off the global market. Global oil prices fell on news of the cap and are down about 10 percent from a month ago. Biden administration officials call that proof the cap was already working to deny Russia the premium oil prices it enjoyed earlier this year.', 'E.U. diplomats agreed that the price should be reviewed every two months, or more frequently if needed, by a committee of policymakers from Group of 7 countries and allies. The first review would happen on Jan. 15, and the goal is to keep the cap at least 5 percent lower than the price Russian oil is being traded at the market, officials said. This approach will ensure that fluctuations in the market price, using the International Energy Agency’s price as a benchmark, will be followed by fluctuations in the price cap.', 'The G7 statement said that changes to the price would be enacted with a grace period to minimize disruption to oil markets. Acknowledging that the policy is a work in progress, the coalition said it would “consider further action to ensure the effectiveness of the price cap.”', 'That plan places the burden of putting into effect and policing the price cap on the businesses that help sell the oil: global shipping and insurance companies, which are mostly based in Europe.', 'The European Union embargo on Russian oil includes a ban on European services to ship, finance or insure Russian oil shipments to destinations outside the bloc, a measure that would disable the infrastructure that moves Russia’s oil to buyers around the world.', 'Some 55 percent of the tankers that transport Russian oil out of the country are Greek-owned, for example, according to maritime data and analysis by the Institute of International Finance. ', 'To apply the price cap, these European shipping providers will instead be permitted to transport Russian crude outside the bloc only if the shipment complies with the price cap. It will up to them to ensure that the Russian oil they are transporting or insuring has been sold at or below the capped price; otherwise, the providers would be held legally liable for violating sanctions.', '“The good news is that the West now has equipped itself with an important tool to exercise pressure on Putin,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Brussels think tank Bruegel.', 'Russia has repeatedly said it will ignore the policy and refuse to sell oil under a price cap; setting the level near the market price could help Moscow avoid looking like it is caving.', 'Earlier this year, economic forecasters expressed concerns that Russia taking oil off the market could send gasoline prices in the United States above $7 a gallon by the end of the year.', '“Our motives are to hold down Russia’s revenues to impede its ability to fight the war,” Ms. Yellen said in an interview last month. “And second, to make sure that there’s enough global supply of oil that global oil prices don’t jump, because that would both exacerbate inflation and would likely cause a recession.”', 'American officials have been celebrating the imposition of the cap. “A lot of people doubted the resolve of the G7 and Europe in particular,” Ben Harris, the assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department, said in an interview. But, he said, the cap would help stabilize markets: “Sometimes you don’t get credit for the crisis avoided.”', 'The protracted talks in Brussels were evidence of the discord the cap has sown in Europe. For most of the process, E.U. officials and diplomats from some member countries worked to ameliorate two types of concerns.', 'One group of three E.U. maritime nations — Greece, Cyprus and Malta — demanded the price cap be placed very high, at or above $70 a barrel, to ensure that their business interests would not be disrupted. Another group of three hard-line pro-Ukraine countries — Estonia, Lithuania and Poland — demanded an ultralow cap, at or around $30 a barrel, to drastically slash the Kremlin’s oil revenue, no matter the disruption that would cause on the global oil markets.', 'The benchmark for the price of Russian oil, known as the Urals blend, traded from $60 to $70 a barrel in the year before the pandemic, close to global benchmark prices. A discount worth more than 20 percent to global prices opened up shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, but Russia was still able to sell Urals crude for around $100 a barrel at the post-invasion peak.', 'Since then, global oil prices have fallen while Russia signed agreements to sell its oil at a further discount to China, India and others. Those falling prices have strained Moscow’s finances, at least to some degree.']"

So Gazprom and German officials concocted a phony climate foundation to get the job done.,"['SCHWERIN, Germany — Between a tram stop and a kebab shop, the gray building in the northeastern German city of Schwerin looks innocuous enough — and so does its tenant, the Foundation for the Protection of the Climate and Environment.', 'Yet this regional foundation, created 23 months ago by the local state government, has done little for the climate. Instead, it served as a conduit for at least 165 million euros from the Kremlin-owned energy company Gazprom to build one of the world’s most contested gas pipelines: Nord Stream 2.', 'The United States in 2020 was threatening sanctions against any company working on the pipeline. The thinking was that putting companies under the umbrella of a foundation would deter Washington from imposing the penalties because it would then effectively be targeting a German government body.', 'So the climate foundation helped companies lease port space to service a Russian pipe-laying vessel, bought a multimillion-dollar rock-laying freighter and brokered a host of other transactions.', '“Mission accomplished,” the head of the foundation, Erwin Sellering, a former state governor, wrote on its website in January, celebrating the pipeline’s completion.', 'Any feeling of celebration ended a month later, however, after Russian troops swept into Ukraine, an invasion that forced a national reckoning about German complicity in Moscow’s ambitions. The climate foundation is now under investigation by the state parliament, and it has become a case study of how far some German leaders were willing to go to keep cheap Russian gas flowing.', '“This is as crazy as it gets — that a German government authority is taking money from Gazprom to complete the pipeline Gazprom can’t complete because they are under U.S. sanctions,” said Constantin Zerger of DUH, a prominent German environmental watchdog.', 'Activists like him had questioned the point of the pipeline from the start. Germany already got 55 percent of its gas supply through another direct pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 1.', 'Today Nord Stream 2 is all but dead politically — and also damaged by a mysterious explosion in September. Yet not long ago German leaders argued that Russian gas was a strategic national interest and dismissed geopolitical concerns about the pipeline raised by the United States, Poland and other countries. The pipeline was a priority for Moscow and Berlin alike, with German officials from both major parties acting as eager cheerleaders.', 'Nowhere was that more obvious than in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, one of Germany’s poorest states and once part of the former Communist East, where both pipelines come ashore. Older generations there grew up on Soviet culture, and still remember when America was the enemy and Moscow the protector. ', 'Mr. Sellering and his successor as governor, Manuela Schwesig, were allies of former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a fellow Social Democrat, personal friend of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and lobbyist for Russian energy companies.', 'Mr. Schröder’s conservative successor, Angela Merkel, whose constituency was in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, approved Nord Stream 2 after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, and defended it even after Moscow hacked the German Parliament, assassinated a Chechen rebel in central Berlin and poisoned the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.', 'Before the war, the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called Nord Stream 2 a “private-sector project” and last year, when he was finance minister, he personally wrote to his U.S. counterpart to demand a stop to sanctions. (In October, Mr. Scholz claimed that he “was always sure” that Mr. Putin would “use energy supplies as a weapon.”)', 'Both Mr. Scholz and Ms. Merkel knew of the climate foundation. Neither of them spoke out against it, nor apparently minded as Moscow invested generously in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and reactivated Cold War networks, including former spies, to deliver on the pipeline.', '“We see Russia’s influence on European politics in the microcosm of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania,” said Claudia Müller, a Green lawmaker from the state. “It is the most successful example.”', 'In October 2014, seven months after Russia illegally annexed Crimea, Mr. Sellering, then governor of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, hosted the state’s first “Russia Day.”', 'A networking bonanza sponsored by Gazprom and Nord Stream, it was held in the Hotel Neptun, still called the “Stasi hotel” for its reputation as a hub of the former East German secret police.', 'The guest list included ex-spies, notably Matthias Warnig, the managing director of Nord Stream AG, which built and operated Nord Stream 1. In 1988, he won a Stasi medal for services recruiting Western spies. Now, he was recruiting German supporters for a second Russian pipeline. (His communications director, Steffen Ebert, was a former Stasi informer whose code name was “Bull.”)', 'Even then, Mr. Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine cast a shadow over Nord Stream 2. Ms. Merkel led the first Western sanctions against Russia that spring over its annexation of Crimea, though they stopped short of cutting off Russian gas.', 'Andrey Zverev, then Russia’s deputy ambassador, told the German newspaper Die Welt that year that a “relaxed dialogue” with Berlin had become impossible. Instead, he said, Moscow was focusing its efforts “one level down.”', 'The example he cited was “Russia Day.”', 'The lobbying paid off. By the time the state’s next Russia Day came in 2016, Berlin had approved Nord Stream 2. It would land in Lubmin, a tiny coastal village where the Nord Stream 1 pipeline had pumped out Russian gas since 2011. Lubmin’s mayor, Axel Vogt, was thrilled. Nord Stream was already donating €3,000 a year to village coffers, and paid millions of euros in taxes.', 'As construction began, Poland warned that Moscow could weaponize control over Europe’s gas supplies, a concern other allies began to share.', 'In 2019, the United States placed sanctions on Gazprom and other Russian companies working on Nord Stream 2. Congress then floated the idea of the so-called extraterritorial sanctions, targeting any company — even outside Russia — working to finish the pipeline.', 'Though never enacted, the mere threat was enough to jeopardize the pipeline, which was 90 percent complete. The Swiss-Dutch contractor Allseas withdrew its pipe-laying ships. The project ground to a halt.', 'Germany was outraged, and feelings were particularly bitter in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.', '“To many people here, America was the bully,” said Mr. Vogt, Lubmin’s mayor, who grew up studying Russian. “It wants to sell its own oil and gas.”', 'That view was only reinforced when a letter from three powerful Republican senators landed on Aug. 5, 2020.', 'Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin warned of “crushing legal and economic sanctions” if local German companies continued working on the project.', '“This wasn’t just advice,” said Frank Kracht, the mayor of Sassnitz, home to the Mukran port that was one of the state hubs helping to build the pipeline. “This was a threat.”', 'German leaders were infuriated.', 'Ms. Merkel, then chancellor, said the pipeline should be finished. Mr. Scholz, then finance minister, wrote to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and proposed “unhindered construction and operation of Nord Stream 2” in return for investing up to €1 billion in terminals to import U.S. gas. Washington refused.', 'Less than two weeks later, Mr. Warnig, by now the chief executive of Nord Stream 2, pulled up outside the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state house, carrying a bouquet. It was the first of several meetings with the governor, Ms. Schwesig, about how to work around the continuing threat of U.S. sanctions, according to a list of meetings the state was forced to release to Parliament.', 'A month later, in September, they had a three-hour dinner with former Chancellor Schröder.', 'It was then that the idea of a state-backed foundation arose as a means to shield companies.', '“There were repeated exchanges in the course of frequent telephone calls with a representative of Nord Stream 2 about whether and how a possible protective umbrella” could be created, Christian Pegel, then the state’s energy minister, told The New York Times. “By the fall, the idea of a foundation had crystallized.”', 'Emails released under Freedom of Information requests from activists and media outlets show that Nord Stream 2 co-wrote the foundation statutes, dictating changes to Ms. Schwesig’s government, and laid down communication guidelines.', 'One email from Mr. Ebert, the Nord Stream 2 communications chief, told the government “to position the foundation with a wink as a ‘smart answer’ to the hard-line behavior of the U.S.A.”', 'But most important was the secretive business arm of the foundation, whose explicit goal was completing the pipeline.', 'Mr. Pegel described the business arm as a “warehouse” — buying and storing supplies that German companies needed to help Russian vessels complete the pipeline, and thus shielding them from possible sanctions.', 'But the foundation went further than that.', 'In the nearby coastal city of Rostock, the foundation financed a company leasing docking space purportedly to service offshore wind power but in fact servicing the Russian ship used to lay pipe. It also spent €18 million to buy and convert the freighter Blue Ship into a rock-laying vessel, according to documents first published by the German newspaper Welt.', 'Blue Ship completed its work in January this year, satellite data shows. By February, under international pressure and two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Chancellor Scholz suspended the project.', 'Nord Stream 2 has never been used.', 'The invasion spawned a long-postponed reckoning for Germany over its ties to Russia.

Many come with a simple battle cry, emblazoned on stickers and banners.', '“Reopen Nord Stream 2.”', 'Many officials, too, remain unconvinced that the pipeline was wrong.', 'Mr. Sellering, the former governor, still rages against “repugnant” U.S. sanctions, insisting what underpinned his foundation’s work was the “belief in Germany’s sovereignty.”', 'Under mounting legal pressure, his foundation disclosed that it had received €192 million from Nord Stream 2, money it used to play middleman in the construction of the pipeline involving 80 companies in 119 transactions worth €165 million.', 'The foundation also confirmed that, for every transaction on Nord Stream 2’s behalf, the foundation earned a 10 percent commission.', 'Mr. Sellering declined to be interviewed by The Times.', 'Since Russia’s invasion, Ms. Schwesig has distanced herself from the pipeline.

Some emails sent to the investigation appear to be missing, while no minutes were taken during some state meetings with Nord Stream 2.', '“How can you hold a government to account that doesn’t document anything?” asked Hannes Damm, a Green Party state lawmaker on the investigating committee.', 'Mr. Damm and other lawmakers are drawing up a list of witnesses that could include not just Ms. Schwesig but two former chancellors, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schröder.', 'But he worries the delays mean the investigation may not conclude before the end of the legislative term in 2026.

Putin, but only in consultation with NATO allies and only if the Russian leader indicated he was “looking for a way to end the war.”', 'Mr. Biden’s public expression of conditioned willingness to reach out to Mr. Putin gratified French officials and provided unexpected support for President Emmanuel Macron’s outreach. Mr. Biden noted that Mr. Putin had shown no interest yet in ending his invasion, but said that if that changed, “I’ll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he has in mind.”', 'Evidently determined to present a united front during a White House news conference that at times resembled a love fest, Mr. Macron said that France would increase its military support for Ukraine and “will never urge Ukrainians to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them.”', 'In effect, the two leaders met each other halfway, with Mr. Biden showing more openness to a negotiated settlement and Mr. Macron more unequivocal support for the Ukrainian cause. If partially choreographed, the meeting of minds appeared to exceed expectations on both sides.', 'It was a significant show of trans-Atlantic unity on the eve of a winter that will put immense strain on the Ukrainian people, as well as pressure on Western economies, especially European states scrambling to find new sources of energy as prices rise sharply.', 'French officials said that during a three-hour closed meeting, Mr. Biden and Mr. Macron agreed that more Ukrainian battlefield gains would constitute important leverage in any talks with Moscow. In practice, the idea of negotiation seems far-fetched at a time when Mr. Putin has nothing he can call victory, and Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has military momentum.', '“I’m not going to do it on my own,” Mr. Biden said of the possibility of talking to Mr. Putin, whose actions in Ukraine he called “sick.”', 'Mr. Macron was effusive in his support of Ukraine and its right to recover its full sovereignty, and there was no hint of his earlier calls for the need to avoid “humiliating” Russia. “If we want sustainable peace, we have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future,” Mr. Macron said.', 'The very friendly tone of the two leaders throughout reflected the ease they have established in several previous meetings. The two leaders, oozing camaraderie, referred to each other as “my friend,” “Emmanuel” and “Dear Joe,” throughout the day.', 'Later, at a lunch in Mr. Macron’s honor at the State Department, Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, laid out the broader significance of the war in Ukraine. Declaring the post-Cold War era over, he said the world was “in a global competition to define what comes next.” In that struggle, he said, the United States and France stood shoulder to shoulder in the defense of liberty and democratic societies.', 'Mr. Macron responded by couching the struggle in Ukraine as one that the United States and France could only feel as part of “our souls and our roots,” in that it involved “fighting for liberty and universal values.”', 'His tone was strikingly different from the one he had chosen on Wednesday, when he sharply criticized Mr. Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act for potentially “killing” European jobs through its massive subsidies for green manufacturing, suggesting that this was a policy that could “fragment the West.”', 'Such fragmentation of the alliance as the war enters its 10th month is precisely what Western leaders are most concerned about avoiding.', 'Mr. Macron’s criticism was sharper than Biden administration officials had expected on the first day of Mr. Macron’s state visit, the first accorded to a foreign leader by the Biden administration.', 'But showing some muscle in the United States is a near necessity for French presidents, who like to say that the mark of the strength of America’s oldest alliance is its capacity to accommodate even marked differences at times.', 'Mr. Macron warned Wednesday of “commercial hostility that could break out in the next several weeks, and we do not need that. What we need is to go hand in hand” — a process the French call “synchronization.”', 'Today, the French president’s concerns seemed to have evaporated as, once again, each leader stretched to accommodate the other’s preoccupations.', 'Mr. Biden said he made “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act and its billions of dollars in government funding for green energy initiatives. But he appeared eager to ease the French concerns, saying that the bill had “glitches” that could be solved. “There’s a lot we can work out,” he said.', 'Of the law that provides tax credits for U.S. automakers that manufacture electric vehicles, among a host of other measures, Mr. Biden said “it was never intended to exclude folks who are cooperating with us.”', 'Mr. Macron also moderated his previous criticisms, saying he had told Mr. Biden of the need to “re-synchronize” their economic partnership to “succeed together.”', 'The combination of the war in Ukraine and the need to transition to carbon-neutral economies to fight climate change has placed great pressure on European economies.', 'The warmth of the two presidents toward each other, and more broadly in celebrating what Mr. Blinken called the “unwavering” friendship between the two countries, came just 14 months after relations collapsed in vitriolic recrimination over a deal Mr. Biden reached with Britain to help Australia build nuclear-powered submarines.', 'Because the deal scuttled an earlier French contract to supply conventional submarines, France saw an “Anglo-Saxon” plot against its interests. Mr. Macron briefly recalled his ambassador to France but relations quickly began to warm again after Mr. Biden called American actions “clumsy.”', 'In a joint statement, the United States said it would support France’s maritime deployments in the Indo-Pacific region and both nations committed to working with China on combating climate change. Here again, past differences seemed to fade as the two leaders agreed to “coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order.”', 'Mr. Macron has in the past suggested the United States was too confrontational toward China and that Europe must carve out a more measured position to ensure, among other things, that Russia not fall into the Chinese camp.', 'The two leaders also said they would focus on the need to bolster Europe’s defense capability.', '“The presidents recognize the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense that contributes positively to trans-Atlantic and global security and is complementary to and interoperable with NATO,” the statement from Mr. Macron and Mr. Biden said.', 'This was an evident concession to Mr. Macron’s overriding conviction that Europe must establish “strategic autonomy,” even if the war in Ukraine and America’s decisive role in providing much-needed weapons to Kyiv have shown that the goal remains a chimera for now. There is no European army.', '“Having the U.S. strongly supporting the Ukrainians in that time is very important not just for Ukrainians, but for the stability of our world today,” Mr. Macron said.', 'For today, autonomy was clearly off the table. On the table at a black-tie state dinner under a tent on the South Lawn of the White House were lobster, caviar and even American cheese (a test of the open-mindedness of the French) in celebration of a relationship in which, as Mr. Biden said, there may be “slight differences, but never in a fundamental way.”']"

They have lost friends and relatives in the fighting; watched as Russian bombs have devastated schools, churches and city streets; and grappled with the anxiety and trauma of war.', 'But the choristers have also forged a determination to use music as a way to heal Ukraine and promote their culture around the world.', 'At Carnegie, the choir’s 56 members — 51 girls and five boys, ages 11 to 25 — will perform traditional songs and carols alongside other Ukrainian artists in “Notes From Ukraine,” a program sponsored in part by the Ukrainian foreign ministry. Proceeds will go to United24, a government-run platform that is raising money to repair damaged infrastructure.', 'The concert will also celebrate the centennial of the North American premiere at Carnegie Hall of “Carol of the Bells,” by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych. (The name of the choir comes from the Ukrainian title for the music.)', 'The choir hopes that the concert will help bring attention to Russia’s continuing attacks, including its recent efforts to damage Ukraine’s supply of electricity, heat and water, threatening a new kind of humanitarian crisis this winter.', '“It has been exhausting,” said Mykhailo Kostyna, a 16-year-old singer. “We’re just happy now that we can share Ukraine’s culture and spirit with the world.”', 'After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, many members of the choir scattered across the country. Some, seeking shelter and security, fled abroad.', 'The choir, which has been a training ground for Ukrainian singers since its founding in 1971, held virtual rehearsals to keep the ensemble together. The choristers stayed in touch on social media, where they shared upbeat songs as well as clips of practice sessions, and checked in on one another.', '“The choir kept my connection to Ukraine alive,” said Taisiia Poliakova, 15, who fled to Germany shortly after the invasion. “It gave me a safe environment amid all the madness of war.”', 'Learning new songs at home was a challenge that provided an escape from the constant ringing of air-raid sirens. It also gave choir members an outlet for the intense emotions they were experiencing.', 'Oleksandra Lutsak, 20, said the war had deeply affected her music. Now, when she sings, she said, she sees the faces of five friends who died in the war. Sometimes, she imagines the experience of a friend captured by Russian soldiers. When rehearsing folk songs, she envisions “destroyed homes with no roofs, collapsed walls, everything burned down — and people standing around who have nowhere to spend the winter.”', '“These songs remind me of the pain,” she said, “but they also help me somehow deal with the pain.”', 'Other singers have struggled to look beyond the chaos of war. Polina Holtseva, 15, said she sometimes felt she was living in a constant state of fear. She was pained to see friends and relatives endure physical injuries and economic hardships because of the conflict.', '“I feel like I’ve suffered so many psychological traumas I can’t even speak of them,” she said. “My nervous system is all over the place. I feel like my whole world has been turned upside down.”', 'In August, the Shchedryk choir reunited for a series of concerts in Copenhagen. Then, this fall, as it prepared for its Carnegie debut, the choir rehearsed in Kyiv for the first time since the start of the war.', 'The recent Russian attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure brought new challenges. Rehearsals were often interrupted by sirens, and frequent power outages meant long stretches without light.', '“It was in those moments that we felt the most responsibility to keep practicing, because this was a testament to our dedication to our craft,” Fedorchenko said.', 'Because of the war, the choir left Ukraine on Nov. 19 for Warsaw, where they were given rehearsal space inside the Chopin University of Music and obtained visas to travel to the United States.', 'Marianna Sablina, the choir’s artistic director and chief conductor, whose mother founded the ensemble, said that the Carnegie concert, which was planned before the invasion, is now “even more momentous, given the struggles we are facing.”', 'The choir is one of several Ukrainian ensembles to go abroad since the invasion, as part of efforts to highlight the country’s cultural identity. The Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra, an ensemble of refugees who fled the war and musicians who stayed behind, toured Europe and the United States in the summer. The Kyiv City Ballet performed in many American cities this fall.', 'The Shchedryk choir arrived in New York this week with a mix of excitement and nervousness, uncertain whether the performance would resonate with an American audience. They brought Ukrainian flags, T-shirts and souvenirs to give to new friends.', 'In New York, they have a busy schedule: rehearsals at local churches as well as visits to tourist destinations including Times Square and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On Wednesday, they gathered at Grand Central Terminal to sing “Carol of the Bells.”', 'Marharyta and Kira Kupchyk, 14-year-old twins from Kyiv, said they felt relieved to have some distance from the war while in New York. But they said they were still growing accustomed to the enormity of the city.', '“In Kyiv, you can walk easier — you can even dance down the streets,” Marharyta said. “But in New York, it’s not like that.”', 'In between rehearsals and sightseeing, the twins checked social media apps for news of the war and sent messages to family and friends in Ukraine. They said they worried about their father, who has been out of touch because he recently started military training in Kyiv.', '“I hope we can help make sure this war will end soon,” Kira said.']"

Workers on the pier said they had recently seen people painting, cleaning and generally keeping the ship with its helipad and six guest staterooms in pristine condition.', 'In past years, such a scene would not have been noteworthy. Many superyachts come and go from Dubai’s Mina Rashid Marina, best known as the home of the Queen Elizabeth 2, the trans-Atlantic ocean liner-turned-hotel that dominates the waterfront here.', 'But Russia’s war in Ukraine has turned an otherwise routine tableau into a diplomatic battleground between the United States and the United Arab Emirates, an important American ally that has established itself as a safe haven for Russian money and assets out of the reach of U.S. sanctions.', 'The $156 million Madame Gu epitomizes the problem. In June, the United States designated the vessel, which is linked to Andrei Skoch, a Russian steel magnate and lawmaker under sanctions, as blocked property. That means the yacht cannot use American companies for its upkeep, employ U.S. citizens or even use the dollar. The Justice Department is now taking steps to seize the Madame Gu, according to people with knowledge of the plan.', 'But the United States can’t seize property in a sovereign nation without permission from its government. The Emirates, which has taken a friendlier position toward Moscow, is balking at cooperating with the United States to pursue oligarchs, American officials said. The Kremlin is also using oligarch-controlled companies in the Emirates to acquire war supplies that the West is trying to keep out of Russia’s reach, according to a Western official involved in the sanctions effort against Russia.', 'Emirati officials did not comment specifically on the Madame Gu but said in a statement that they took their role “protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously.”', 'A closer examination of Russian assets in the Emirates shows that even before the war in Ukraine, Dubai had become a playground for Russians with links to President Vladimir V. Putin. At least 38 businessmen or officials with ties to the Russian president own homes in Dubai that are collectively valued at more than $314 million, according to the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. Five of those owners are under U.S. sanctions.', 'Since the Russian invasion, Dubai has established itself as a safe haven for Russian yachts and aircraft unable to sail or fly elsewhere. After Russian jets were barred from the European Union in late February, the Emirates became the destination for 14 percent of all private flights leaving Russia, up from 3 percent before the invasion.', '“It’s frustrating when you see huge assets that are sitting out there and it appears that the country is not cooperating,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, referring to the Emirates. “It would be nice if there were more common cause against Putin while he’s busy shelling hospitals and schools.”', 'Mr. Whitehouse is sponsoring legislation that would use proceeds of the sales of seized Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine. Senior officials at the Treasury and State Departments have also complained publicly about the situation.', 'U.S. officials view the presence of superyachts in places like Dubai and Bodrum, Turkey, as a symptom of wider Russian circumvention of sanctions and continued access to financial markets. Yachts have also come to symbolize the decadence of Russia’s oligarchs, especially at a time when Russian soldiers are scrounging for body armor and sleeping bags on the front lines.', 'Built by the Dutch firm Feadship and put into service in 2013, the Madame Gu has a large helicopter pad on its forecastle with a hangar underneath that can double as a squash court when the chopper isn’t on board. The vessel has berthing for 36 crew members, according to one trade magazine.', 'Mr. Skoch, a member of Russia’s Parliament who is linked to assets worth billions of dollars, according to U.S. court filings, has had sanctions imposed on him twice by the United States, first in 2018 and then after Russia’s invasion this year. The Treasury Department has cited his “longstanding ties to Russian organized criminal groups.”', 'Mr. Skoch could not be reached and did not respond to messages left at his office at Parliament.', 'In an interview in October about the government’s broader efforts to go after the assets of oligarchs, Andrew Adams, a federal prosecutor leading the Department of Justice’s KleptoCapture task force, declined to discuss the Madame Gu. But the United States, he said, is warning companies they must not do business with individuals and assets under sanctions. The government, he said, will pursue oligarch-owned assets whose sale could be used to aid Ukraine.', '“Where we know there is an asset that can potentially provide significant remuneration for Ukraine, that obviously is an attractive case to pursue,” he said.', 'U.S. officials are likely to use the case they made for impounding a $90 million Airbus business jet linked to Mr. Skoch in August as a blueprint for seizing the Madame Gu, said people familiar with the plan.', 'That means investigators will aim to show that the owner of the vessel, or the companies that have been providing services to it, have intersected with the U.S. financial system.', '“If there are U.S. dollars or a U.S. nexus associated with supporting this vessel, massive enforcement actions could take place,” said Adam M. Smith, a former official overseeing sanctions at the Treasury Department. Companies that provide support to entities under sanctions could potentially face their own sanctions, said Mr. Smith, who is now a lawyer at Gibson Dunn in Washington.', 'This year the United States has carried out two high-profile seizures of yachts tied to Russians under sanctions, working with cooperative governments. The $300 million Amadea was taken in Fiji in May and sailed to San Diego under an American flag. In April, the United States worked with Spanish police to seize the $90 million Tango.', 'Diplomatically, the Emirates has been reluctant to take a clear anti-Russian position when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, recently met with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg, and the Emirati foreign minister recently hosted his Russian counterpart. Yet Sheikh Mohammed has also talked with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, more than once and recently gave the country $100 million in humanitarian aid.', 'The United States has publicly expressed dismay over the mixed messages.', 'During a visit to Dubai in June, Wally Adeyemo, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary, warned of the need for vigilance and proactive steps in combating Russian evasion. That same month Barbara Leaf, the State Department’s under secretary for Near East Affairs, said at a congressional hearing that regarding the Emirates, she was “not happy at all with the record at this point” on sanctions enforcement. Mr. Adeyemo reiterated his concerns in a meeting with Emirati officials in October in Washington.', 'A senior State Department official said in a statement to The New York Times that the agency continues “to reinforce the importance of conducting enhanced due diligence to prevent sanctions evasion and investigating allegations of such activity” to the Emirates.', 'The Treasury Department declined to comment on the Madame Gu or the relationship with the Emirates.', 'Last month, the Treasury Department announced it had placed sanctions on an Emirates-based company, Constellation Advisors Ltd., that the American government said was operating on behalf of a nephew of another Russian oligarch, Suleiman Kerimov. Mr. Kerimov, according to American court documents, was the owner of the Amadea superyacht.', 'American officials are also worried the Russian government is using the Emirates to acquire military supplies for its war in Ukraine. On Nov. 15, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Emirates-based transportation firms that had worked with another Iranian firm under sanctions, which in turn had helped transport drones and personnel from Iran to Russia. ', 'Based on a recent visit to Dubai’s Mina Rashid Marina, where the Madame Gu is moored, it is clear that international companies are playing a critical role in its care.', 'The Emirates-based company DP World, through its subsidiary P&O Marinas, oversees the pier where the Madame Gu is moored. Employees from another DP World subsidiary, World Security, staff the small guard box at the entrance. That makes DP World, which is owned by Dubai’s royal family, potentially vulnerable to American sanctions.', 'DP World “fully complies with all applicable local and national laws and intends to continue doing the same regarding the Madame Gu and other vessels utilizing our services,” said Adal Mirza, a spokesman for the company. He added that DP World had not yet heard from the United States or other countries that had placed Mr. Skoch under sanctions, including Britain and the European Union.', 'A generator set that dock workers said in late October was powering the Madame Gu — two container-like structures near its stern — bore the distinctive orange logo of Aggreko, a British company. The generator set was connected to the superyacht by thick cords; one of the containers was emitting grayish exhaust.', 'At the Mina Rashid Marina, soon after Aggreko was contacted by The Times, workers removed the generator. “Having identified that the generator was being used to power a vessel that is allegedly connected to a sanctioned person, we immediately terminated this rental and have since recovered the generator,” the company said in a statement.', 'Mr. Mirza, the DP World spokesman, said the Aggreko generator had been replaced with one from a local supplier.', 'P&O Marinas arranged for the diesel generator to provide power for the Madame Gu because that part of the pier, a holding area, has no shore-supplied electric power, said a port official in Dubai, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the press.', '“At the end of the day, if the U.A.E. hasn’t imposed sanctions, it’s not really their job to enforce other countries’ laws within their borders,” said Nabeel Yousef, a Washington-based partner at the law firm Freshfields, where he runs the sanctions practice. Nevertheless, “companies should not take comfort in the fact that their country has not imposed sanctions,” he added, “because even the smallest connection to the U.S. can lead to U.S. penalties.”', 'There has also been a notable absence onboard the Madame Gu in recent weeks: a flag. Unlike other ships moored nearby, including the Quantum Blue, a superyacht linked to the billionaire Sergei Galitsky, the Madame Gu appears to be stateless, apparently having been deflagged by the Cayman Islands.', 'Cayman Islands officials didn’t respond to an emailed inquiry about the ship’s status.', 'If DP World were to face fallout from U.S. sanctions enforcers, it wouldn’t be the first time the company has been the focus of attention in Washington. In 2006, DP World was seeking to manage some terminal operations at six American ports but dropped out of the deal after a bipartisan uproar in Congress.']"

The French president warned in a speech at the French embassy on Wednesday evening and during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the laws could hamper relations between the U.S. and Europe and freeze multinational investment on both continents.', '“The choices made, whose objectives I share, in particular the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, are choices that will fragment the West, because they create such differences between the United States and Europe,” Mr. Macron said at the embassy event.', 'By the time of their joint news conference on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Biden appeared ready to appease Mr. Macron.', '“We’re going to continue to create manufacturing jobs, but not at the expense of Europe,” Mr. Biden said, adding that he was going to address “glitches” in the Inflation Reduction Act.', 'Yet it is unclear how the president might satisfy Mr. Macron’s concerns. Any changes to the law, which passed with only Democratic support, would likely require an act of Congress. Such action could soon be hard to come by: Republicans will take control of the House next year, and key Democrats in the Senate have shown little willingness to water down measures they cemented into law in hopes of bolstering American manufacturing competitiveness.', 'Still, Mr. Macron appeared pleased with the assurances Mr. Biden gave him in the course of a morning meeting at the White House, which included a protracted discussion of Mr. Biden’s economic plans. “We agreed to re-synchronize our approaches, our agendas, in order to invest in critical emerging industries,” Mr. Macron said at the news conference.', 'Mr. Biden’s plans to boost American manufacturing are part of his administration’s efforts to position the United States as a leader in reducing the fossil fuel emissions driving climate change and to become less reliant on foreign nations for critical materials like semiconductors.', 'But the Biden plan has fueled anger across Europe at a critical moment, as the United States tries to keep its Western allies aligned against Russia’s war in Ukraine. Crucial allies in that effort are increasingly accusing the United States of undercutting them at the expense of domestic priorities.', 'Those frustrations have clouded what had been a trans-Atlantic effort to starve President Vladimir V. Putin of oil revenues needed to fuel his war in Ukraine. A looming European ban on Russian oil prompted the Biden administration to push for a workaround that would allow critical supplies of it to continue flowing in order to prevent a spike in global oil prices. European officials reluctantly agreed earlier this year to embrace a U.S. plan that would impose a cap on how much Russia could earn for each barrel it sells.', 'Determining that price has divided the European Union, leaving the issue in limbo just days before the embargo is set to take effect. ', 'Allies’ frustration with the United States has been building since this summer, when Mr. Biden signed two bills aimed at giving a leg up to American industry. The Inflation Reduction Act, a sprawling climate and energy law, offers incentives to support America’s electric vehicle industry and the CHIPS Act contains $52 billion in subsidies and tax credits for any global chip manufacturer that chooses to set up new operations or expand existing ones in the United States. In particular, European officials view the Inflation Reduction Act as putting their domestic companies at a disadvantage.', 'Addressing those concerns and understanding the intent of the law is important “so that we keep very strong ties between France, Europe and the United States,” Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, told Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen ahead of last month’s Group of 20 leaders meeting in Bali.', 'Much of the Europeans’ concern centers on preferential subsidies for electric vehicles that are assembled in North America and use batteries manufactured on the continent. The law also provides tax credits for cars using battery materials that are sourced domestically, or from countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement.', 'European officials have been pressing the United States to make some kind of change to the law to ensure that European manufacturers can share in the same benefits the United States has awarded to Canada and Mexico. ', 'Mr. Biden suggested on Thursday that one provision of the law, which applies to countries with which America has a free-trade agreement, like Canada and Mexico, was actually meant to include “allies” — including those without such a trade deal, like France or the European Union.', '“There’s a lot we can work out,” the president said.', 'Some key lawmakers have expressed reluctance to make any changes. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who leads the Senate Finance Committee, said that Congress had passed the law to stimulate the U.S. auto industry, create American jobs and tackle climate change at the same time.', '“I have no intention of reopening it,” he said. “Congress values America’s partnership with the E.U., but that cannot mean undermining one of the signature elements of our landmark bill.”', 'The debate over electric vehicle subsidies will be one of the most divisive issues on the agenda as the American and European governments hold their latest set of economic meetings in a forum called the Trade and Technology Council, beginning Dec. 5 in Washington.', 'The United States and the European Union set up a task force in October to discuss their split over the electric vehicle provision. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Macron said Thursday they had assigned aides to work closely on that joint effort.', 'European business executives say they would have preferred if those conversations had been held before the law was passed.', 'Markus J. Beyrer, the director general of BusinessEurope, a group representing companies in 35 European countries, said Europeans were disappointed with the policy, “which is discriminating against European production in a very important field without this having been talked about” in the Trade and Technology Council.', '“We have a joint responsibility to find a solution to not allow this issue to poison the relationship,” he said.', 'Biden administration officials have defended the law and encouraged European leaders to join the United States in passing more measures to boost their advanced manufacturing production, as part of a concerted fight against China.', 'U.S. officials “think there is space here for Europe and others, frankly, to take similar steps,” a senior administration official told reporters this week in a background briefing previewing Mr. Macron’s visit. The task force, the official said, allowed for conversations with Europe “to make sure that their approach and our approach ends up complementing one another, being harmonized with one another.”', '“It is reasonably friendly,” Ms. Yellen said of the legislation during The New York Times’s DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “We’re highly dependent on China for most of the minerals that go into making batteries, and the objective of the Inflation Reduction Act is to have more adequate supply chains among our friends, our trading partners.”', 'John Podesta, a senior White House adviser on clean energy innovation and implementation, said this week that the United States was confident that the Inflation Reduction Act did not violate any World Trade Organization rules.', '“We intend upon implementing these provisions and look forward to dialogue,” Mr. Podesta added. “But we think that not only will these be drivers in the U.S. economy, but ultimately these are going to have tremendous benefits across the globe as we drive down the price of clean energy and clean energy technology.”', 'In its discussions with the Europeans, the Biden administration has focused on the other benefits of the new climate legislation for global businesses, and on emphasizing the need for cooperation to combat climate change, people familiar with the discussions said.', 'Privately, American officials and business leaders have also pointed to recent situations in which the Europeans took protectionist trade stances that rankled other governments — such as the E.U.’s carbon border adjustment mechanism and a proposed digital tax.', '“It’s rich that President Macron is criticizing the United States for not coordinating with Europe while Brussels has steadfastly refused to discuss a lengthy list of regulations that threaten to discriminate against American companies,” said Jake Colvin, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents major multinational businesses.', 'The split over the automotive industry comes as the United States is also seeking Europe’s help on limiting the kinds of advanced technology that China can access globally, especially the machinery for producing advanced semiconductors that is marketed globally by Dutch firm ASML.', 'Senior U.S. officials have flown to Europe in recent weeks to press E.U. officials and corporate leaders to join the United States in tightly restricting exports of semiconductor technology to China, arguing that China’s access to such technology poses a national security threat.', 'At her meeting with Mr. Le Maire at the Group of 20 summit in Bali last month, Ms. Yellen noted that America’s relationship with France is critical at such a pivotal time for the global economy. She said that she was open to hearing the concerns that Europeans have about the Inflation Reduction Act and trying to address them, if possible, within the limits of the law that Congress passed.', '“France is America’s oldest friend and ally, and we’re looking forward to continuing to build on our very strong relationship,” Ms. Yellen said.']"

Let us have faith that this will end in the next few months.”', 'After Musk tweeted his peace proposals last month, including one that called for Crimea to be formally part of Russia, Ukrainian officials reacted with anger.

With temperatures in the city often below freezing, extended power outages are also potentially deadly, threatening health care services, raising the risk of people suffering hypothermia and leading to a rise in accidents.', 'Even as crews work around the clock to repair damage from the latest barrage — one last week that temporarily knocked every nuclear power plant in the country offline — the Ukrainian authorities issued urgent warnings that another wave of missiles could be on its way.', '“You go to bed knowing today was bad and tomorrow could be worse,” Vlad Medyk, a 25-year-old musician, said on Monday.', 'He has moved his bed away from the windows in case a Russian missile explodes nearby and he tries to make sure his phone is fully charged before he falls asleep so he can hear an air raid alarm.

Now, with millions of Ukrainians facing the prospect of a winter without heat, discussion is focusing as much on transformers, circuit breakers and surge arresters as on tanks, artillery and air-defense systems.', 'On Tuesday, American officials pledged to give Ukraine $53 million to repair the electrical grid, and sought to rally other allies to make similar offers.', 'The aid commitment came as diplomats from more than 30 nations gathered in Bucharest, Romania, where the NATO secretary-general made clear that the alliance might one day expand to include Ukraine — a stance opposed by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.', '“NATO’s door is open,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO.', 'But for the present, he said, the war has to be the focus.', '“NATO will continue to stand for Ukraine as long as it takes,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “We will not back down.”', 'Western officials say the Ukrainian reconstruction campaign needs to be considered a second front in the war.

Blinken at a meeting of Group of 7 nations and a few other partner countries, on the sidelines of a two-day conclave of NATO foreign ministers.', 'In Ukraine, as the temperatures drop, millions have been living without power and water.', 'Russia’s military has sent wave after wave of missiles and drones to hit the country’s transmission grid, including high-voltage transformer stations, which are more vulnerable than power plants. One senior American official estimated that 25 to 30 percent of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged, though Ukrainian officials have put the figure much higher in recent days.', 'In April, not long after Russian troops swept into Ukraine, American officials marshaled dozens of allies to furnish Ukraine with long-term military aid, and organized the countries into the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.', 'Now U.S. officials want to do much the same on the infrastructure front.', 'The Americans are organizing a working group to help Ukraine repair energy equipment and to better defend its power plants and grid from attack.

Unfortunately, this is the reality that we have to prepare for.”', 'American and European officials say Moscow is trying to break the morale of Ukrainians by depriving them of basic utilities over the winter.

But Ukraine has been tearing through stockpiles, setting off a scramble to supply the country with what it needs while also replenishing NATO members’ own arsenals. Many Western-made howitzers are breaking because of heavy use by Ukrainian troops.', 'Officials also discussed how to better protect the NATO member nations that are closest to Ukraine, including Poland and Romania, from any potential spillover from the conflict. The topic took on a renewed sense of urgency this month when a missile that NATO leaders said appeared to have been fired by Ukraine’s air defense systems killed two civilians in southeastern Poland.', 'It was at a NATO summit also in Bucharest, in 2008, that President George W. Bush forced through a controversial promise that Ukraine and Georgia would join the alliance some day, though when was not clear. Germany and France objected, arguing that the promise was an unnecessary provocation to Russia.', 'Four months later, Mr. Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Georgia, and some analysts have argued that Mr. Putin has been trying ever since to make sure that NATO’s vows to expand to former Soviet states prove hollow.', 'On Tuesday, recalling the 2008 summit meeting, Mr. Stoltenberg said: “We stand by those decisions. NATO’s door is open.”', 'Ukraine, however, will almost certainly not be joining the alliance anytime soon, notwithstanding its longtime ambition to to do so. Admitting a country requires unanimous consent from all NATO members, and the alliance — predicated on the doctrine of mutual defense — is highly unlikely to admit a country already at war.', 'The gathering Tuesday was also attended by the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland, which both applied for NATO membership after Mr. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February.', 'In London on Tuesday, in a speech to British lawmakers, Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, called on the world to hold Russia accountable for atrocities in Ukraine. She said Ukrainians had documented thousands of war crimes committed by Russia, and called for the institution of an international tribunal to prosecute them.', 'Repeatedly citing World War II, Ms. Zelenska recalled that 80 years ago in London, the Allies signed the declaration that became the basis for the Nuremberg trials, which brought many perpetrators of Nazi war crimes to justice.', '“Victory is not the only thing we need,” she said. “We need justice.”']"

As the country, like much of Europe, copes with inflation and high gas prices, there are signs that fatigue may be setting in with some slice of the Polish electorate.', 'In June, the government announced significant cuts in support for Ukrainians, saying that it would withdraw daily allowances to refugees and cancel payments to Polish families hosting them. But most of those cuts, which were supposed to start months ago, have not taken effect because of opposition from municipal governments.', 'The new measures announced by the central government, which are expected to come into effect on March 1, will apply to Ukrainian refugees who have stayed in the country for more than four months.', 'The resolution proposes that Ukrainian citizens staying in “collective accommodation centers,” which are government-funded lodgings, be charged for 50 percent of their housing costs, up to $8.83 each day per person, if they stay in Poland for more than 120 days. Refugees who stay over 180 days will be charged for 75 percent of their housing costs, up to $13.25 each day per person.', 'These rules will not affect many people, because few Ukrainians are staying in these centers anymore, with most having moved into private rental apartments or other private housing.', 'Poland took steps this year to make it easier for thousands of Ukrainian refugees to enter the labor market.

He died suddenly over the weekend, Belarusian state media said on Saturday without offering explanation.', 'Mr. Makei helped his country’s veteran dictator, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, in a series of abortive efforts to balance Moscow’s increasingly dominant influence with outreach to the United States and the European Union. His efforts came even as the country became a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine last February.', 'Shortly after Mr. Makei’s death was reported, the exiled colleagues of a jailed opposition leader, Maria Kolesnikova, said she had been rushed to the intensive care ward of a hospital in western Belarus on Monday, also for unknown reasons.', '“We don’t know what happened, we hope there will be more information soon,” Ms. Kolesnikova’s sister, Tatiana Khomich, said in response to a request for comment.

The family has not been allowed to contact her since the move.', 'Mr. Makei’s sudden death and Ms. Kolesnikova’s unexplained illness put a spotlight on Belarus’s highly unpredictable and enigmatic internal dynamics at a time of heightened political tension in the country created by the war in Ukraine.', 'Ms. Kolsenikova has a reputation as one of Mr. Lukashenko’s most resolute and effective opponents. She is widely admired for having resisted attempts to forcibly deport her from Belarus to Ukraine in 2020 and for vowing to continue her struggle from inside the country instead of taking refuge abroad like many others.', 'This led to her conviction last year on charges of conspiring to seize power illegally. A Belarusian court jailed her for 11 years.', 'Mr. Makei, by contrast, was never a dissident but was a close ally of Mr. Lukashenko.

Lavrov, this week and also travel to Poland for an annual gathering of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.', 'Mr. Lukashenko, in power since 1994 but increasingly beholden to the Kremlin to maintain his position as Europe’s longest-serving leader, has not spoken about Mr. Makei’s death or paid tribute to his long service. The state news agency, Belta, on Saturday published a one-line article saying that the president had offered condolences to Mr. Makei’s family.', 'The foreign minister’s last known official meeting was on Friday with the Apostolic Nuncio in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. A person close to the Vatican diplomatic service said the Nuncio, the Vatican’s equivalent of an ambassador, did not notice anything unusual about Mr. Makei’s physical condition. The foreign minister told the Nuncio he was tired but attributed this to a hectic travel schedule.', ' ', 'Foreign diplomats who had worked with Mr. Makei over the years remembered him as one of the few senior Belarusian officials who could engage in civil conversations with Western leaders while remaining a trusted member of Mr. Lukashenko’s inner circle.', '“Makei was a member of an inner circle of Lukashenko from the very beginning, first as chief of staff and later as the foreign minister,” said Vygaudas Usackas, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, Belarus’s neighbor to the west. “But he was also trying to walk a fine line in terms of keeping options and doors open to talk to the European Union and the West in general until the very last moment.”', '“While understanding the dependence of the regime on Moscow, he was seeking the options of keeping the openings with the West,” Mr. Usackas added.', 'That effort often infuriated Russia, whose president, Vladimir. V. Putin, has made the submission of Belarus to Moscow’s will a central part of a long and, in the case of Ukraine, violent campaign to bring the Slavic lands of the former Soviet Union to heel.', 'Moscow was particularly displeased with a high-level American visit to Minsk in February 2020 by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. During Mr. Pompeo’s visit, in which Mr. Makei figured prominently, the two countries agreed to exchange ambassadors and also discussed the export of oil to Belarus from the United States and its allies, a move that threatened to break Russia’s energy stranglehold on the East European nation.', 'The thaw in relations with Washington ended abruptly six months later when Mr. Lukashenko, backed by Moscow, used brutal force to end protests by hundreds of thousands of people in Minsk and other Belarusian cities after a rigged presidential election that returned him to office for a sixth term.', 'Just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, thrusting toward Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, from Belarusian territory, Mr. Makei insisted at a meeting with foreign journalists in Minsk that Russia would not invade and that its troops, ostensibly gathered in Belarus for training exercises, would soon all return home.', 'Valery Kaveleuski, a former Belarusian diplomat who now lives in exile and supports the opposition, said Mr. Makei’s obedience to Mr. Lukashenko meant that he had “completely lost his appeal to the West as well as his ability to influence government policy.” He predicted that his replacement “will hold a similar approach that is submissive to Russia with extremely limited space for maneuver vis-à-vis the West.”', 'As foreign minister, Mr. Makei led his country’s outreach to the West, which Mr. Lukashenko had tried playing off against Russia in a bid to maintain political power at home.', 'A reserve colonel in the army who was fluent in English and German, Mr. Makei was a rare senior Belarusian officials who could move between hard-liners in the Belarusian security services and European diplomatic circles, making him a valuable member of Mr. Lukashenko’s team, said Pavel Slunkin, a Belarusian political analyst who had worked under Mr. Makei in the foreign ministry.', '“Through him, Lukashenko had found a path to the West,” said Mr. Slunkin, referring to Mr. Makei.', 'Mr. Makei’s diplomatic efforts fell apart after Mr. Lukashenko’s violent crackdown on street protests in 2020. This failed effort rendered the foreign minister, in the eyes of many Belarusians, a symbol of gradual political change that never came, said Mr. Slunkin.', 'Western sanctions in response to Mr. Lukashenko’s crackdown made Belarus increasingly reliant on Russia and its president, Mr. Putin.', 'Valery Sakhashchyk, a former Belarusian military officer now serving as an adviser on defense to the exiled opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, told Ukrainian radio on Monday that Mr. Makei’s death had removed an official who, though “deformed by years of service to Lukashenko,” was “undoubtedly some kind of bridge with the West.”', '“Today, I am afraid that there is no one to fully replace Makei and this may be a problem,” he said. “This may cause such consequences that Russia will take Lukashenka on a very short leash and may turn out badly.”']"

They cut trenches along the irrigation canals. They made foxholes along the road. They built concrete-reinforced bunkers that turned this little farm town into a fortress.', 'Ukrainian commanders have said that they lost hundreds of men in waves of assaults trying to take Pravdyne. It stands at a lonely position about halfway between Kherson, one of the biggest cities the Russians seized, and Mykolaiv, about 30 miles to the northwest, which they were unable to capture.', 'In early November, the Russians began to move out. Ukrainian forces flooded in a few days later. War crimes investigators, aid workers and others soon followed. A tip from a journalist who had spoken with villagers led investigators to the common grave on Monday. Investigators are removing the bodies to analyze the cause of death and to seek to use the evidence for war-crimes prosecutions of Russian forces.', '“I knew it would be hard but I wasn’t prepared for this,” said Serhiy Rebizhenko, a handyman who had been drafted by village elders to dig out the common grave. “I knew these people. I had just joked with them. And now look at them.”', 'Even veteran police officers seemed shaken. They catalogued the body parts, barely saying a word.

But Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s Donbas region, has become a destructive vortex for both countries’ militaries. For months, they have thrown masses of troops and matériel into battle here as the Russians mount desperate attempts to capture the city and the Ukrainians to hold it.', 'The results have been near catastrophic. The city, once with a population of around 70,000, has slowly been chewed apart. And now, according to residents and Ukrainian soldiers, the bombardment in and around Bakhmut is at an intensity never before seen. Buildings that had been shelled before have been shelled again. The front line, on the city’s outskirts, looks like a muddy moonscape, or a scene from World War I. At night, residents can hear the grumble of Russian jets prowling the skies.

Elsewhere along their 600-mile front line, the Russians are mostly digging in for winter to entrench and conserve resources.', 'In summer, after Russian forces captured the neighboring province of Luhansk, seizing Bakhmut might have looked like a natural progression in Russia’s campaign to conquer the east — a step toward two more important cities, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. But now, analysts said, given the degradation of Russian forces and their ammunition shortages after a series of setbacks, that goal seems improbable, especially after the loss of their foothold in the northeast.', '“The Russian military is still dealing with unrealistic political demands to show progress,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va. “But given poor quality of available forces and decreasing stocks of artillery ammunition, they are unlikely to be successful, because once again the Russian military appears to be feeding units piecemeal without adequate support.”', 'In recent weeks, Moscow’s need for any type of military victory has made itself felt in pockets elsewhere along the front line. Small villages near the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk have turned into flash points. But as the temperature plummets, Bakhmut has quickly evolved into Moscow’s main effort, where masses of their forces — including recently mobilized troops, according to Ukrainian soldiers — are trying to strangle the city from the east and south.', 'Russia’s strategy in Bakhmut is reminiscent of its seizure of the eastern cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in June. There, Russian troops relied on superior artillery fire to overpower Ukrainian forces and gain ground. But the Ukrainian forces they faced then were short of both shells and Western-supplied artillery — something that is no longer as pressing, especially in Bakhmut.', '“In the six months that I’ve been in Bakhmut, I have never seen our artillery working like this,” said a Ukrainian soldier in the city, referring to the volume of Ukrainian shells fired. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.', 'But at this point in the war both armies may find the pace of bombardment hard to sustain. The Russians are reportedly trying to buy munitions from North Korea and Iran. And Ukraine continues to ask for more artillery shells from NATO and other donor countries, even though those nations’ stockpiles are dwindling.', 'One of the Pentagon’s frequent concerns is that the Ukrainians are firing ammunition at an unsustainable rate — especially in places like Bakhmut — under the false assumption that the West’s supply of ordnance is unlimited, said the U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.', 'As Bakhmut — shelled continually by the Russians since July — devolves into a battle of attrition, its strategic significance has changed, too. Even if Russia’s hopes of expanding its territory here have dwindled, it can still make the city a resource-intensive black hole for Kyiv, taking troops from other Ukrainian priorities, potentially including future offensives.', '“Battles like Bakhmut consume forces that could be used elsewhere,” Mr. Kofman said, adding that Russian forces are using people they deem “expendable,” but even so, they cannot afford to waste that much artillery.', 'The Ukrainian forces holding Bakhmut are from a hodgepodge of units, including the 93rd Mechanized Brigade and the 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade, crack units that have been worn down by nonstop Russian assaults.', 'Troops from other brigades have arrived in recent weeks to plug holes in the lines and shore up formations floundering after heavy casualties. But even though the numbers of Ukrainian wounded and dead are steep, the attacking Russians are suffering far worse, Ukrainian soldiers say, as their exposed assaults are cut down by artillery and machine-gun fire.', 'U.S. defense officials estimate that Russia and Ukraine have each suffered around 100,000 wounded and dead over the course of the war, though those numbers are impossible to verify, the casualty numbers in Bakhmut even more so.', 'Colder temperatures and muddy trenches are also causing injuries on both sides. Pro-Russian military bloggers have complained about a lack of cold-weather clothing, especially among recently mobilized forces. And doctors at the Bakhmut hospital said hypothermia and trench foot, a painful skin condition caused by prolonged immersion in cold water, were common among Ukrainian forces, though treated quickly and often at the front line.', '“The soldiers are getting everything they need — thermal underwear, winter coats, everything. But it does not fix everything,” said Ihor, a doctor at the hospital, who like others gave only his first name for security reasons. “Under the rain for two, three days, in the trenches — you understand.”', 'On Friday, Ukrainian soldiers who had recently come off the line huddled in front of the hospital, their faces, uniforms and weapons covered in splotchy mud, their trousers soaked from the recent rain. Medics from the 58th Brigade flinched as an incoming artillery round struck nearby but barely reacted as a second shell came so close that it cracked and shattered nearby windows: They were intent on moving their patient.', 'Much of the city’s eastern reaches — around a once acclaimed winery — is a gray zone between Russian and Ukrainian positions. To its south, the village of Optyne is heavily contested.', 'The mobilized Russian troops “are just taking a rifle and walking right down like in Soviet times,” said another Ukrainian medic going by the call sign Smile. “He gets killed and the next one comes up the same way.”', 'Recent battlefield advances around Bakhmut have been measured in yards, not miles. Every day is a kaleidoscope of Russian and Ukrainian forces either pushing forward or retreating, often resulting in minimal gains at a bloody cost.', 'On Friday, one Ukrainian soldier said, his unit was retreating when he was blown off his feet by a mortar, while another unit elsewhere in Bakhmut was assaulting a Russian position.', 'Ayrat, a soldier from the 71st Brigade, was pushing toward a Russian trench when he was wounded in both legs by a grenade, either dropped by a drone or fired by a Russian grenade launcher.', '“We went for an assault,” he said, speaking hoarsely in a dimly lit hospital hall and wrapped in a foil survival blanket. His unit had approached where Russians “were entrenched.”', '“My comrades are alive,” he said, wincing through the pain. “Do you have a cigarette?”']"

It was wrong.,"['BRUSSELS — When the Soviet Union collapsed, European nations grabbed the “peace dividend,” drastically shrinking their defense budgets, their armies and their arsenals.', 'With the rise of Al Qaeda nearly a decade later, terrorism became the target, requiring different military investments and lighter, more expeditionary forces. Even NATO’s long engagement in Afghanistan bore little resemblance to a land war in Europe, heavy on artillery and tanks, that nearly all defense ministries thought would never recur.', 'But it has.', 'In Ukraine, the kind of European war thought inconceivable is chewing up the modest stockpiles of artillery, ammunition and air defenses of what some in NATO call Europe’s “bonsai armies,” after the tiny Japanese trees. Even the mighty United States has only limited stocks of the weapons the Ukrainians want and need, and Washington is unwilling to divert key weapons from delicate regions like Taiwan and Korea, where China and North Korea are constantly testing the limits.', 'Now, nine months into the war, the West’s fundamental unpreparedness has set off a mad scramble to supply Ukraine with what it needs while also replenishing NATO stockpiles. As both sides burn through weaponry and ammunition at a pace not seen since World War II, the competition to keep arsenals flush has become a critical front that could prove decisive to Ukraine’s effort.', 'The amount of artillery being used is staggering, NATO officials say. In Afghanistan, NATO forces might have fired even 300 artillery rounds a day and had no real worries about air defense. But Ukraine can fire thousands of rounds daily and remains desperate for air defense against Russian missiles and Iranian-made drones.', '“A day in Ukraine is a month or more in Afghanistan,” said Camille Grand, a defense expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who until recently was NATO’s assistant secretary general for defense investment.', 'Last summer in the Donbas region, the Ukrainians were firing 6,000 to 7,000 artillery rounds each day, a senior NATO official said. The Russians were firing 40,000 to 50,000 rounds per day.', 'By comparison, the United States produces only 15,000 rounds each month.', 'So the West is scrambling to find increasingly scarce Soviet-era equipment and ammunition that Ukraine can use now, including S-300 air defense missiles, T-72 tanks and especially Soviet-caliber artillery shells.', 'The West is also trying to come up with alternative systems, even if they are older, to substitute for shrinking stocks of expensive air-defense missiles and anti-tank Javelins. It is sending strong signals to Western defense industries that longer-term contracts are in the offing — and that more shifts of workers should be employed and older factory lines should be refurbished. It is trying to purchase ammunition from countries like South Korea to “backfill” stocks being sent to Ukraine.', 'There are even discussions about NATO investing in old factories in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria to restart the manufacturing of Soviet-caliber 152-mm and 122-mm shells for Ukraine’s still largely Soviet-era artillery armory.', 'But the obstacles are as myriad as the solutions being pursued.', 'NATO countries — often with great fanfare — have provided Ukraine some advanced Western artillery, which uses NATO-standard 155-mm shells. But NATO systems are rarely certified to use rounds produced by other NATO countries, which often make the shells differently. (That is a way for arms manufacturers to ensure that they can sell ammunition for their guns, the way printer manufacturers make their money on ink cartridges.)', 'And then there is the problem of legal export controls, which govern whether guns and ammunition sold to one country can be sent to another one at war. This is the reason the Swiss, claiming neutrality, refused Germany permission to export to Ukraine needed antiaircraft ammunition made by Switzerland and sold to Germany. Italy has a similar restriction on arms exports.', 'One NATO official described the mixed bag of systems that Ukraine must now cope with as “NATO’s petting zoo,” given the prevalence of animal names for weapons like the Gepard (German for cheetah) and the surface-to-air missile system called the Crotale (French for rattlesnake). So resupply is difficult, as is maintenance.', 'The Russians, too, are having resupply problems of their own. They are now using fewer artillery rounds, but they have a lot of them, even if some are old and less reliable. Facing a similar scramble, Moscow is also trying to ramp up military production and is reportedly seeking to buy missiles from North Korea and more cheap drones from Iran.', 'Given the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in the Donbas region, NATO’s new military spending goals — 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024, with 20 percent of that on equipment instead of salaries and pensions — seem modest. But even those were largely ignored by key member countries.', 'In February, when the war in Ukraine began, stockpiles for many nations were only about half of what they were supposed to be, the NATO official said, and there had been little progress in creating weapons that could be used interchangeably by NATO countries.', 'Even within the European Union, only 18 percent of defense expenditures by nations are cooperative.', 'For NATO countries that have given large amounts of weapons to Ukraine, especially frontline states like Poland and the Baltics, the burden of replacing them has proved heavy.', 'The French, for instance, have provided some advanced weapons and created a 200-million-euro fund (about $208 million) for Ukraine to buy arms made in France. But France has already given at least 18 modern Caesar howitzers to Ukraine — about 20 percent of all of its existing artillery — and is reluctant to provide more.', 'The European Union has approved €3.1 billion ($3.2 billion) to repay member states for what they provide to Ukraine, but that fund, the European Peace Facility, is nearly 90 percent depleted.', 'In total, NATO countries have so far provided some $40 billion in weaponry to Ukraine, roughly the size of France’s annual defense budget.', 'Smaller countries have exhausted their potential, another NATO official said, with 20 of its 30 members “pretty tapped out.” But the remaining 10 can still provide more, he suggested, especially larger allies. That would include France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.', 'NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has advised the alliance — including, pointedly, Germany — that NATO guidelines requiring members to keep stockpiles should not be a pretext to limit arms exports to Ukraine. But it is also true that Germany and France, like the United States, want to calibrate the weapons Ukraine gets, to prevent escalation and direct attacks on Russia.', 'The Ukrainians want at least four systems that the West has not provided and is unlikely to: long-range surface-to-surface missiles known as ATACMS that could hit Russia and Crimea; Western fighter jets; Western tanks; and a lot more advanced air defense, said Mark F. Cancian, a former White House weapons strategist who is now a senior adviser at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies.', 'The ATACMS, with a range of some 190 miles, will not be given for fear they could hit Russia; the tanks and fighter jets are just too complicated, requiring a year or more to train in how to use and maintain. As for air defense, Mr. Cancian said, NATO and the United States deactivated most of their short-range air defense after the Cold War, and there is little to go around. Producing more can take up to two years.', 'Maintenance is key, but there are clever answers for relatively simpler equipment, like the M-777 howitzer given to Ukraine. With the right parts, a Ukrainian engineer can link up to an American artillery officer in Fort Sill, Okla., and get talked through maintenance over Zoom.', 'Ukraine has also proved adaptable. Its forces are known inside NATO as “the MacGyver Army,” a reference to an old television series in which the hero is inventive and improvisational with whatever comes to hand.', 'To shell Russian positions at Snake Island, for instance, the Ukrainians put Caesars, with a 40-kilometer range, on barges and towed them out 10 kilometers to hit the island, which was 50 kilometers away, astonishing the French. Ukraine also sank the Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with its own adapted missiles, and has built drones that can attack ships at sea.', 'American officials insist that the U.S. military still has enough matériel to continue supplying Ukraine and defend U.S. interests elsewhere.', '“We are committed to providing Ukraine with what it needs on the battlefield,” Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, said this month after announcing more Stinger missiles for Ukraine.', 'Washington is also looking at older, cheaper alternatives like giving Ukraine anti-tank TOW missiles, which are in plentiful supply, instead of Javelins, and Hawk surface-to-air missiles instead of newer versions. But officials are increasingly pushing Ukraine to be more efficient and not, for example, fire a missile that costs $150,000 at a drone that costs $20,000.', 'Already, some weapons are running low.', 'As of September, the U.S. military had a limited number of 155-mm artillery rounds in its stockpiles, and limited numbers of guided rockets, rocket launchers, howitzers, Javelins and Stingers, according to an analysis by Mr. Cancian. ', 'The shortage in 155-mm artillery shells “is probably the big one that has the planners most concerned,” Mr. Cancian said.', '“If you want to increase production capability of 155 shells,” he said, “it’s going to be probably four to five years before you start seeing them come out the other end.”']"
