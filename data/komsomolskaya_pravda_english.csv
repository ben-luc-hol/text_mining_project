The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on November 27, 2022. The LPR reported that the brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Svatovo and Kremennaya consist almost entirely of mercenaries. It is noted that the reason for such personnel decisions were large losses in the ranks of the Ukrainian army. The mayor of Horlivka, Prikhodko, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled the Church of St. Andrew the First-Called. Two direct hits to the temple are reported. The Russian military repelled the attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donetsk direction in the area of three settlements. The Russian military destroyed the HIMARS MLRS ammunition depot. This was reported in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. An air alert was announced in several regions of Ukraine on November 26, 2022. This is evidenced by the data of the online map of the Ministry of Digitalization of the country. In the LPR, the tankers survived in a knocked-out tank and continued to serve during a special operation."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4683500/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-11-26,Ukraine switched to generators and firewood,"The energy system of Independence, if it is completely restored, still breathes on the incense in anticipation of the next missile strikes.","Of all the arts, as Comrade Lenin said, the most important is cinema, and of all the fuels and energy resources, such are firewood. As you understand, I am not talking about ""backward Russia"", but about the advanced and civilized countries of Europe and disguised as the same Ukraine. While the European Commission is trying to first set a ""price ceiling"" for Russian energy resources, after which the question will inevitably arise where to take these resources when Russia refuses to supply them, Ukraine approached the issue decisively and radically. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal announced that Kiev banned the export of firewood. According to Shmygal, firewood is the main type of fuel in the frontline regions. But here, of course, he embellished reality. As for the frontline, because the regions of Western Ukraine are still far from the frontline status, and the firewood there flies to the stoves and boilers - only on the way. Yes, in general, now and everywhere, not just there. In many cities of Ukraine, people began to put stoves-bourgeois not only in private houses, but also in their city apartments. As they write in the Ukrainian Telegram channels, ""the local population is cutting down forest belts and plantations in full swing, realizing that they will have to solve the problems with the lack of heat in homes on their own."" But Ukrainians should understand that this is still half the way to become full-fledged Europeans. Real Europeans not only harvest, buy and sell for the purpose of profit this 2 times more expensive primitive fuel, but also steal it. This is already happening all the time in Germany, Poland, Latvia, etc. In Latvia, they went the furthest – local insurance companies have already begun to insure firewood against theft. But, again, the offer is really not for everyone, but only for those diligent owners who guessed not to put wood under a public canopy in logs, but closed them in a room at the entrance to which a lock hangs on the door. The castle can be anything, barn, even great-grandfather of the times of ""Ochakov and the conquest of the Crimea"" or modern modern with a digital set. The main thing is the fact of the presence and performance of the main function. The next step in protecting firewood from criminal attacks by suspicious elements should be to install an alarm system and an ""alarm button"" on the woodshed to call the police rapid response team. And it's not a joke at all. Just think, some month ago, the leadership of Ukraine and personally the ""bloody soldier"" promised to help Europe and guaranteed it the supply of electricity to replace Russian carbon resources, and now they are begging for the same Europe, gas, oil products and gasoline and diesel generators for the production of electricity. By the way, most of these generators are not designed for continuous operation for a long time. Their purpose is to insure for the period when electricity is cut off. And it is expensive to produce a kilowatt-hour from gasoline or diesel fuel. But they are now being imported to Ukraine on some cosmic scale. According to the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the head of the Golos faction Yaroslav Zheleznyak, 136 thousand generators worth almost $ 88 million have already been delivered to Nezalezhnaya, and the flow of delivery does not weaken. Generators are needed everywhere. - Cafes, services, offices - all on generators, - said the head of the public organization ""SAVE FOP"" Sergey Dorotic. And for lovers of ""savory cava"" because of this, the prices of their favorite drink have risen. - Surcharge + 7 hryvnia, when the generator works, - read the ads on the sheets in Kiev cafes, and for a small cup of ""Americano"" for 25 hryvnia or a cup of tea for 20 hryvnia this is a very significant rise in price. The owners of cafes and generators extract additional profit, which was not dreamed of by the same Viennese restaurateurs. Ukraine has not been able to restore the normal operation of the energy system until now. But that's not the point. The main thing is that no one will give guarantees from the next missile strikes of the Russian army, which will trample the energy of Ukraine, necessary for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the repair and restoration of military equipment, literally in the autumn-winter mud.

According to the administration of the Skadov district, the work was carried out on behalf of the head of Kabardino-Balkaria Kazbek Kokov. The region provides patronage assistance to this Kherson city. The roofing crew dismantled the old slate (it was in terrible condition) and blocked the roof with an area of more than 900 square meters. meters galvanized profiled steel. All materials for this used good quality, assured the foreman of the roofers Evgeny Gergeman. - Did a great job on the roof of the garden. The old roof was leaky, the slate was battered. We threw new beams, made a new truss system, a new metal profile, made railings and a drainage system,"" Gergeman said. But that's not the whole transformation of The Bell. Chefs from Kabardino-Balkaria promised the kindergarten a new playground. And they will, of course, keep the promise."

The situation on the territory remains difficult, and the military, as well as specialists, helped the population all this time, restored communication and power lines. Humanitarian supplies were brought here every week. Now the participants of the united Russia state commission are monitoring the conditions in the temporary accommodation centers where the evacuated Kherson residents live. Russian volunteers participated in the evacuation of residents from Kherson and part of the left bank of the Kherson region. Not everyone decided to say goodbye to home and go to sanatoriums and boarding houses in the Krasnodar Territory, Voronezh. Some residents remained in their homeland - they live in temporary accommodation centers in safe areas of the region. To help people, the participants of the humanitarian mission personally got acquainted with the living conditions in the Skadovsky district. - First of all, I look at the availability of beds, heat and hot water. There should also be a normal place for cooking. In my opinion, there is still a lot of work to be done here - it is necessary to insulate, to equip the places of reception and cooking with dishes and furniture, - said State Duma deputy, head of the humanitarian mission of the United Russia party Igor Kastyukevich. - At the same time, I see that the administration is working. We will come here again in a few days. We will also come, inspect the PVR and help people. Now residents are in shock. For example, I talked to a woman who came from Vysokopolye in a confused state. Calmed her down a bit. You need to communicate with people. Volunteers helped to evacuate a disabled child from Kherson. 13-year-old Anya has a serious diagnosis - partial brain damage. The girl's mother left her and went to Poland. The girl was taken care of by her grandmother in recent months. Realizing that it was impossible to stay further in the city, the woman asked for help. - We decided to leave Kherson for my sister. In our house now there are continuous problems - there is no light, no water, no gas, it is very cold there. We stayed in it as long as we could, and now we decided to leave. Thanks to the volunteers for promptly taking us and bringing us to a safe place, - said a resident of Kherson Raisa Ivanovna. Volunteers took the family to Armyansk in the Republic of Crimea, where they were met by relatives. The humanitarian mission helped residents to evacuate not only from Kherson, but also from the districts of the region. Basically, volunteers transported people with limited mobility together with their families. - We work every day in the city and the region - both on the right and on the left bank. And if earlier it was rumbling somewhere behind Chernobaevka and everyone is already accustomed to such ""arrivals"" and noise, then in recent days the work of artillery sounds completely different, much louder and closer. I appeal to the parents who stayed with their children in Kherson: the child should not wince from the explosions! If possible, evacuate. It's important! - said Igor Kastyukevich. Recently, they helped to take out a 79-year-old resident of Kherson Ekaterina Marchenko. An elderly woman can hardly move. With a request to help leave the city to the volunteers of the party appealed to her daughter Valentina. - I turned to the volunteer guys. Within half an hour we packed up and drove. We were loaded onto a ship in Kherson, taken to Aleshki, put in a car and taken from there to our destination. I am very grateful and glad. There are simply no words, - shared the evacuated resident of Kherson Valentina Marchenko. Ekaterina and Valentina Marchenko lived all their lives in Kherson. When the opportunity arose, they were among the first to receive Russian passports. - My grandmother was born in 1943, it is already very difficult for her to walk. As we drove her to the car, every step she said, ""I'm sorry, I never thought I'd live to see that."" We also did not think, but today is such a time, - said denis Moiseev, a participant of the humanitarian mission. - We must fight for such people, they must be taken out. The more people we take out of the shelling zone, the better. At the same time, in Kherson, volunteers of the United Russia humanitarian aid center from local residents continue to provide those in need with food and necessary things. Thus, volunteers handed over food packages, baby food and hygiene products to the village of Fedorovka."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4683443/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-11-27,New Russian weapons,"Not only in Kiev, but also in Warsaw, Brussels and Washington are forced to recognize the painful effectiveness of Russian weapons.","We are trying to fight not by numbers, but by skill - we are trying to follow the testament of Generalissimo Suvorov, including in the zone of special operations. Former Deputy Prime Minister and former head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin recently said that in the near future our troops on the fronts of the SVO will begin to receive those best and newest samples produced by our military-industrial complex, which have not yet been used. And which will unpleasantly surprise the enemy. That's a good thing, of course. But it should be noted that by mid-November, our troops had already used a lot of modern weapons systems during the SVO. They not only showed themselves magnificently in a real combat situation, but also allowed us to save a lot of lives of our fighters during attacking and defensive actions, as well as without painful losses for personnel to hit the painful points of the enemy. Only in the first 10 days of November and only in the sky of the Donetsk People's Republic, about 200 Missiles of American Highmars MLRS were destroyed by russian air defense combat crews. The greatest effectiveness in the fight against drones and multiple launch rocket systems of the enemy, according to the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Oleg Salyukov, show the S-300V (B4) air defense system, the Buk-MZ (M2)and Tor-M2 (M2U, M2DT) air defense systems. The fighters, attack aircraft and helicopters remaining with the Ukrainian Air Force also come under crushing fire from both anti-aircraft missile systems and our aviation. ""When it is necessary to deal with suddenly appearing air targets at extremely low altitudes, our fighters turn to the Igla and Verba MANPADS,"" General Salyukov emphasized. - With their help, a significant part of the manned aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was eliminated. The most striking of the latest examples was the work in October of the S-300V4 complex, which destroyed two Ukrainian ""dryers"". The Su-24 and Su-27, which were heading to attack targets in the Belgorod region, were destroyed by this modern and very long-range wax air defense system at a range of more than 210 kilometers. Military experts note that the control system of air defense troops created on the basis of automated weapon control means ""Polyana-D4M1"" and ""Barnaul-T"" from the ESU TK, confirmed its effectiveness and the ability to control the forces and means of air defense in real time. Both new and proven arstystems showed themselves in the SVO zone. For example, the 152-mm howitzers ""Msta-B"" work in detail is known in all sectors of the front. ""Our gun is the most accurate,"" says the gunner sergeant in the southern section. - It's like a sniper rifle for us gunners. When working with it, you need to do everything carefully, set the guidance clearly. And the most important thing is not to make mistakes in calculations. The calculations of the Msta-B, which is capable of aiming at a range of almost 30 kilometers and can fire up to 7 shells per minute, and in November continues to destroy foreign samples of weapons and equipment supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine both in the Zaporozhye direction and in the DPR. ""High-explosive, high-explosive fragmentation, as well as high-precision ammunition are used,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. - This allows you to inflict maximum damage to fortifications, buried concrete fortifications, armored vehicles and enemy manpower at a considerable distance. And on November 11, the strongholds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Ugledar were eliminated by fire from the Msta-S and Acacia self-propelled guns. The maximum damage was inflicted on the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the 108th Brigade of Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to which our gunners worked with aim during the loading of personnel and equipment."

Then the territorial bodies were fully formed, the employees of the units were already patrolling the streets, ensuring road safety, conducting operational search measures and investigative work. But Russia is expanding its borders, so in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, the prosecutor's office of the Russian Federation has been formed. This was stated by the press service of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation. - Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation Igor Krasnov signed orders on the formation of prosecutor's offices of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions in the system of the Prosecutor's Office of Russia in order to organize proper prosecutorial supervision in the educated subjects of the Russian Federation, the report said.

Organizational measures have been taken to fill vacant posts of heads of educated prosecutor's offices. - With the advent of Russia, it has become safe in our cities again. Previously, we were not so sure of the order on our streets, because often there were situations that the police did not care about. Finally, we see a completely different situation. Thanks to Russia, - says a resident of Kherson Nadezhda.

So, the other day the equipment for the employees of the State Traffic Police was delivered by the head of the traffic police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Chechnya Idris Cherkhigov. The guest who arrived at the special operation zone handed over to the head of the State Automobile Inspectorate Roman Emelyanov sets of winter equipment, special signals, cockades, light beams, radios and other equipment.

Kadyrov said. According to him, the elimination of sniper pillboxes, as well as the identification of saboteurs and gunners directly on the front line, allows Russian forces to move forward with minimal losses. ""I remember how the guys from Chechnya came to Volnovakha,"" says local resident Tatyana Belostokova. - They brought food, water.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4683421/,Irina GERTS,2022-11-19,In memory of Kirill Stremousov,He was never afraid to tell the truth.,"What was the deputy head of the administration of the Kherson region, who climbed on the horn for the benefit of local residents. In early November, all Russians were shocked by a terrible event - in a road accident near Genichesk, deputy chairman of the administration of the Kherson region Kirill Stremousov died. The man who was never afraid to tell the truth and made a huge contribution to the freedom and formation of a new region of Russia was only 45 years old. The future fighter for justice in the Kherson region was born in the village of Golmovsky, Donetsk region in 1976. It is noteworthy that after almost three decades, Donbass will be the first to begin the path of confrontation with the Ukrainian regime. The political path of Kirill Stremousov did not begin immediately. After graduating first from the Motor Transport College, and then the West Ukrainian National University, the future deputy head of the administration of the Kherson region chose a career as an entrepreneur - he became the owner of a company for the production of fish feed, and later faced with the corruption of the fish inspectorate, decided to change the situation and got a job in the department. Kirill's honesty and dedication were appreciated - in 2007 he was appointed to a senior position in the Kiev Committee of Fisheries. The new Ukrainian regime has always been Kirill's tycoon, so he could not work for a long time among the officials of the independent politician - in 2009 he left the capital's career and went to Kherson. Moving to Kherson became for Kirill Stremousov a starting point to a new chapter of life. As he later said in an interview, at that time his weight was about 125 kg, and his health was deteriorating sharply. Kirill understood that something needs to change in life. The former entrepreneur completely abandoned alcohol and tried to adhere to a healthy diet. Yoga helped Kirill to put his body in order. In 2011, a man tired of the oppressive Ukrainian regime went on a trip, having received a work visa to the United States. For several years he hitchhiked in the United States, Central and South America, and then wrote a book about his impressions ""Notes of a Motorcyclist"". Love for the Motherland prevailed, and Kirill could not stay abroad for a long time. Returning to Kherson, he clearly understood that if it is not possible to exist in a nationalist political regime, then something needs to change. At first, Kirill Stremousov engaged in public activities - he took the post of chairman in the local branch of the Christian Democratic Union party, headed the public organization ""Anti-Criminal Choice"" and gave lectures to young people. Stremousov also created the Ukrainian Center for Environmental Self-Defense and the Tavria News Agency. In 2014, when his native Donbass had just begun the struggle for independence from Ukraine, Kirill Stremousov organized an anti-Maidan rally in Kherson. The honesty and openness of the man won the trust of local residents, and soon Stremousov became the chairman of the Kherson branch of the Socialist Party of Ukraine. Even then, Kirill realized that the future of the region is only with Russia. In 2021, he became a member of the pro-Russian Derzhava party. With the beginning of the special operation, the politician immediately openly expressed his position. As the head of the Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, would later say at the farewell ceremony with Kirill Stremousov, he was never ""afraid to climb on the horn."" Thanks to his honesty and courage, Kirill won the trust of Kherson residents, so local residents had no doubt that he would become the ""first hand"" of the head of the administration of the new region, Vladimir Saldo - the former mayor of Kherson. Kirill Stremousov did not go through his political and social path alone. Next to him was always his beloved wife Oksana, who supported him in all his endeavors. The couple raised five children - sons Yaroslav, Zlatomir, Lev and daughters Milada and Amelia. Soon Kirill was preparing to become a father for the sixth time - Oksana is pregnant with a daughter. Unfortunately, fate decreed otherwise. The farewell ceremony with the deceased vice-governor of the Kherson region took place in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Simferopol two days after his death - on November 11. Kirill Stremousov was buried in the Crimean capital - the city of Simferopol. Relatives wished to avoid excessive publicity and decided to say goodbye to their loved one in a quiet environment. The grave of the vice-governor of kherson region is strewn with flowers, wreaths and farewell notes from relatives and friends. In honor of Kirill Stremousov, they plan to name one of the streets in Simferopol, and according to Vladimir Saldo, a monument to the fearless politician will certainly appear in the Kherson region. After all, Kirill Stremousov made an undeniable contribution to the Kherson region - he was not afraid to be the first to start the struggle to make the region free."

Russian troops were forced to withdraw from the city in the morning. Ukrainian militants gradually began to enter the region. Their flags, logos and nationalist swastikas began to appear on the buildings. But even now, the enemy understands that Russia will not leave Kherson and the locals without help. The Russian Federation managed to return to the remaining people in the region vital communications that the enemy violated during the terrorist attack that occurred on the Berislav- Kakhovka power line on November 6. Five days before the withdrawal of Russian troops from the city, the emergency services of the Kherson region reported that the actions of the nationalist organization caused a power outage in 10 settlements, including Kherson. For a while, the streets and houses literally went into darkness, the lights went out everywhere. The explosion was so strong that even the generators were turned off. ""We didn't understand what had happened. In the moment, it even became very scary that everything went out and disappeared. But, you know, we are already accustomed to various dirty tricks on the part of Ukraine and the Kiev regime, we lived in such fear for about eight years, so we did not discover anything new for ourselves. Constant terrorist attacks, sabotage and other antics... We are already tired of this, but now we have a huge hope that Russia will save us from a past life and will not abandon us in a difficult situation, because it does not abandon its own, ""says local resident Valeria. Emergency services immediately began to restore the work of vital communications in each microdistrict of the city. RUSSIA IS NOT ABANDONING ITS OWN. To date, the light has returned to the city streets again in almost the entire territory of Kherson. Including on the right bank of the city, not controlled by the Russian Federation. For example, the central area is fully illuminated, the supply of water and heat is ensured, the sewerage system also works stably. - The part of the city that our military guards have long lived with light and water. All communications were returned here in just a couple of days. When the whole city was covered with darkness, even after the explosion, we thought that such damage would be restored for a very long time or not at all, as it was before, under the Kiev regime. But thanks to the Russian emergency services and their instant response, it was possible to restore all the most important things. Our houses were not dark or cold, everything quickly returned to work. We have great confidence in Russia. We believe and hope that soon everything will calm down and we will be able to live our peaceful, bright and joyful life. We are on the right track, I am sure, - says Viktor, a resident of Kherson. According to officials, at the moment there are 18 pumping stations, 10 sewage pumping stations, four hospitals, treatment facilities and one boiler house of the CHP in the region. For the entire time of the special operation, the residents of Kherson had to endure many shocks. But life under the Kiev regime still evokes genuine emotions of fear and horror in them. Locals express the hope that sooner or later the Russian tricolor will rise again over their hometown, as befits a Russian city, and they will live a peaceful and peaceful life under the wing of Russia."

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""See in the company - the family, in the chief - the father, in the comrade - his brother,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And he also repeated: ""Pushing back the enemy is a failure. Cut off, surrounded, scattered – good luck."" RESTORED COMMUNICATION TO THE COMMAND POST. Sergeant Vasily DOROSHENOK. ""During a special military operation, Sergeant Vasily Doroshenko, in conditions of systematic fire from the enemy, provided uninterrupted communication to the command post of the Russian Armed Forces grouping in one of the settlements. Ukrainian nationalists attacked the positions of Russian troops, as a result of which communication equipment was damaged.

Thanks to the brave and confident actions of Sergeant Doroshenko, as well as his professionalism, communication within the command post was restored, which made it possible to quickly manage subordinate forces during the defense and successfully repel the enemy's attack.

The enemy counterattacked, German Burtsev received a serious leg wound from artillery fire, but continued to command the detachment. Seeing that the enemy's battle formations were upset, Burtsev decided to pursue the retreating nationalists. Thanks to the bold and decisive actions of German Burtsev, it was possible to quickly and without losses to oust the enemy from the settlement and take advantageous lines to continue successful offensive actions.

Raznatovsky's detachment continued active offensive operations despite the heavy fire of the enemy, which made it possible to distract the main enemy forces from the place of the breakthrough of the scouts. Thanks to the competent and verified actions of Raznatovsky, the unit that fell into the encirclement broke through, and Raznatovsky's detachment withdrew to the defensive lines without losses among the personnel.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4683387/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-11-26,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on November 26, 2022: Will drug cartels help Kiev and what Zelensky knows about the freedom of Crimea","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on November 26, 2022","Zelensky wants to go to Crimea, but he can't. The sixth president of the independent told the respectable Publication of the Financial Times about his vision of ""peace after the war."" The KVN veteran said that now the world is ""confused about the situation and what will happen to crimea"" (I wonder who told him this about the peninsula?). The leader of the independent state noted that if someone offers Kiev ""a way to de-occupy the Crimea by non-military means,"" then he himself will be ""only for it."" At the same time, Zelensky said that ""it is not worth wasting time"" on discussions if the decision assumes that Crimea remains part of Russia. Of course, it's not worth wasting time – Crimea remains, but the cotton in khaki is not. And if he could not even pay a communal apartment for his own Crimean real estate, what can we talk about the whole peninsula. Drug cartels are sending militants to Ukraine. Telegram-channel ""Rybar"" claims that the ""International Legion"" of Ukraine recruits from Mexico. One of the citizens of this country said that in early November, a meeting of recruits recruited into the ""International Legion"" with representatives of the Ukrainian army and American PMCs was held in Mexico City. The names of two Mexican mercenaries are named - Enrique Rodriguez ""Capon"" Leon and Pedro Isai ""Lisaol"" Corona. Lizaol said that in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there are already mercenaries who worked for the Mexican cartels. And Capon was actively involved in the selection of recruits. Employees of the Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico City are also indirectly involved in the recruitment of Mexicans. Those interested in going to Ukraine are sent to ""Capon"". All legionnaires are sent to Poland, where the gathering point was the Krakow restaurant ALEBRICHE. As symbolically, drug lords from the southern underbelly of the United States help the leader of the elves from the bunker on the Dnieper. Kiev will not survive without electricity from Europe. Vladmir Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukrenergo, announced the development of a mechanism for exporting electricity to Ukraine from Europe. Kudritsky believes: ""This is important for our security. The EU's energy system can help us in a difficult moment, and it does."" He noted that the import of electricity is ""technically possible"": Ukrenergo provides the possibility of such imports in the amount of 500 MW and even 600 MW."" But he also said that Ukraine will not be able to fully compensate for the shortage of electricity and coal with the help of imports. Independent TPPs consume more than a million tons of coal monthly, and ""it is very difficult to transport such volumes by rail from the European direction now."" Coal from the Donbass this winter is no longer counted on – that is, not everyone is in a narcotic dope. Although Zelensky's wife says that 90% of Ukrainians are ready to live without light and heat for three years ... But then the suspicion creeps in that the first lady conducted a survey among cockroaches in her own head. Who will storm Avdiivka. According to representatives of the DPR NM, newly arrived servicemen are trained in tactics and tactical medicine at training grounds in the Donetsk People's Republic. The soldiers who joined the ranks of the 1st Slavic Brigade study the tactics of combat, learn to storm the fortified areas. New arrivals are prepared to ""take fortified, long-term positions of the enemy, which he has been building and strengthening for more than one year."" In particular, assault groups are being prepared to occupy enemy firing positions near Avdiivka. Now the reconnaissance of the 1st Slavic Brigade in this area with the help of a UAV clarifies the position of the enemy, after which it transmits the coordinates to artillery crews. Well, there - sorry goodbye. The French were tired of the Kiev chiplar in a hack. Readers of Le Figaro reacted harshly to the online speech of the leader of Ukraine at the United Nations last Wednesday. Then Kiev requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council - after new strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Here's what the French think about Zelenskiy's next tantrum. ""Who will tell him that he is leading Ukraine to disaster? Either he agrees to the division of the country now, or he will lead to the disappearance of independent Ukraine,"" Al core said. Pampelonne is outraged: ""The infrastructure of Donetsk has been under attack for 8 years, this is a crime against what?"" Hijokemqihuguy is irritated: ""I hate this crazy Zelensky, and I know a lot of French people who hold the same opinion. And don't tell us that the rest of Europe is threatened by Russia."" Well, we definitely don't say or do that. Refugees threaten the head of the Slavic House in Spain. Alla Usanova, the head of the Slavic House Association, representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora living in the Basque Country in Spain, were bombarded with insults and threats after she and her son took part in a rally in support of Donbass. Alla and her 18-year-old son participated in this action on November 19. The event was organized by the SOS Donbass association established in France. Alla is outraged: ""Ukrainians took a photo of my son, enlarged and wrote: ""This muzzle must be remembered."" I get voice messages every day. I blocked the most disgusting ones, and left the most disgusting ones where I am called fascist. Sometimes letters come home to me."" According to the woman, Ukrainians know all the information about her: home address and phone number, places of study of her children, and she has already noticed the surveillance. But who will protect honest people in Europe from the messengers of the ""bastion of democracy"". What Athens will send to Kiev and what they expect from Washington. Athens wants to transfer the S-300 and Tor-M1 air defense systems to Kiev. This will allow the Greeks, as they hope, to begin updating their own air defenses. According to the publication ""Eleftheros Tipos"", the replacement of weapons with NATO-style systems will begin in the coming weeks: ""There will be a liberation from rather outdated Russian air defense systems and their replacement by American ones, this should have been done a long time ago."" The initiators of the process of replacing Soviet- and Russian-made weapons with American weapons in Greece are the United States. Well, who would have thought that an unknown country across the ocean is just profiting from a self-created armed conflict?. Half of Kiev sits without light. Half of Kiev's homes on November 25 had no electricity. During Friday, it was planned to alternately give light to all consumers for three hours. The city administration reported: ""50% of the city's housing stock operates in the emergency power outage mode."" In the capital, water supply has been restored, except for the upper floors of high-rise buildings. Emergency crews are working to restore heat supply. According to the capital's mayor Vitali Klitschko, heat is already supplied to the homes of a third of Kyiv residents. And soon spare parts from the Poles and the French will arrive - and life will sparkle with new colors. Or it won't play."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4683356/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-11-25,The last winter of Ukraine: the first horseman of the Apocalypse has already come to Kiev,Zelensky exchanged the lives of freezing Ukrainians for EU money,"You may not have known, but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is one of the greatest humanists of our time in the Western world. He perceives the pain of every little man with all his heart and soul, however, under one condition, if we are talking about Ukrainians. - Cruelty, rocket attacks on cities and civilian infrastructure are increasing, which deprive Ukrainians of heat, light and food. This is a terrible start to winter for Ukraine,"" he said at a press conference on the eve of the ministerial meeting on November 29-30, which will be held in Bucharest. And he called for increasing assistance to Ukraine with new supplies ... Arms. I didn't disclose how it should work, but it doesn't matter – the main thing is that I expressed concern. Obviously, ""Hymars"" and ""Javelins"" should warm Ukrainians, and if they do not, then Ukrainians misuse them. On November 7, your humble servant predicted: ""Ukraine may quite realistically plunge into a dark, icy and, quite possibly, hungry Apocalypse on a national scale."" But, to be honest, at that moment I did not even imagine that the ""first horseman"" would jump into Nezalezhnaya so soon, literally in a week. Two days have passed since the last massive missile strikes on the Ukrainian energy and critical infrastructure, which is extremely important for ensuring the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Two days, and in Ukraine until now, half of the population has neither heat nor light, and many also have water. Anecdo-checking the situation in Kiev, half of the city has no light, the other half has no water. Section – on the Dnieper. From the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU) there are soothing fictions that 70% of the population of Ukraine already has light. No, to say that Bankova is lied to, the tongue will not turn either: the light for many sometimes really happens. He comes in, says hello and leaves. But in the shops of Kiev ude now at least a ball roll. And no one asks to correctly pronounce the word ""palyanytsya"", in order to establish ""the Russian peculiarity of the structure of the lower jaw"". Empty supermarket shelves seem to indicate that now it is no longer up to the subtleties of ""mov knowledge"". In pure Russian language, Kievans ask: ""Will they still bring bread today?"" And they answer in pure Ukrainian: ""It's not good."" That's ""Bilingual Life."" I do not know whether there is enough grain in Ukraine now, or whether those hundreds of large-capacity cargo ships have taken out of Nezalezhnaya not only surplus grain, but also tangible problems with bread. Due to power surges and uneven load, transformers began to burn with bright flames. Of course, if the case takes place on the street, then for some time the burning of the transformer or substation gives the nearby Ukrainians both light and heat. But it also deprives them for a longer time. Some, even for good. Widely announced and advertised by Zelensky himself, the ""points of invincibility"" and ""fortresses of freedom"" for the most part turned out to be poorly stretched large tents and linen scarves. In Kiev, as many as 370 points were equipped. That's just the people of Kiev, who came to charge their gadgets and phones, they met with the same type of signs ""There is no electricity"". For some reason, Zelensky did not report on such features of their exploitation. By the way, Zelensky has already appealed to Western countries with a request to send fuel for diesel generators and gas to Ukraine. For some reason, such a trifle that in the conditions of the blackout fuel will also become scarce, was missed in the Office of the President on Bankova Street. How they forgot about the problem of going to the toilet in conditions. As a result, many residents of the capital of Ukraine already have to relieve themselves in plastic bags (pardon the naturalistic details) and throw the bags in dumpsters. According to the testimony of residents of the city, Kiev, which after the Maidan was flooded with homeless people with their inherent aromas, began to finally ""smell not of roses."" But in Cherkassy, for example, I work more prudent people in the communal sphere. In this regional center, 17 toilets of the ""village sorter"" type were purchased and 15 water tanks were purchased. For all, of course, there will not be enough, and the queue will have to be occupied after dark, but still... And these are the people who until recently condescended Russians that there is no urban sewerage in Russian villages. And now not every Ukrainian city has even an elementary rural one. But a completely uplifting interview was given to the BBC by the president's wife Olena Zelenskaya. ""We know that winter can be another test for us if there is no heat in our homes. And Ukrainians in the majority, it was more than 90% of respondents, answered that they are ready to endure this for two, three years, if they see the prospect of our membership in the EU. They want to be in this European family on an equal footing, - said this lady with a well-washed, unlike many today's Ukrainians, head, sitting in the warmth with light and clearly not experiencing a shortage of water and other drinks. A Kyyan (or Kuyanin – as the residents of the capital of Ukraine are now called) can be seen directly, who writhes over the package and thinks: ""I will endure two or three years, but then I will be locked up in the European Union."" The main thing is not to forget before that to stop going to the package, otherwise they will not take it for an equal. Unless, of course, in Europe they themselves are feral in the Ukrainian manner. But suddenly... Oh, it's all of a sudden. Especially wonderful when it comes to today's Ukraine. Suddenly, the tone and meaning of the statements of the speakers of the Office of the President of Ukraine have completely changed. The other day, the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko, who eight years ago prophetically advised ""to prepare for the land"", said that part of Kiev would have to be evacuated. And those who have housing or friends in the villages or suburbs were advised to negotiate and go for the winter to where there is a stove, wood and a well. He was echoed by the heads of Ukrainian energy holdings, lviv mayor Sadovyi and a number of other significant figures in Ukraine, including Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereschuk. And then, with the words ""hold my beer"", the adviser to the head of the OPU, Mikhail Podolyak, moved to the forefront. - Where to relocate a part of Kiev, where we have a territory that is not under missile attacks or has not lost its light? Where do we take a million people who have already been able to adapt in terms of severity this winter? Who understand everyone and help each other,"" he said openly that there would be no evacuation, and even appealed for patriotism. - And where to go? Once again, I ask where? Should everyone go to Poland? And who will then symbolize invincibility in this country. A notable change of rhetoric from the president's team. But the most surprising thing is that they occurred a day after the announcement that the EU had agreed to allocate 18 billion euros to Ukraine next year. And now in Ukraine, many have begun to scratch their heads, and whether the whole case with the ""millions of evacuees for the winter to Europe"" Bankova was played out specifically in order to force Europe to give money by such blackmail. And as money was given, so now no one will be evacuated anywhere. And Europe immediately calmed down... Otherwise, there will be no one to freeze in the ""points of invincibility"". From which it logically follows that no one really cares about the fate of Ukrainians at the end of the winter. And even on the contrary - the more they freeze, the angrier they will fight. As already decided and announced – to the last Ukrainian. READ ALSO. Apocalypse in the dark: the cities of Ukraine plunged into the Middle Ages, looters rob and kill in the street.

For you, as well as for so many other women in Russia whose sons are in the war zone, the attitude to this event is not only festive, but most likely associated with a sense of anxiety and care, in thoughts of what is happening to your boys, the president began. The head of the country spoke slowly, thoughtfully, choosing phrases. He himself admitted that he wanted to avoid any formalities. - I personally, and the entire leadership of the country, we share this pain. We understand that nothing can replace the loss of a son, the loss of a child, especially for a mother to whom we all owe birth. But I want you to know that we share this pain with you. And, of course, we will do everything so that you do not feel forgotten. We will do everything that depends on us, so that you feel the shoulder next to you, - Vladimir Vladimirovich promised.

But the other thing is you. Your assessments, ideas of proposals are important. I will try to make sure that they are taken into account as much as possible and used in real life,"" Putin assured.

Values and life guidelines are laid in the family, the same school is not capable of this. In the end, the president admitted that he was trying to get information directly from the soldiers. - When I talk to them sometimes - I talked to some of them on the phone, directly with the guys directly. In any case, I talked to those who also surprised me with their mood, their attitude to business. They didn't expect those calls from me. There were also calls through my moms.

A satisfied colleague grinned nearby, dressed in knee-length rubber boots. As the smartest man, he, like that icebreaker, volunteered to pave the way to the forest thicket, where we came to visit the gods of war. And at the same time get acquainted with the crews, which consist entirely of those mobilized at the front in Ukraine. Recently, relatives of those called up to the special operation zone often complain to me in Telegram about the difficult conditions at the front: ""Water is in the trenches, it rains, they sleep in dugouts."" On the one hand, civilians can be understood – they are worried about their husbands, brothers, sons. And it is difficult for a person, purely peaceful, to immediately accept that the same Donbass has been fighting in these conditions for the 9th year. On the other hand, after all, the Charter says that the soldier is obliged to ""endure all the hardships and deprivations of service."" Although this does not mean that it can be plowed like on a draft horse. With the third, as I warned at the beginning of the mobilization, no one will run after the fighter and equip his life. You will have to work with your own hands. And I have long noticed that first of all everything depends on the commander. Where a competent officer is able to organize the work of subordinates, as a rule, there are no serious problems. And where the fighters are left to their own devices, and the complaints begin. So what is the news about the special operation on November 24, 2022. - Well, yes, dirt. And where do you go from it? She doesn't help anyone on the civilian side. Okay, we cope, - with a poorly concealed smile he examined us from head to toe mobilized with the call sign ""Eagle"". After a short trip through the forest, we completely merged with the local landscape, smeared ""on the sideburns"". ""Oryol"" - from Kotovsk, Tambov region. In the ""past"" life - a builder, built shopping centers, was engaged in decoration. He says that when the summons was handed, there were not even thoughts of ""mowing"". A few weeks of training at the training ground, and now he is actually on the front line - at a distance of a shot from his ""Jeweler"". So, together with a partner from Kotovsk - one is 32 years old, the other is 38 - he named his car. - A slaughter weapon, actually - the Eagle looks respectfully at the multi-ton colossus. - Often you get in. ""And you think why we called her ""Jeweler"", - winks the partner of the ""Eagle"" with the call sign ""Golden"", in the world - a welder. - I remember a goal in particular. - We were working in the Kharkov direction then, in the area of Cossack Lopan reconnaissance gave targets. There, the enemy was seriously strengthened, concreted. Well, in short, break them. The scouts then thanked us by communication. - You work closely with them. - Well, of course. They give us the coordinates. This is an example, as they say, of working online. The special forces of the Western Military District in the course of reconnaissance identify targets and immediately, bypassing the complex system of hierarchy and subordination, transmit data to artillerymen. Who are ready to strike in two minutes. ""We have a Tulip crew (the largest mortar in the world - caliber 240 millimeters) from the mobilized, which is preparing to fire three times faster than the standard,"" the accompanying officer leads us around the camp. There is an opportunity to see how the fighters live in the conditions of autumn rasputitsa. Tents-""barracks"" are scattered throughout the forest. There is a shower, a bath and a ""café"" where we are treated to the remains of barbecue - the day before the guys modestly celebrated the day of artillery. On stretched ropes in the pouring rain, the washed form is ""dried"". It looks infernal. I remember how for many years I was engaged in military archeology at the sites of the battles of the Great Patriotic War in the Novgorod region. There, in the swamps, where the Second Shock Army perished. I was always amazed at how our grandfathers managed to fight in such unbearable conditions - constant dampness, cold, all the ""charms"" of forest life - from gnats to chuckles under your feet, which is trying to suck your boot. And you stand in the midst of all this ""splendor"", look at ordinary Russian men who have become real soldiers as an extern, and understand what genes are in their practical expression. And here is the same record-breaking crew. Zhenk is a modest man from the village of Verkhny Shibryay, also in the Tambov region. He was a farm labourer and now serves mines half his height. He admits that at first it was unusual and even scary. But then I got used to it. - How much do you shoot on average per day? Eugene asks. -Ten. - That's a lot. - I don't think so. More is possible. There is a desire. - You would see how happy they are when they are informed that targets have been hit. Really like children, - admits the attendant. - And in terms of professional qualities, they can no longer be distinguished from personnel calculations. Sometimes they can give a head start. At that moment, something was noisy outside the walls of the ""café"". It was as if someone abruptly turned on the sound of the waterfall. Increased rain broke through a small dam somewhere and streams of water flowed throughout the camp. ""Well, we'll rearrange the tents again,"" one of the fighters standing next to him shrugged. And he said it as if he was going to go to the next house for bread. - So if we did it a second time or a third time... We do not stay in one place for a long time. We have had so many of these moves that one more, one less. Guys are standing, as they say, on a breakthrough direction. The Svatovsky frontier has become a new ""serif line"" in front of the territory of the Lugansk People's Republic, which the enemy has been trying to break through for several months. He planned to occupy the city of Svatovo on October 17, but something went wrong. The defense line in Ukraine began to be saturated with equipment and mobilized help, which was able to stop the onslaught of the enemy. Today, endless columns of civilian trucks are marching towards the Svatovsky frontier. Some carry concrete cones, from which impassable barriers are formed, others - building materials, from which fortifications and residential dugouts are erected. Tractors, excavators, cranes work in the fields... Not a soldier with a shovel, but civilian builders who erect lines of defense according to all the canons of military science. - How does the enemy behave? - I ask the fighter in one of the positions. - Periodically tries my hand. Trying, of course, to get around from the flanks. So far, everything is generally fine, receiving a decent rebuff. - You've been fighting for a long time. - Eight months. Back in 2014, he fought. I am a local, from Krasny Luch. Volodymyr Savchenko. I was both an adviser to the first head of the republic and an assistant to the second. And he worked in the mine. Management, but underground. And in the city administration. As they say, where the Motherland demanded, there was a demand. - And I got here on the agenda. -Volunteer. I was a member of the resistance, helping to organize the 2014 referendum. Well, now, rewind and destroy what was created with your own hands? What is the motivation? That's it! My wife is also an officer. How can she relate to that? As it should be. Of course, with emotion. This is a woman, such moments – from delight to tears one step. ""Our situation is consistently difficult,"" says a battalion commander standing nearby with the call sign ""Oskol"" and twenty concussions behind his shoulders. - In principle, almost every day the enemy tries to break through, they do not spare their strength at all, they do not spare their people ... Sometimes, there is intense artillery fire. Under the noise, they approach in groups, one goes on the attack, the second waits. When they run out of ammunition, the second group is included in the battle. Well, and so they try to push. - The weather greatly affects the course of hostilities. -Dirty. Very dirty... There is water in the trenches. Now the guys are eliminating it with all their might. People, of course, are tired. But on the other side, the sun is not shining. Behind the combatant, the soldiers shoveled through the drainage channels so that the water left the trenches. Apparently, until the ground freezes, the enemy will not take serious offensive actions. Although after the Russian troops were withdrawn from Kherson, Kiev transferred part of its forces from there just to the Svatov direction. The enemy does not lose hope of wedged into the territory of the LPR. Subscribe to the new podcasts of Dmitry ""Goblin"" Puchkov and listen when it is convenient!"

The decision to start it was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to protect the residents of Donbass from the genocide of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The website KP.RU online publishes the latest news about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on November 25, 2022. The Armed Forces of Ukraine forcibly mobilize and send to the front residents of the Russian-speaking regions of the country. The Russian Defense Ministry with new massive strikes on infrastructure facilities actually deprived Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his subordinates of the opportunity to transfer the reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the front line. At the same time, as noted in the Russian military department, no strikes were inflicted on Kiev itself, and all the destruction in residential buildings was the result of the use of American air defense systems by the Ukrainian army. As a result of the exchange, another 50 servicemen returned to Russia from Ukrainian captivity. In the footage published by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the soldiers thank for returning home."

But he reassured that there are no plans to resettle Kievans to the west of the country or beyond its borders. The mayor suggested that citizens stock up on technical and drinking water, food supplies that can be cooked without electricity, warm clothes, charged laptops and powerbanks. Well, he added that in the case of a bad scenario (is a good one possible?), it would be good if every Kievan had the opportunity to go to the dacha, where there is water and a stove, or to his friends (who definitely have it). Digging wells in Podil and burning textbooks with desks on Khreshchatyk is not yet proposed - not bad. Mikhail Zabrodsky, the ex-commander of the independent Airborne Forces, revealed a ""terrible secret"" to the British edition of The Economist. The lieutenant general whispered to British journalists that Kiev has long been carefully preparing an operation to return Crimea by 2023. True, he did not give out a specific date for the start of the operation even to the envoys of Foggy Albion. But, since there is only a month left before the onset of this year, I could have chopped with a sword: they say, ""we will parachute in December""! But Zabrodsky, mysteriously squinting his eyes, added only that first you need to ""win a lot of battles,"" and you should not waste time worrying about plans in social networks and on TV. This commander, who graduated from the Engineering and Space Academy in St. Petersburg and served five years under contract in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, then, finding himself in the 95th Airmobile Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, seems to have landed his head during an unsuccessful landing. And more than once – and not only in the ATO zone. Tomasz Szatowski, Poland's ambassador to NATO, rings the bells: warehouses in Europe with weapons and equipment are being emptied before our eyes due to the reckless dispatch of trains to the independent country. Shatkovsky sadly stated that the members of the alliance are less and less actively transferring weapons to Ukraine, including due to the fact that warehouses began to empty in many countries of Eastern and Central Europe. The diplomat creaked and acknowledged the ""fatigue of public opinion"" from the Ukrainian topic and the need to continuously send something to Kiev. So you are, in the words of a French classic, ""responsible for those who have been tamed."" The administration of Enerhodar said that the territory of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remains under the control of the Russian military. They provide the station with complete safety. The city administration notes that the media controlled by Kiev spread fakes, whose information does not correspond to reality: ""The operational safety of the nuclear power plant is fully ensured. Largely due to its staff, who understand that this is the territory of Russia, this is serious and for a long time. "" Later, the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, when asked whether there are signs of the withdrawal of Russian troops from Enerhodar, said: ""There is no need to look for any signs where they do not exist and cannot be."" In general, it is not the case when ""he who seeks, he will always find."" Valery Limarenko, the governor of Sakhalin, said the wives and mothers of volunteers from Russia's largest eastern island would go on a business trip to the Donbas. The head of the region stressed that the authorities will cover all the costs of the trip. Limarenko explained that sending relatives of fighters to the SVO zone is necessary to ""provide them with more targeted and effective assistance."" Limarenko said: ""I am sure that women will be very careful to ensure that the requests of the fighters are fulfilled exactly, and the parcels quickly get to the addressees, since we are talking about their sons and husbands. The first to go on a business trip will be a resident of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Irina Nigmatulina. "" Yuriy Duchenko, one of the leaders of the All-Ukrainian Association of Bakers, stated that the technology of making bread in self-style is regularly violated during constant power outages. Dudchenko said: ""There is a cycle of production of different varieties of bread, where the process from serving flour to packaging takes more than 6 hours. To interrupt this process at any stage or to stop the oven is to send the whole batch, tons of bread, for disposal. "" At the same time, work on generators can only support the vital activity of enterprises during emergency shutdowns. But it is impossible to produce bread in sufficient quantities on generators. There are two ways out - either the power to change, or to switch to tandoors. Olga Zykova, deputy finance minister, said the government had expressed a wish to Washington that direct tranches to the Ukrainian budget from the United States, starting in January, would amount to at least $1.1 billion every month. Zykova said: ""We are holding direct talks with the US Treasury. The White House has submitted a proposal for approval by the US Congress, which is a package of $ 37.7 billion for comprehensive support. "" That is, Kiev admitted that until they were accepted into the EU (in two years, as promised by the Minister of Finance of the independent), they will gladly become the 51st US state. And the Americans didn't know. The FSB reported: a series of terrorist attacks was prevented in the Zaporozhye region. In Melitopol, three citizens of Ukraine were detained. They were on their way to the site of the explosive device in one of the city's markets. The FSB DSP explained: ""Two of them, previously convicted of committing serious crimes on the territory of Ukraine, gave confessions that they acted on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services. The goal is to intimidate the civilian population of the Zaporizhzhya region."" Components of an improvised explosive device based on plasticite and electric detonators were seized in the detainees' car, and two pistols with ammunition and a grenade with a fuse were seized in the apartments. To go to the market with a bomb is not for you to buy. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said that in six months he would make a direct connection from the embankment of Yalta. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev reacted in social networks as follows: ""Ukrainian smokers continue to dream of direct video inclusions from Yalta and other places. You can organize that. Directly from the pre-trial detention center in Crimea. Although the most advanced will be able to organize a communication session from Lefortovo. It is better to use insulators in the south. Subscribe to the new podcasts of Dmitry ""Goblin"" Puchkov and listen when it is convenient!"

During the landing in the train, more than 100 Ukrainian servicemen were killed. The official representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia also listed the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in certain areas of hostilities: more than 50 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in the Kupyansk direction, more than 30 in the Krasno-Limansky direction, up to 80 in the Artemovsky direction, more than 50 in the South-Donetsk direction. Dozens of Ukrainian tanks, armored fighting vehicles and infantry vehicles were burned in the battles.

In short, it turned out that the armies of the West are not ready for a real big confrontation. NATO is used to nightmarishing poor countries like Afghanistan, and there is simply no need for a lot of weapons. A NATO spokesman told U.S. reporters that ""the small countries of the bloc have fully exhausted their potential, and 20 of the 30 members have significantly exhausted themselves."" Although the richest – the United States, France, Germany, Italy – are still able to support Kiev. But even then , Paris handed over to Ukraine 18 Caesar howitzers. And this is already a fifth of all stocks of such guns in the country, and France will not give them to Zelensky anymore. You have to. U.S. reserves in Europe have also almost run out. And they are not going to replenish them yet - it is more important for Washington to keep reserves near China and North Korea, and not near Ukraine. It turns out that we are no longer fighting with the entire alliance, but only with its main countries, whose reserves turned out to be thicker. The NYT wrote that in NATO, the European military is jokingly called the ""bonsai army."" Like tiny Japanese trees. Because there are shells for cannons, air defense missiles, ammunition in the EU, but they are few. In Afghanistan, according to a New York newspaper, NATO could fire 300 cannons a day. Now Ukraine alone produces 6-7 thousand (!) shells per day. And our army (according to NATO military estimates) spends 40-50 thousand rounds of ammunition per day. At the same time, in the entire United States, 15 thousand of them are made per month. In general, the modern battlefield turned out to be too much for the Anglo-Saxon generals. And then there's the commerce... It turned out that shells from one country of the bloc are not suitable for the same type of weapons from another. Take the same heavy guns. Yes, the caliber of all is standard: 155 mm. But the German shell will not fit into the French howitzer. So manufacturers guarantee that they will be able to sell ammunition for their weapons, as printer manufacturers make money on branded cartridges.

(Which, in fact, we agreed with him in advance.. Let me remind you: he served 13 years in the army, was a paratrooper, went through two Chechen wars, received a concussion, since 2019 he worked as the head of Chita, and a few days ago he wrote a letter of resignation to go to help the participants of a special military operation. Now Senior Warrant Officer Sapozhnikov is undergoing training in one of the assembly military points. Here is our conversation - almost verbatim. ... - Alexander Mikhailovich,  First, tell me you've read it all, right? I have sent you all the publications of Komsomolka, including on our website, and the radio program Komsomolskaya Pravda. -Yes of course. - That's right, I've complied with all your requests, yes. - Thank you very much, yes. - Even with Dmitry Peskov, with the press secretary of the President of Russia, I discussed your act. - Heard, seen, read. Nice very. - You know, that's a very big response. They call me, they write to me – say hello to Alexander, give me a big thank you, he surprised everyone, amazed everyone. What would you like to answer to the listeners, visitors of our site, our readers. - To be honest, I myself did not expect such attention to myself. And I called you to express gratitude for the kind words, for the support, for the sincerity. In these words there is also faith in our Victory, in our great power, uniting all of us. You know, in a difficult moment, we came together. Everybody came together. And this is visible to the naked eye. Our country is multinational. We live in friendship, harmony and love, we treat each other very respectfully. This is very important. And this must be preserved in the future. Forever. And to everyone who read and listened to us in Komsomolka, in the newspaper, on the website and on the radio, I would like to wish light and comfort in the houses, and the most important thing - love, health and prosperity. All the people who sincerely say this are people with good hearts. These are real people, real patriots. -I agree. - To be honest, I'll say one more thing... Now almost every night they send me bad text messages from Ukraine... But I'm not afraid of their threats. - So, how did they know your phone. - Yes, they even sent me a copy of my passport - with my address. - Tell me what they write. (Sapozhnikov talks about some sms messages that we will not publish here, of course. - You, of course, do not answer them. - In no case - erase or block. - You can now answer directly through us. Or we will not. - And why? Ordinary Nazi propaganda. And I would like to answer our Chinese friends - thank you for their support.

The main goal of the SVO, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is to protect the residents of Donbass from genocide by the Ukrainian military and neo-Nazi militants. The website KP.RU online publishes the latest news about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on November 29, 2022. The head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov in his official Telegram channel said that the Chechen special forces managed to find dozens of caches in the Kherson region. In these caches were found machine guns, disposable grenade launchers, machine guns, shots to grenade launchers and much more. In the battles near Artemivsk (Bakhmut) in the Donetsk region, the Ukrainian military suffer huge losses, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing doctors and eyewitnesses. According to the publication only on Friday, about 50 people were admitted to local hospitals, on Thursday - 240.

As Bloomberg reported, citing its sources, the Russian authorities are preparing a presidential decree prohibiting Russian companies and any traders who are engaged in Russian oil from selling it to anyone who joins the ""price ceiling"" set by the West for Russian oil. The decree will prohibit doing business with both companies and countries that have supported the price ceiling. It will also be prohibited to load on ships oil destined for any countries that accept restrictions, whatever price range is chosen. It is touching that Western countries have been ""breaking spears"" for the second week, trying to determine this ""ceiling"". For example, Greece and Malta propose to set it at the level of 60-70 US dollars per barrel (excluding the cost of transportation), and Poland and Ukraine insist on 30 bucks per barrel. Calm down, right word. At least 150 dollars, if it is indicated at least a word about the price restrictions in the contract, you will not get for any money. It will be like Zhvanetsky: ""Let's argue about the taste of oysters with those who ate them. To the hoarseness, to the fight."" SHMYGAL AND ZELENSKY – WHO LIES. Two completely different assessments on the evening of November 26 were issued by the President of Ukraine (so far) Volodymyr Zelensky and the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal. Zelensky in his video message said that in 14 regions of Ukraine and in Kiev, restrictions on electricity for more than 100 thousand subscribers in each region continue to operate. But the Prime Minister reported completely different figures. - The entire main high-voltage infrastructure is working, but problems persist in the distribution networks of oblenergo throughout the state. On average, from 200 to 400 thousand consumers are de-energized in each region, Shmygal said. And who is right in this situation? Don't believe it – Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. - At some point, an empty refrigerator can beat the TV. No matter how much you say that everything is fine with us, people will understand that everything is not so good in our country,"" the mayor of the capital of Ukraine said on television, who prophetically advised Ukrainians to ""prepare for the land"" in the winter of 2014 and explained that in order to get warm water, it must be heated. And he wasn't listened to. THE EUROPEAN UNION GAVE SERBIA AN ULTIMATUM. Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said that Brussels has set two mutually exclusive conditions for the republic's accession to the EU, which Serbia must fulfill. The first is to impose sanctions against Russia, because ""Russia has violated the territorial integrity of another state."" And the second is to recognize the independence of Kosovo, despite the fact that such recognition is a direct violation of the territorial integrity of Serbia itself. Serbs are now in deep bewilderment, because they do not know how to simultaneously fulfill two such conditions, and who to go to – to the smart or the beautiful? KIEV ANNOUNCED A BOYCOTT OF PACE. AND DON'T TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. The Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has declared a strike. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Nikita Poturaev, announced that Ukrainian deputies-delegates to PACE will stop working in this organization until the Assembly decides on the suspension of Russian representatives from participation in PACE. - The delegation decided to boycott the work of Ukraine in this international organization until such a solution is found. We were also supported by friends and allies from Estonia and Lithuania, who were also present and left the meeting of the Standing Committee with us,"" Poturaev told reporters. Perhaps Ukrainians were simply frightened by the darkness, since ""the final meeting of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Warsaw began in the dark. As a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, the lights were turned off in the hall."" And Ukrainians might have thought that now they would also cut down the heat, and become quite like at home. KULEBA PROBOLTALS. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba unexpectedly in an interview with the French edition of Le Parisien revealed a Ukrainian ""military secret"". According to him, a number of countries quietly provide military assistance to Kiev, supplying Ukraine with weapons or purchasing them and sending them through third countries. ""Most of these third countries say publicly that they don't supply anything, but behind the scenes everything is happening,"" Kuleba told reporters and most likely took a promise from them not to share this secret knowledge with anyone. It is possible that some such cases do occur. For example, Bulgarian arms dealers supplied Kiev with shells with an expired shelf life for ""Soviet calibers"" at a triple price. Even explosions at factories in Bulgaria were staged to hide supplies. And the Westerners had to push through official deliveries from March to November, and it is not a fact that the consent of the parliament, which was obtained, will be implemented. DOWN WITH METAL. The largest mining and metallurgical plant of Ukraine ""ArcelorMittal"" stopped steel smelting and production of rolled products. It is announced that this is done due to problems with electricity. Representatives of the company reported that the available volumes of electricity are not enough to maintain production even at the level of 20% of capacity. And this is in conditions when due to the increased cost of electricity in Europe, its own metallurgical production has decreased, and the EU countries are ready to buy more Ukrainian metal, even despite the increased price. And there is nothing to buy, as it turned out. THE MAYOR OF KHARKIV IS READY FOR A FINE. The mayor of this city, Igor Terekhov, who was fined for addressing the residents of Kharkiv in Russian language, said that he would continue to communicate with the residents of the city in Russian language, which is native to 80% of the local population. But he stressed that this does not affect the level of his Ukrainian patriotism. - Today, the most important thing for us is to win. No matter what language we speak, Terekhov promised. Stubborn but bad. After all, if these people win, then you, the mayor, will no longer be fined. They will just shoot and throw them into a pit, as in the same Kupyansk. They won't even bury it for the edification of others. ONE LINE. - Director of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Yevhen Golovakha announced that according to the polls of his institution, Vladimir Putin has ceased to be the most popular politician in Ukraine. Yes quit, it's temporary. - About half of the ""invincibility points"" in Kiev, where residents could warm up, drink tea and charge their gadgets, announced by Zelensky, turned out to be non-working and closed due to lack of electricity. - From the Office of the President of Ukraine in the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff and the Ministry of Internal Affairs received an urgent recommendation not to install Ukrainian flags on the graves of those killed at the front. And then the picture with these ""seas of flags"" is not at all about the help and does not motivate, but demotivates the population. - France and the United Kingdom are offended that the United States is dragging tax breaks and promises of support to industrial enterprises from Europe to its country, and are preparing a joint response to unfriendly policies to Washington. ""On the fourth day, the Keen Falcon noticed that the barn in which they were put by the cursed gringos did not have one wall."" - The new chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine Andriy Pyshny tightens the requirements for banks and arranges deliveries in the financial market to ""foreign"" banks, requiring them to buy bonds of the domestic state loan of Ukraine (OGVZ), from which bankers flee like a plague. - In Switzerland, Ukrainians who found themselves in this country stopped accepting hryvnia cash for exchange for francs. And where to go now with these hryvnias. Not to return to Ukraine. - British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace at a meeting in Kiev with Zelensky, without taking his hands out of his pockets, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine should undertake a decisive offensive in the winter, since they were provided with ""Arctic equipment"", and they are well trained. They will still bill for each rag if there is anyone. - According to Western experts, about a third of the howitzers supplied by the West to Ukraine are no longer suitable for firing and require urgent repairs.

But they were saved and made the best in the world.","The secrets of Russian weapons, from ""Kalibr"", ""Daggers"" and ""Iskanders"", to the most perfect sniper rifle ""Sumrak"", reveals the military observer of ""KP"" Viktor Baranets","It turns out that the creation of our legendary missiles, fighters and even rifles was accompanied by such dramas and intrigues that they were ready to go under the knife. And now we're proud of them. Here, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin dropped a fat compliment in our direction. ""The Russians have impressive weapons."" And this happens extremely rarely with jealous Americans in uniform and without. Although it was said through the teeth, but on that thank you. And the truth is that we have a lot of unique military equipment. Moreover, not only generously advertised on the lacquered pages of advertising magazines, but tested in battles - both in Syria and in the special operation in Ukraine. But what is curious: the fate of some weapons hung in the balance. And even those that we are proud of today. Well, how it was. SLITBAN MASK. Back in the spring, American billionaire Elon Musk planted a fat space pig on us – he made his Starlink satellite communication system plow for US intelligence and the Ukrainian army. They began to receive data online for pointing drones, missiles and guns at Russian positions in Ukraine. And then suddenly there was a breakdown: Starlink stopped furying over those areas of Ukraine where there was active fighting. Kiev generals shouted: they say, this is either a mistake of the Pentagon, or Musk switched to the side of Moscow, deliberately ""dropped the network"" to help Russia. One of them admitted: ""Starlink is our oxygen. If Musk leaves, our army will be in chaos."" Ukrainian specialists started talking about ""incomprehensible mass problems"" not only with the Internet, but also with military communications. As soon as the signals from starlink satellites began to ""disappear"", the Ukrainians stopped receiving important intelligence and sharply reduced the number of their attacks. And those troops of Ukraine who were left without communication and the ""field Internet"" began to suffer heavy losses. Musk himself also shed a tear: he admitted that Starlink's work in Ukraine is under threat. And... Here's the attention: it turns out that these are Russian electronic warfare (electronic warfare) systems ""actively trying to kill Starlink"". And they can finally break this system. The name of the ""pest"" that turned off Musk's satellites over the special operation zone is already known. This is the Russian EW complex ""Tirada-2S"". It was created to jam enemy communication satellites. He is helped by a system that warns of a missile attack. Having received data from her, Tirada jams Musk's satellites with pulses of the desired frequency. The result is that the connection between space and ground terminals is cut off. After that, the multi-star British general Michael Wigston said that in the future, due to the stunning development of russian electronic warfare, not only the American Starlink and its English ""colleague"" OneWeb would work poorly. The general was wrong in his predictions - the future has already come. Although the 20-year history of the creation of ""Tirade"" is complex and dramatic. There were periods when the design work on the project ""lost its pulse"". There was no money. There were scientific and technological ""dead ends"". And customers have already preferred a different system. But the specialists of the Moscow Research Radio Engineering Institute and Progress JSC were able to save, defend and bring it to mind. Vladislav Korolev, a member of the project, told me. - Tirada-2S is capable of interrupting any satellite communication within a radius of tens of kilometers, completely making the spacecraft inactive. Its main weapon is a narrow beam aimed at the frequency of the satellite communication channel and creating special interference that interferes with the transmission of the signal to the addressee. No matter how incredible noise immunity the satellite has, it will still spend all its energy on desperate attempts to break through the electromagnetic curtain. But he will not be able to bypass the ""Tirade"". VICTORIOUS DOUBT. In no less dramatic scientific and technical torment, our laser gun ""Peresvet"" was born, which today is also on the battlefield. How many times did the highbrow luminaries sentence him to death. Russian academician Yevgeny Alexandrov stated that ""theoretically, such a laser could be created, but subject to the use of very difficult and cumbersome solutions."" He doubted that it would be possible to make and even more so - to adopt the Peresvet. Other prominent scientists also gave in to him: they say, the creation of this laser gun is a waste of brains, time and money. You can't fool the laws of physics. Such installations consume too much energy, ""so it is unlikely to use them as an effective portable tool."" And yet it worked! According to Yuri Borisov, the former deputy prime minister who oversaw the defense industry, Peresvet can ""blind all satellite reconnaissance systems of the enemy in orbits up to 1500 kilometers."" THE RESURRECTED HEIR OF ""OKI. But in the history of the creation of domestic weapons, there are many sad examples when unique samples were still lost. This happened both for political and economic reasons. And sometimes because of the adventurous stupidity of some leaders, which bordered on betrayal. But it was all presented as ""new thinking"" (remember those favorite words of Mikhail Gorbachev?). And under Boris Yeltsin, many gaps in the country's defense were broken. We abandoned the Buran space shuttle. From combat railway missile systems. From heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers (having allowed them to be sold behind the cordon, 1 out of 9 in the Navy ranks were left). Mikhail Sergeevich, at the insistent request of the United States, ordered to ""put under pressure"" the OTR-23 Oka operational-tactical missile system. 106 launchers of this complex were blown up. The technological line was also dismantled, and even the equipment for the production of Oka was destroyed. But thank God - the school of the brilliant designer Sergey invincible has been preserved! Another time came and his students created an even more effective missile system. Now everyone knows him as the famous Iskander. He's also at the front today. On his combat account - dozens of headquarters and ammunition depots of the enemy destroyed by high-precision strikes (I myself witnessed how during the tests from a distance of 500 km the missile of this complex hit the peg). The American press calls the Iskander the most dangerous (after nuclear) weapons of Russia. And Ukrainian generals ""complain"" that the Iskander missile is extremely difficult to intercept even with the help of modern missile defense systems sent to Kiev by NATO countries. AMERICAN BANDWAGON. The fate of our newest, already overgrown with legends, hypersonic complex ""Dagger"" was very difficult. By the way, on March 18, during a special operation, his debut took place - the first combat use. A Kinzhala missile sniped a large repository of Ukrainian and foreign missiles hidden deep in a mine (Ivano-Frankivsk region). As you know, the ""Dagger"" is attached to the belly of the MiG-31 fighter. Back in the second half of the 1980s, the installation batch of this combat vehicle was built at the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod. There it gathered dust until March 1992, when it was shown to the military-political leadership of Russia. The leadership clapped their hands and approved further tests of the fighter, which continued until the spring of 1994. Then Mikoyan's OKB reported to the Kremlin on the successful completion of the tests, and in response received a telegram from Yeltsin congratulating both the firm itself and its subcontractors. Everyone was waiting for the plane to go into production. But Russia of the mid-90s such an aircraft ... was not needed. Production of the MiG-31 was stopped. In addition, the shares of the Perm Motor Plant (PMZ), which created engines for it, ended up in the hands of the Americans! And the plant stopped the production of such power plants. Why? The Americans ""wagged their tail"": they say, there are no unique engines of increased power D-30F6. But that was a lie. The commission that arrived from Moscow ""scraped it down"" and found out that the plant and its storage bases had 600 such engines! This made it possible to ensure the production of at least 300 MiGs-31. Which was done. Little by little, the MiG-31 began to appear in combat formation. Looking at their high characteristics, the golden heads of our defense industry proposed to combine the hypersonic ""Dagger"" with the aircraft into one complex. Although to cross a ballistic missile and an air launch is a very difficult engineering task. But it was solved. And the fighter became a kind of acceleration platform for the missile. Moreover, the new missile did not need to be ""invented"" - the Iskander was taken as a basis. It, of course, was modernized. They achieved a range of destruction - 2 thousand kilometers, and a speed of up to 14.7 thousand km / h. A possible deviation from the center of the target is only 1.5 meters. Moreover, the warhead is controlled throughout the flight path using aerodynamic rudders and shunting micromotors. Therefore, a rocket that makes unpredictable maneuvers in flight is difficult to hit. ""Dagger"" is the most common missile. But it cannot be shot down,"" US President Joe Biden once said about our miracle weapon. And this amused even those who have long been accustomed to the ridiculous statements of the head of the White House. ""PUTIN'S LONG SWORD. The Russian Kalibr cruise missile has already become a real hit. Especially now, when it is super successfully used in a special operation in Ukraine. ""Calibrating"" the enemy is almost the most fashionable expression now in the troops. Back in 2015, when Russia first used Kalibr in Syria, Western experts were shocked by their accuracy: the circular deviation from targets, which are 2500 kilometers from the launch site, was no more than 3 meters. For this reason, abroad, the missile was nicknamed ""Putin's long sword."" But in the history of the creation of this formidable weapon there was a moment when its development was slowed down ... Ukrainian competitors from the Zaporozhye plant ""Motor-Sich"". They produced rocket engines. Time passed, and the ""heart"" of the rocket remained on paper. And it remains to be seen how many years it would have remained there if the people from the Rybinsk Saturn plant had not taken up the cause. Here's how its former director Yuri Lastochkin told about it. - It was clear to us that sooner or later Russia would need its own rocket engine. Chance helped. In 2000, Putin came to the Saturn, and I reported to him that we were ready, but the matter was slowed down by the ordering missile department of our Ministry of Defense. To which Putin replied briefly and with a smile: ""Addresses? Turnout? Let's get wet!"" I thought he was joking. But by the way the faces of the retinue – the then profile Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov and the head of Roscosmos Koptev – changed , it became clear that the result would be. And so it happened. Things have gotten off the ground. Features of the Kalibr missile not only in a powerful engine or in a mighty (500 kg!) warhead, but also in a unique navigation system, in built-in means of countering enemy air defense. ""Caliber"" does not fly in a straight trajectory, but changes it depending on the terrain and the observed enemy anti-aircraft systems. If the kalibr electronics detect the radiation of someone else's air defense or electronic warfare, the missile instantly changes the trajectory and rebuilds the flight route. ""GLOOMY"" IS A NUGGET. Not so long ago, a unique weapon appeared in our troops fighting in Ukraine - the Sumrak sniper rifle. Today it is considered the best in the world. First of all, according to the main indicators - accuracy and firing range - 4,210 meters. And they made a rifle about 10 years ago not in some cool weapons company, but at a private enterprise ""Design Bureau of Integrated Systems"". It is in Tarusa, in the Kaluga region. Its owner is a Russian gun nugget Vladislav Lobaev. He once assembled a talented team, found sponsors, purchased equipment and launched the production of sniper rifles. It's gone. And very successfully. ""Goods"" in the Russian and foreign markets were in high demand, revenues grew every year. Specialists from the Ministry of Defense began to visit Lobaev, everything went to the orders of the military department. But that didn't happen. Lobaev's firm was not renewed the license for sniper rifles (there are rumors that these were the tricks of competitors). Lobaev did not bang his head against the wall, and with all his team (and equipment) moved to the United Arab Emirates. And there I continued to develop. The rifles he created are in service with the Royal Guards and elite units of the UAE Army. And not only that. There were many people who wanted to buy unparalleled weapons for snipers from other countries. And here the Moscow generals began to ""scratch the turnip"". It did not take long to persuade Lobayev to return to his homeland. And his unique rifles (not only ""Twilight"") began to appear without any delay in the combat formations of our troops. It is said that one sniper from this rifle ""threshed"" so many enemies that he was awarded the title of Hero for this.

That's serious, right? No, we know that the Ukrainian command and authorities say whenever their air defenses are triggered abnormally and slap on their own homes, often also with residents, that it is the Russians who have run out of Kalibr missiles, so they shoot at Ukrainian targets with S-300 PVS missiles. But that a rocket flying at a speed of 2,000 meters per second (or even a little more) can be shot down from the DShK, is this serious? It is clear that for Ukraine, where drones shoot down housewives with cans of homemade pickles, and some grandfather even ""landed"" a Su-34 with a shot from a Bandera cut, any possible fantasy is considered a reality, but at least some semblance of plausibility tried to preserve even the most famous liar in the world, Baron Carl Jerome, in general, you understood that we are talking about Munchausen. True, this was before the emergence of Ukraine, and now the baron would hang himself from envy and a sense of his own worthlessness. Missile defense was strengthened by an anti-missile ""kulemet"" (a machine gun, if anyone does not know, in Ukrainian). ""Ukrovoeny"", especially from territorial defense, even subsonic ""Kalibr"" are escorted, opening their mouths, and here the S-300 is on supersonic. You wouldn't even have time to see it. And where, by the way, did the Russian S-300 come from near Odessa? If they fly at ground targets, at most, for 40 kilometers, and then when very lucky. Where was this Russian S-300 launched in this case? On what part of the front did the Russian troops come to a distance of forty kilometers to Odessa. Why are both General Staffs silent on this issue. Apparently, if any such fact took place, it was only in this version of what happened. Ukrainian air defenses fired the S-300, probably targeting some object in the sky. The missile went abnormally, but in this case, fortunately, the self-liquidator worked, or they could have been sent to Romania according to the ""Polish scenario"". The Theroboronians who saw this toast recorded this on their combat account. Kind of like those junior high school students who used pea guns to help the ""elusive avengers"" in a movie theater. And after catching up with the school principal, they agreed that ""healthy they helped the elusive."" And what can you do, the country needs heroes... And in the dreamers of ""high in Ukrainian"". Here on Ukrainian television, the secretary of the Lviv City Council, Markiyan Lopachak, promised to put up for auction the Moscow Kremlin when Ukraine receives ownership of Moscow's property. He still has 70% of Lviv's population without electricity, and he dreams of selling the Kremlin. Or is it a necessary condition to repair the energy system with the proceeds from the sale of the Kremlin and give light to Lviv residents? First the money, then the repairs.

But who will replace it? Do we have great scientists, entertainers and artists? There is, the director of Mosfilm, film director Karen Shakhnazarov, is sure","- Karen Georgievich, in recent days we have seen several videos of Ukrainian soldiers killing Russians who have surrendered. On the other hand, after the missile strikes on Ukraine, especially zealous Russians have almost euphoria: ""Nehai khokhly will freeze!"" After all, yesterday - 30 years ago - they were really one people. -Scares. But it's such an inevitable danger. Each side considers the other a traitor. That is, not just an enemy, but also a traitor, a renegade. - Does this need to be dealt with in some way? To the state, to public figures? To reassure, to remember about internationalism. - They shot our prisoners of war. And it's one thing that we here in Moscow think about this, and it's quite another thing what our soldiers and officers there feel. They have a very different truth. So it's hard to do about it. I think that the best solution is to finish everything as soon as possible, to inflict a decisive defeat on the opposing side. - In the news, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg once again declares that there will be no lasting peace in Ukraine if Russia wins. - They bet too much on this confrontation. For them, Ukraine's defeat is also their defeat. And it is their strategic mistake to turn the conflict into such a fundamental one for themselves, for them. But the same goes for us. For us, defeat is also fraught with the most serious consequences. - And it could have been different. - They could not turn this conflict into such an existential one for themselves. That is, raising the question of existence itself. But we decided to go all in. So for them, Ukraine's defeat is their defeat, followed by a weakening of their influence. This will prove that the Western world is not able to control the situation on the planet. And this physical thought is followed by purely economic consequences. When Akella misses, the pack will not follow him. And that's a crash. - A law banning gay propaganda was passed. Do you think it's appropriate. - It's funny that the issue of fighting gays has become such a world issue. To a certain extent, it can cause some internal rupture in our country among different groups of the population. Therefore, we must treat it very carefully. But, indeed, this gay story has become somewhat maniacal in the West. Almost the most important topic of the modern world. As an old Marxist, I look at this as part of bourgeois culture – looking for class interests. I think that such unrestrained propaganda of this topic is connected with the desire of the modern bourgeoisie to distract the proletariat and the toiling peasantry from the true problems of mankind. - And our ""bourgeois parliament"" adopted a ban. - The paradox is that we, fighting with the West, say that we have no ideology. But it's there. And in fact, it is bourgeois-liberal, that is, the same as that of the West. And our current allies are left-wing, communist movements. - As in soviet times. - Yes, but then everything was clear: the USSR is an ideological antipode. Not today. So you are right, our bourgeois elite is forced to go to such a conflict. - If from the point of view of the idea we are complete like-minded people, then there is such a fight around. - And we are talking about the place that we occupy in the hierarchy. The West doesn't like that we want a special place. So we entered their world in 1991, adopted an ideology, a system of values, and then said: ""We want to sit at the same table with you."" And they don't want to. By the way, I think this is our problem with Ukraine: we do not offer them any other ideology, view of the world, social order. And they say, ""It's better then to do the same thing, but with the West, not with you."" This is a very difficult situation for us. - But in the West they believe that we have the wrong capitalism. - But we don't think so. The people themselves chose it. Now they say we were deceived, but to this I will say: guys, you had to think with your head! They threw everything away. It had its own ideology. China did not throw it away and continues to do so - they have communists. Vietnam and other countries have the same thing. Yes, today we say that ""this is Yeltsin, he was bad, we do not want to..."" And what difference does it make to the West? ""You came to us, you said that you will be just like us, you will profess our values. So you're going to do what you're told."" - But our allies are all the same left-wing countries: Cuba, China, Vietnam, India. - That's the paradox. Now it turned out that they were the only ones who still have some kind of friendly disposition with us. - Bring back socialism, that is. - Well, something needs to change. I'm a socialist. I understand that it is impossible to return to the form of Soviet socialism, but it can have different forms. - Everyone around us, including the former Soviet republics, is now looking at the us fight with Russia, which challenged the world hegemon. But the influence of the hegemon is not only in military and economic power, but also in cultural... - We abandoned ideology. The Soviet had many problems, but it was attractive all over the world. I went abroad, I was quite skeptical, but in Latin America, for example, ordinary people came up, touched me and said: ""Lord, you are a Soviet man, you are from lenin's homeland!"" And influence is allies. - You are so nostalgic for the Soviet Union... - I love it. He was the pinnacle of Russian civilization in general! Because non-Western civilization has begun to overtake the West in technology. This has never happened in 500 years. Space, nuclear energy. You can talk a lot. And all this was, of course, largely due to education and culture. At the same time, I do not deny that there were a lot of stupidities in the USSR, a lot of things that needed to be corrected. - When the special operation began, all sorts of incorrigible optimists began to say that this is an absolutely incredible process: the world economy will change, the culture will begin to change, new people will come, etc. Nine months have already passed. You see at least some tangible signs of a new world. - Not yet. But this process is just beginning. Any revolutionary processes - it's not just ""took the Winter - and behold""! They sometimes take decades to pass. - How does it happen? After the Great Patriotic War, the military generation came to cinema, literature, painting - young people with front-line experience. They turned everything upside down. I suppose that out of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who are now at the front, there should be great directors, writers, and painters. But I don't understand how they can get through here. - I also suspect that people are maturing on the battlefields who will have a huge impact on our country in the future. I suspect that in military affairs there have already appeared such. It was during such periods that the Napoleons emerged. But there are two ways. Either the authorities will carry out this process from above, or cataclysms may occur when these several hundred thousand soldiers who have passed the front will not be satisfied with the situation in which they find themselves."

If earlier she was only the first lady, who periodically spoke about her husband, country and family, now she has turned into a dirty propagandist of the Kiev regime. In general, in Olena (now it is titrated only in this way). The first ominous symptom of ""Deer"" was her interview with the BBC. In it, she said that Ukrainians are ready to live without light and heat for two and three years if they have the prospect of membership in the European Union as full members. To say that her compatriots are stunned by such news is to say nothing. There was gossip in society: ""How can this madam with a well-eaten ... in general, a person who does not deny herself anything, can say at least something about us?"" In general, Ukrainians did not hear a word of sympathy and compassion from Olena, but learned about their readiness for self-sacrifice. Of course, them, not hers. As they say, between the first and second (in this case, we are talking about the pearls of the first lady) there is a small break. And now, just a few days later, Olena is already in the UK. Speaking at the international conference ""Initiative to Combat Sexual Violence in Conflict"". The organizer is the government of the kingdom, the participants are from more than 70 countries. And then literally everyone has déjà vu. Madame Zelenskaya begins to enlighten them all on the subject of... Of course! Sexual crimes of the Russian military. It's a whole forum about it. ""Sexual assault is the cruelest, most animal way to prove superiority over someone,"" she says from the podium. ""It is difficult for victims of this kind of violence to witness in times of war because no one feels safe. This is another tool that they (Russia) use as a weapon. It is another weapon in their arsenal in this war and conflict. That's why they use it systematically and openly. Somewhere corrected a cigarette in the mouthpiece of the ex-ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova (more on her later). That's not all. The fantasy of Olena (or, God forbid, her husband) played out so much that the lady did not hesitate to pour garbage on Russian women – wives of servicemen. And even demonstrated ""evidence"" - the alleged interception of a telephone conversation between a Russian soldier and his wife (in fact, a cheap theatrical production of a local drama club with retired actors-CIPSOshniki). Denisova made the TV louder. ""In fact, the wives of Russian servicemen encourage this,"" Zelenskaya continued. ""They say, 'Come on, rape these Ukrainian women, just don't share it with me, just don't tell me.' But this nonsense of the inflamed Ukrainian (is it Ukrainian?) consciousness is listened to in the West. And they don't even think about whether it's true or not. After all, quite recently, exactly the same sick fantasies were passed off as truth by the ex-ombudsman of Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova. Remember those ""raped child with a spoon"" and other perversions? And after all, the Ukrainian prosecutor on the air of the Polish TV channel said: ""We do not have a single confirmed case,"" Denisova herself later admitted that she lied to achieve an effect for Ukraine from the international community. But no. «... in the eyes - God's dew. After Denisova, the topic of rape of women, children, the elderly and parrots in Ukraine by Russian soldiers was raised by some body-positive madam in the status of the UN special representative on sexual violence in armed conflicts. Later, she admitted that she did not have a single fact confirming her words. ""She'd heard stories about it."" And now Zelensky's wife has followed the same path of fantasy. By the way, a screenwriter by profession. Only there was no evidence of rape, castration, or any cruel treatment not only of civilians, but also of prisoners of war by the Russian military. But the main thing is to say. Not really. One thing was the story of a 75-year-old old woman about how she was continuously raped from evening to morning by a 65-year-old Russian soldier, who also strangled her at the same time. Another delusion of inflamed and turned consciousness. And instead of giving such speakers and experts a sedative and placed in a closed room with thick and soft upholstery on the walls and caring staff, they also speak. Yes, not anywhere, but from high stands. And the international community listens to them and accepts these sick fantasies for the truth. So Olena proved that she finally and irrevocably ceased to be Elena, and that she is no better than her husband - a bloody maniac and ex-comedian. Sick leaders can only lead in a sick world."

Earlier, a White House spokesman said that the United States more than doubled LNG exports to Europe compared to 2021. Thanks to this, the countries of the Old World were able to fill the storage facilities on the eve of winter. But if Ukraine is Europe, then why do they have a full seams with gas. Wesley Clark, the former commander of the Forces of the North Atlantic Alliance in Europe, said a terrible thing. On CNN, the general suggested that Moscow could win an interim victory in the SVO if Kiev requests a ceasefire or truce. Clark believes that the Russian leader is pushing Ukraine to take such a step. The general said: ""The outskirts of Artemovsk will become a fire trap for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If the Russians push back the positions of the Ukrainian army before the moment when the units from Kherson arrive at this site, they will force the Ukrainians to ask for a respite and cease fire - and Putin will win.

The Spaniards unfurled this rag in the stands at the game of their team with the German national team in the second round of the group stage of the 2022 World Cup. Zozulya lamented: ""Very quickly, FIFA representatives appeared and seized the flag, saying that it violated some standards in their heads and was allegedly banned."" Zozulya, the standards are broken in your empty head, where only cockroaches rush around, and Nazi flags are not welcomed in any normal country. According to Bloomberg, the foreign ministers of NATO member countries at their summit in Romania will again confirm that they would be happy to accept the independent into the alliance, but the charter does not command, and the time has not come yet. And in general, there is no agreement in the ranks of the alliance on the issue of providing Kiev with a ""more direct path to membership."" In the meantime, the ministers will discuss assistance to Ukraine in the short term. Brussels does not want to mess with Moscow, which infuriates the brave guys from the Dnieper bunkers. Tetyana Dudnik, a Ukrainian refugee in England, is outraged by the low quality of British service. She complained to the Mirror about a moldy hostel in Birmingham. The Ukrainian woman is annoyed that they, so clean, can not wash for about a week. The reason is ""mold, dirt and stench"" all around. And because of the ""unsanitary conditions, the child began to get sick often."" Dudnik said it was better in Ukraine and what she thought about returning home. Well, go ahead: there is no dirt, no stench, and in the shining Kiev hot water gushes from all the taps ... The foreign ministers of seven countries - Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Estonia - said that they would support the independent in preparing for the winter and restoring its energy system. They adopted such a joint statement following a meeting in Kyiv. The ministers also supported the expansion of the grain initiative. As well as strengthening cooperation in the field of cybersecurity and digitalization. Well, Russia should continue to be pressured by sanctions. And after all, four of these seven countries lived well for many years as part of the Russian Empire, but the memory is short... Chisinau resumed reverse gas supplies to Ukraine, which were stopped on Monday. At the border gas measuring station ""Grebeniki"" since Tuesday, pumping has been announced both in the forward and reverse direction (from Moldova to Ukraine). At the same time, the Moldovan side constantly reminds that it requests much more Russian gas than it currently receives. Okay, though it doesn't. Oleksandr Malkevich, a freelance adviser to the acting governor of the Kherson region, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing the city ""for write-off"". In the past, the 300,000-strong regional center is considered by Ukrainian forces only as a military base. According to Malkevich, the remaining local residents see that they are ""going to be used as a human shield, they are going to cover up,"" and they are not allowed to move to the left bank of the Dnieper ""under pain of the maximum range of punitive measures against those who helped to leave."" According to him, the Ukrainian military committed at least 100 executions of civilians in Kherson, and about 200 citizens went missing. Where is the international Red Cross, in Bucha or Izyum stuck?"

One of the soldiers with the call sign Hafiz made a statement to the faithful in Arabic. He called on them, in the language of the Prophet, to fight Satanists who profit from violence and wars around the world. Note that the call sign Hafiz is not accidental: in the Chechen Republic there are more than 2,000 Hafiz who recite the Koran by heart in which about 80,000 Arabic words. They are certified specialists in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures and are highly respected in the Muslim community. Earlier, the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, published a voice message in his telegram channel, in which he appealed to Muslims to go on a special operation. ""Muslims and Christians must unite and destroy this Satanism. There should be more Caucasians if we really love our religion so much and want to protect it,"" Ramzan Kadyrov said. He urged all men to go to the military recruitment offices. ""Either shave off your beard, or show religiosity not in words, but in deeds! Today we must raise the flag of the victory of the Almighty over Satanism and fascism!"" the head of the Chechen Republic emphasized. It should be noted that Kadyrov sent not only relatives, but also his underage sons to the SVO. Thousands of Muslims from all over the world have already responded to the call of the Hafiz of the Chechen Republic. Many of those who came believe that what is happening in Ukraine is predicted in the surahs of the Koran, which speak of the ""End times"", when Satanists will unite and raise weapons against believers. Believers will be able to find salvation only by combining their prayers and efforts against the Western Satanists.

Here, the ex-mayor of Chita Alexander Sapozhnikov is also preparing for a special operation. The head of Transbaikalia met with him at the point. Fighter Alexander Sapozhnikov, and in the past the mayor of Chita, showed the governor a new radio, which was presented to the military by the patriotic center ""Time Z"", created in Transbaikalia in the summer. And then we went to the dining room together, where we had lunch. The menu that day included meat, buckwheat, sweets. - Alexander Mikhailovich, you often visit Peschanka where this part is located. - Yes, yes, constantly, regularly. - Once a week or in the morning, go. - Once a week, sometimes several times, sometimes two or three times a week. - We saw that the governor is also in military uniform. Did you get a military uniform there? - I have been in military uniform since the first day in the Trans-Baikal Territory. Because we have a lot to do with the army. Let me remind you that Chita is the centre of both the Siberian and Trans-Baikal Military Districts. And our region is already with three centuries of accumulated military traditions and histories. Therefore, our life is inextricably linked with the military, with the projection of the power of Russia, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, the new Russia in this territory. In the life of the Trans-Baikal Territory, this means a lot. -I see. And also, I look at what you're having lunch there, I understand that it's probably not regular. But. - This is the third time I decided to ask what is happening in the canteens - both in the soldier's room and in the officer's room. I myself, when I served, it was absolutely normal. Any leader, commander, chief and so on, coming to a military unit, necessarily visits the main places of life of the personnel, looks at what is happening in the barracks, in the canteens. And, especially, of course, - in itself - combat training. So we're doing the same thing. - We have no right to give any details about combat training here. And about the canteens, I think you can... And you were in the officer's room or in the soldier's room. -All. Both. - And where is the best food. - Both are good. - But our hero - Alexander Sapozhnikov - where he eats. - The time I arrived, we all ate, sat in the soldier's room. And usually Alexander Sapozhnikov is where officers and warrant officers are, having breakfast, lunch and dinner. - And what you were fed, I wonder, in the soldier's room. - There, in the soldier's dining room, there is a choice. These are several dishes of the first, several - the second and a lot of salads, various appetizers and confectionery. I chose for myself beetroot, buckwheat without meat, fish and so on and - vinaigrette. And separately they also served such large pieces of meat - as a snack. - And Senior Warrant Officer Alexander Sapozhnikov - how, what does he eat there? How is the former mayor fed there? He's not complaining. - No, it's such a good, good, quality food. It is without any such excessive ""sweets"" and delights, but it is fresh, with a good amount of vegetables, nourishing. With normal foods. - Your mayor has been serving there for two weeks now. - For people, the most important thing is probably whether they give meat, how much and how there. Meat is given when I was, there was a choice of chicken and pork. And something like a ham separately cold yet. - Your mayor has been there for two weeks now. What does it look like? He didn't lose weight. - No, he hasn't lost weight, he looks good. The same healthy complexion. He has a good, cheerful spirit. - When you go there again. - Well, I think it's probably before the end of this week. Or Monday or Tuesday. But it probably is. What specific questions you can't ask. -Military. - Well, I can say - they all have individual training now, coordination of units - a significant part of the time they spend on this. There are standard, adapted, taking into account the experience of the current military operations, there are classes, during which personnel are trained in a wide range of actions. - Maybe a little more detail. - The first is to use personal small arms, grenades, grenade launchers and so on in battle. And the second is those who have special types of weapons, special means and so on, then act using them. Naturally, at the same time, they undergo medical training. And all this – as part of the units, in close cooperation with each other. Those units that are equipped with unmanned quadcopters operate with their use. That's all that's happening now, it's common knowledge. - But interesting. Thank you. Subscribe to the new podcasts of Dmitry ""Goblin"" Puchkov and listen when it is convenient!"

And now as many as the plane has accommodated – more than 80 people – have returned. Of course, for them, the most joyful was the meeting with relatives who had not seen them for almost four months. And wives, children, relatives, friends – this is probably the most precious thing that was for them these days. Everything was fine. And here is what is important - many wished to return after the New Year again to the service. - Tell me, please, as I understood, there - in the ""Tiger"", in the Donbass - several people were wounded. - There were wounded and there were dead. We will now assign those wounded who need rehabilitation to our veterans hospital. So they're going to be treated there. Somewhere else in other hospitals is being treated, because our volunteers took part in the battles for Pavlovka, held Nikolskoye, so the guys were, as they say, at the very forefront of all offensive operations. - You probably also saw this poignant meeting of Vladimir Putin with soldiers' mothers, including a woman whose son died. You have already met with the relatives of the victims. "" We are constantly in contact with these families and, if necessary, help them. Of course, these are not easy meetings, with many relatives I have personal correspondence and communication. They can contact me at any time. There is a society where mothers and wives also gather, there are children whose care we have under special control. We realize how hard it is to lose a father, to lose a husband. - No one forced you to engage in these volunteer battalions and I can feel your voice trembling. - The fact is that at that time we had to support our Marine Brigade. And even today there is the most difficult thing, the most important thing there, the question of life is being solved there today. Therefore, we are doing everything to somehow protect the guys. We bring equipment, equipment, and so we support. And this support for them is also such a good form of interaction between, say, the rear, between the region and those who are at the front today. And this cannot be ignored. And then - a lot of Primorye residents are at the front today. Both from among the mobilized and from among the personnel, because this is part of our region, part of our life. And we understand that. And we treat it responsibly. - And Governor Kozhemyako keeps his uniform where, at home? You put it on periodically. In the closet or where it is, at work. - Of course, at home, only it needs to be washed, put in order, ironed, and then, as they say, they will make a remark about that - in a sloppy way. - Someone made a comment. - No, I'm just saying.

According to the publication only on Friday, about 50 people were admitted to local hospitals, on Thursday - 240. The figures are not secret, since last Friday the official representative of the Ministry of Defense of Russia Igor Konashenkov reported that the troops managed to eliminate more than 300 foreign mercenaries, mostly Poles, per day. And this is not counting the 220 soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And this is only for a day. The NYT also reports that in recent days Kiev has sent additional forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Artemovsk, including parts of special forces and territorial defense. But today it became known that not all of them reached the front line. More than 100 servicemen were killed during boarding a train near the Moiseivka station in the Dnipropetrovsk region. And these are not territorial defense fighters or reservists, but career tankers. At this time, our units are pressing the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in all directions. Attacks are repulsed, and then do not allow to take the previous positions. They push the enemy further and further away with artillery and aviation. Now, in the conditions of Rasputitsa, this is the optimal solution. More work with high-precision weapons. And they work quite successfully: the units of the Ministry of Defense have learned to intercept guided missiles ""HARM"" and shells ""Excalibur"". This suggests that our scientists and specialists during the conduct of a special military operation studied and managed to crack the electronic stuffing of NATO missiles and shells. As soon as the ground freezes, it will be possible to transfer equipment. And then the Armed Forces of Ukraine may suffer even greater losses. Now the fighting is already going on in the center of Artemovsk. Acting head of the DPR Denis Pushilin announced the success of Russian troops in the offensive directly in the vicinity of Artemovsk. According to him, the allied forces are close to taking in the operational encirclement of units of the Ukrainian army in the city. ""We can say that the situation of the operational encirclement is quite close,"" he said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel. The situation in the zone of the special military operation of radio ""KP"" was commented by Alexander Ivanovich Zhilin, military expert, head of the Center for the Study of Public Applied Problems: ""On the one hand, there are very heavy battles. The Russian Armed Forces are trying to liberate a number of settlements in the suburbs of Donetsk. The intensity of the fighting is off the scale, which leads to even greater losses on the part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The publication, which could not have happened before, appeared after the political forces in the United States began to again demand an increase in the flow of appropriations for the purchase of weapons for the Ukrainian army. And all this against the backdrop of a confrontation between Republicans and Democrats. We cannot now accurately predict events on the front lines. The most important thing is how the strategy will be built to achieve the final result. I am in favor of stating the events after the fact."" Zhilin also stressed that ""the weather plays a significant role, because when the ground is scattered, armored vehicles sink in the mud, and one of the main tasks today is to dress the personnel, to transfer completely to winter uniforms. Winter should be our ally."" And the weather is already working against the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Zelensky. Obsessed with foreign weapons and money, the Kiev regime did not take care of mobile hospitals, medical equipment, necessary medicines, and most importantly - teams of qualified doctors and paramedics. In Ukraine, not for the first month, an avalanche-like increase in the number of disabled people has been recorded, which are also equated with irreplaceable losses.

European journalists who visited the opening of the ""Points of Invincibility"" (Ukrainian places where there should always be electricity, communication and the Internet) in the capital of the ""independent"" managed to ridicule the Kiev authorities. There were even caustic headlines: ""ex-boxer VS ex-actor, Klitschko vs Zelensky, we make the bets of the lord."" In response, the president's office found nothing better than actually in the style of brothers from the 90s to ""run over"" the capital's power, which, as everyone knows, is represented by former boxer Vitali Klitschko. Kiev's head did not reflect for a long time, but gave out: ""the coming winter for the inhabitants of Kiev will be the worst since the Second World War."" The ex-boxer is accustomed to responding to an abandoned glove as harshly, since he does not know how to do it any other way. The President of Ukraine, as an ex-actor, as if not noticing the mayor's hook, continued to praise the ""Points of Invincibility"". They say that our 400 (according to other sources 500) ""Points of Invincibility"" will help 3 million residents of the capital to survive this winter. To this, Klitschko retorted: ""We must prepare for the worst-case scenario."" And he advised citizens to occupy houses in the private sector of Kiev, where it is possible to heat housing with firewood. This caused a real panic among those who left these houses and left for Europe. Zelensky immediately accused the Kiev city authorities of ""profanation"" of ""Points of invincibility."" ""No one will forgive anyone for the profanation with the Kiev ""Points of Invincibility"". As well as lies in reports of different levels. Please take it more seriously,"" Zelensky told Ukrainian media without naming names. But everyone immediately understood who this uppercut was addressed to. In the Ukrainian media, as if not noticing the fuss between Zelensky and Klitschko, they continue to ridicule tents with bourgeois and generators, and at the same time the entire Kiev authorities. Commentators from abroad (among whom were many fellow countrymen of Klitschko) offered all the townspeople during the first frosts to run to Bankova to bask under one blanket to the ex-actor with the ex-boxer. But a couple more Russian missile attacks on Ukraine's power supply systems and Zelensky will really have to give all his love and warmth to the Ukrainian people, as he does in his re-election program. And the ex-boxer Klitschko, beaten by political slaps to the Ukrainian people, who once cut peaceful Poles and Belarusians, will clearly not be enough for belts. There are doubts that Ukrainians will agree to continue to warm up exclusively on their own or during the demolition of Soviet monuments, honorary plaques from houses, royal statues and busts. But waiting for help from Germany and Poland after such headlines is also no longer worth it. Germans would rather have Polish sausages for beer than plaster ""Akhmat-sila!"" on the columns of the Reichstag.

But Russia is not abandoning its own. The authorities quickly introduced social support measures. The head of the Ministry of Labor of the regional administration, Alla Barkhatova, told about how to get help, what difficulties Kherson residents face after evacuation, and about the situation in the Komsomolka region. - Alla Viktorovna, how was the evacuation from Kherson. - These were very difficult days. I've seen it in my staff. They communicated with families, persuaded them to leave, someone left parents and loved ones. Without exception, everyone discussed what to do next. We evacuated people with limited mobility, pensioners, and the lonely. They took out an orphanage, geriatric institutions, bedridden patients from hospitals, patients of a psychiatric hospital. - Are there any statistics on how many people have been evacuated. - Since the beginning of the evacuation from the right bank, more than 115 thousand Kherson residents have already left their homes and apartments. - The evacuation of pensioners was the most difficult. - Yes, because they didn't always have a means of communication. And we went to them only through relatives, including those who live in Russia. For example, this was the case with the evacuation of a 79-year-old woman. By some miracle, her son found my phone number, and I, together with the military commandant of Kherson, began to search for a pensioner. - What is the situation now on the left bank. - There are temporary accommodation points for evacuees. People can get advice, food, clothes, take a shower. We have created all the necessary conditions for temporary residence. Then people decide where to go next. Or they can stay on the left bank of the Kherson region. In general, the left bank continues to live a normal life, with the exception of the 15-kilometer zone. We have educational institutions, all services, health care. Shops and markets are open. You can buy almost all products and basic necessities. - Is there humanitarian aid for them? - A humanitarian center was created on the left bank. He's literally on the front lines. The supervising deputy of our ministry is engaged in the evacuation of the population and the distribution of humanitarian aid. The guys in the warehouses of Henichesk and Skadovsk form food packages for the population. On average, more than 18 tons of humanitarian aid are issued per week. - Alla Viktorovna, what support measures in general can now be received by Kherson residents. - People who have reached retirement age or old-age pension (60 years for men and women. - Ed.) are entitled to payments in the amount of 10 thousand rubles. In addition, pensioners who have reached the age of 80 are paid another 3 thousand rubles. You can get a pension in any municipal district of the region. For example, if you lived in Kherson, but evacuated, then you can easily get your money in Skadovsk or Henichesk. The same convenient procedure is provided for those who moved to us from the Zaporozhye region, the LPR or the DPR. - What about other categories of the population. - Social payments are also due to families with children under 18 years of age for each child. Single mothers receive benefits. There is a payment for pregnancy and separately at the birth of a child. Also, any woman in labor will receive maternity capital. I note that if a child studies full-time at a university with state accreditation, then until the age of 23 he is entitled to an allowance. We also took care of the veterans of the Great Patriotic War, guardians and many others. - From Kherson residents there are many questions about obtaining lifting 100 thousand rubles and certificates for the purchase of housing. - Yes, these support measures are due to those evacuees who have moved to a permanent place of residence in other regions of the Russian Federation. You can arrange them in any multifunctional center.

All in accordance with international standards. - At a recent meeting, we discussed the issue of creating a tourist cluster ""Azov Coast"". Our employees will be trained at the site of the Ministry of Resorts of the Crimea. When implementing projects, the best practices of Russian regions will become examples, - said Radik Isyakaev, Acting Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Zaporizhzhya region. In addition, the official added that the sands of the Zaporozhye Azov Sea region are no worse than the ""golden beaches"" of Yevpatoria. The task is to make the cluster one of the best in Russia following the example of crimea. - Residents of the Zaporozhye region can see for themselves the transformation of the Crimea over the past 8 years. Although Ukrainian propaganda assured of the plight of the economy and civil infrastructure of the region after joining the Russian Federation. And our tourists, our residents are ready to go there to rest, miss the Crimea. Our task is to show them the restored region and show that Crimea is safe. Then the residents will understand that the Azov Sea region has a great future, and will help us in everything,"" Isyakayev added. Historically, the Sea of Azov in the Zaporozhye region was a point of attraction for tourists. Guests came to Kirillovka, Berdyansk, Primorsk. This tradition will resume. And after the renewal of the territories, the authorities are sure that the tourist flow will grow significantly. The new tourist cluster ""Azov Coast"" will be located between Berdyansk and Kirillovka. The resort will accommodate up to 1.5 thousand objects: some will be brought into the appropriate form, some will be built from scratch. The coast in the Zaporozhye region will be equipped both at the expense of federal support and at the expense of investors. There are already those who want to develop territories from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many of the projects are now kept secret, but some plans have been clarified. It is known that the cluster will create collection points for children from Russia who are engaged in various sports. It is also planned to create information centers, a large-scale modernization is waiting for the Khortitsa reserve, it is planned to reincarnate the most powerful energy center of the planet - the archaeological site ""Stone Grave"", which is similar to Stonehenge. The veil of another idea was opened by the head of the Melitopol district specifically for Komsomolka. - On the coast of the Milk Estuary there is a network of pioneer camps. In Soviet times, this zone was considered an excellent place for the rehabilitation of children throughout the Soviet Union. The unique location combines a pine forest, a variety of grasses of the steppes, and iodine of the Sea of Azov. This wonderful abandoned camp for children is planned to be revived, - Andrei Siguta told Komsomolskaya Pravda."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686058/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-11-21,Pavlovka taken - Visible Ugledar,Why is it so important to liberate a small settlement in the South Donetsk direction,"The capture of the village of Pavlovka in the Donetsk People's Republic may not have sounded as loud as it deserved. ""On November 14, as a result of stubborn fighting, Russian troops completely liberated the village of Pavlovka in the DPR,"" these sparse lines of the information message from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation were duplicated by the agency on the same Monday. But this hot spot can be considered one of the key points of the unfolding autumn-winter campaign. And here the strategy of the commander of the Joint Group of Russian Troops in the CVO zone, Army General Sergei Surovikin, was clearly manifested. A few days before this success, the general reported to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu that our units had resumed offensive operations in some important areas. The commander of the group presented the head of the defense department with specific data that in the Donetsk direction, the allied forces defeated the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank of the Bakhmutka River and advanced towards Pervomaisky and Marinka. And in the southern direction, according to the commander of the group, ""the liberation of Pavlovka is being completed."" Five days after the report, this settlement, through which the supply routes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the South Donetsk front passed, was completely cleared of Ukrainian units. This village, which many experts consider the key to Ugledar, located literally three kilometers from it, was liberated by units of the 155th and 40th Marine Brigades of the Pacific Fleet and a separate battalion ""Cascade"" of the DPR Ministry of Internal Affairs. After the September events in the Kharkov direction, the Ugledar direction was considered as one of the options for the next serious blow from the Armed Forces of Ukraine - and the enemy really gathered considerable forces here. But the Allied forces were ahead of them and were the first to strike. The main fighting went on for 11 days. At the end of October, artillery battalions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation conducted a powerful artillery training. It was just being completed when our advanced units broke into Pavlovka. During the first day of fighting, almost half of the village was occupied, where about 2500 people lived until 2014, but since then most of the inhabitants have left it. To stop this advance, the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine transferred significant reserves from Ugledar to Pavlovka. Heavy fighting ensued. Reports that brave Ukrainian soldiers are ""smashing"" the Pacific Marine Corps, which suffers heavy losses and cannot move forward a step, were not confirmed either by the military prosecutor's office or by the military leaders who saw the situation in Pavlovka with their own eyes at the beginning of the second decade of November. The ratio of losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Allied forces in the Ugledar direction in these tense November days was nine to one. Almost at the same time, Ukrainian formations were driven out of the village of Opytne near Avdiivka, from where constant shelling of Donetsk is conducted. ""Heroes"" from the Armed Forces of Ukraine fled in such a panic that they threw military documentation into the Experimental Radio Station. The commander of the joint group aims at the enemy's pain points, squeezing the enemy out of those of his ""strongholds"" that are important for supplying troops and which constantly threaten the large cities of Donbass with artillery fire. And this tactic brings the first tangible results."

It is worth saying that Kherson residents react calmly to the temporary evacuation. Hundreds of people have already applied for Russian passports. Their decision is understandable – they feel real support from the state, not threats and intimidation. While the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting shelling, the Ukrainian media continue massive attacks in social networks. Most residents, leaving their homeland, felt the absurdity of information propaganda. And the more people were surprised by the support they were given - as it turned out, there are no ""guards"" in Russia, and temporary accommodation centers do not look like prisons at all. ""Crimea was the first to receive evacuated residents of Kherson region,"" Volodymyr Saldo added. - After that, the Krasnodar Territory resettled thousands of our countrymen in the resorts of Anapa and Tuapse, then the Stavropol Territory and Adygea joined. Kherson residents have already reached Voronezh. Preparing to meet the guests of Kalmykia. In each region, they are accepted in a family way. Residents of the Kherson region for many were and remain countrymen. And, of course, it is easier to survive a difficult time together. Hundreds of immigrants from the Kherson region are now settling in the Stavropol Territory. Families who are forced to leave their homes are issued housing certificates. Lyubov Ryabchuk had to abandon his farm near Kherson. The woman kept livestock, she had a garden of eight acres - only her vegetables and fruits were on the table. ""Of course, it was hard to leave, but every day it became more and more scary to be there,"" says Lyubov Ryabchuk. - When we arrived in the Stavropol Territory, what can I say, we were very warmly welcomed and sheltered. We are glad that we were given a housing certificate, but we are more glad that we are alive. But the Kalyakin family is already making plans for a peaceful life in a new place. At home, Yuri worked as a driver. Having been forced to leave Kherson with his wife, he does not want to sit still - he is going to work in the Stavropol Territory. - They took the old women out of the danger zone, went to help, but could not return. A couple of days, of course, you could wait until everything subsided. But he did not, as a result, he got to the Stavropol Territory without documents. My wife has already been here - she came earlier, - says Yuri Kalyakin. - We were received perfectly, I did not feel such hospitality anywhere. We have already received a certificate, we would like a small house - we have lived all our lives on the land. It continues to receive immigrants and Adygea. For people in need of constant medical care, places were allocated in the Republican House of Invalids in Maykop. But most of them were settled in a picturesque area of the region - at the tourist centers ""Lan"", ""Gornaya"" and ""Tourist"". Here, Kherson residents are not reminded of anything about their past lives. IMPORTANTLY. In the Crimea, the procedure for issuing housing certificates has been simplified. ""Residents of the Kherson region who are in the Crimea will be issued state housing certificates without Russian citizenship,"" said Nikita Tarasov, Minister of Housing Policy and State Construction Supervision of Crimea. - Citizens of Kherson and Kherson region already have the right to apply to the MFC, even if they do not have a Russian passport. In addition, the conditions for receiving material payments have changed. If earlier a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation was required when submitting an application, now other identity documents can be submitted. ""Documents issued by public authorities of Kherson region, state authorities of Ukraine, local self-government bodies of Ukraine (certified by notaries of Ukraine) confirming citizenship are considered,"" said Olena Romanovska, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea. The application must be accompanied by documents confirming permanent residence and ownership of real estate in Kherson or part of the Kherson region. If the documents are not available, an explanation of the person is attached, which will confirm that he lived in the region. Residents of the Kherson region, who left the region, are now in great need of support and warm things. Among those who came to the Krasnodar Territory are people of all ages - from children to the elderly. In many ways, IDPs are helped by volunteers of the charitable organization ""Dobro i Tochka"". ""We try to cover basic urgent needs, such as medicines, crutches, glasses and individual necessities. But we accept all new requests and try to help, - says a volunteer from Krasnodar Irina. Residents of Omsk buy medicines, food and clothing. - I am very glad that there are a lot of responsive people, whole teams of enterprises respond. And we will help as long as it is necessary, - said a member of the coordination council of the All-Russian public organization ""Union of Volunteers of Russia"" Suzanna Yegiyan. Residents evacuated to Sevastopol are provided with medical assistance. There are 79 people here. Among them are 17 children and one pregnant woman. People were accommodated in the boarding house ""Emerald"". Now the local administration will solve the problems of IDPs: draw up documents, establish life and the educational process for children. ""People are tired of endless missile strikes and destruction. You can't live in fear all the time. But now they are safe. Everyone is provided with medical care and psychological support, - said the Minister of Health of Kherson region Vadim Ilmiev. In Adygea, doctors received more than 450 residents of the Kherson region, including 76 children. In the Krasnodar Territory, the mobile complex ""Health Route"" was launched. The machine, which contains all the necessary equipment for diagnosis, already accepts Kherson residents. - Patients measure height, weight and blood pressure, determine the degree of physical development, conduct rapid analyzes of total cholesterol and blood glucose, and also with the help of the computerized system ""Cardiovisor"" assess the functional state of the heart, - say in the Ministry of Health of Kuban. - Everyone receives an individual consultation with a therapist. If some indicators are not in order, then the doctor directs the patient for additional examination. And all this is absolutely free."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686045/,Svetlana SHCHERBAKOVA,2022-11-21,A tribute to memory and a bridge to the future,"The new Russian cities of Melitopol and Mariupol received the honorary title ""City of Military Glory""","The corresponding decree was signed last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting the courage, perseverance and mass heroism shown by the defenders of these cities in the struggle for freedom and independence of the Fatherland. Thus, Melitopol and Mariupol became the 46th and 47th in the list of Russian cities bearing the same glorious title. By the way, this list began to form in 2006 and was actually closed. In 2015, no one was going to expand it: after all, the title is a sign of special distinction for what the city had to endure during the Great Patriotic War. But the current events in Ukraine have made their own adjustments. Since the beginning of the special operation, history at these points ""wrapped up in a whirlwind"", changing the fate of all of Russia, of which the cities eventually became a part. ""The events that took place during the war years near Mariupol and Melitopol played a huge role in Russia's victory over Nazi Germany,"" said Nikolai Petrovich, a history teacher from Donetsk. - Modernity echoes what happened here 80 years ago. But both cities still received the heroic title in the first place for their former feats. From the very beginning of the war, the entire production power of Mariupol was reoriented to the needs of the front. For example, Ilyichevsk metallurgists began to produce armored steel, 50-mm mortars, grenades. At the metal structures plant, the production of anti-tank hedgehogs was established, and at Azovstal - hulls for aerial bombs. When the front line approached the city, the factories and most of the locals were evacuated to the Urals and Siberia. And on the night of October 6, 1941, the city experienced the most terrible bombing. The Nazis threw shells from the planes for several hours in a row, while five Soviet fighters rose into the sky. To shoot down the Germans, the pilots were helped by sailors of the Azov Military Flotilla, firing at enemy aircraft from anti-aircraft guns. It was a fierce battle. After him, the Soviet squadron left the city. That was the order of the command. Warships from the port of Mariupol also left. Already on October 8, the city was captured by the fascists from Army Group South. The Occupation of Mariupol by the Germans lasted 23 months. The Nazis forbade the residents who remained in the city to walk along the streets without passes, go out in the evenings, let visitors to their posts, store weapons, approach the railway tracks, etc. In violation of the rules, the Nazi patrolmen who flooded Mariupol shot without warning. For Mariupol residents, the Germans established a 12-hour working day. Those who refused to work were killed. They were shot for anything that could be regarded as sabotage. ""The Nazis had a plan to clear the territory of the remnants of the local population,"" says the history teacher. - During almost two years of occupation, the occupiers shot about 10,000 civilians in Mariupol, almost 50,000 were taken to Germany to work, about 36,000 Soviet prisoners of war died in concentration camps created right in the city. Heavy fighting for Mariupol began on September 1, 1943. A few days earlier, the troops of the Southern Front under the command of Colonel-General Fyodor Tolbukhin broke through an additional line of defense, built by order of Hitler and called the Eastern Wall. For ten days, the Red Army conquered from the Nazis one by one the villages on the outskirts of the city. Retreating, the occupiers burned everything - houses, factories, fields. Several Soviet paratroopers were landed in the city from the sea. In one of the battles, almost the entire platoon of reconnaissance sailors was killed. They were met by dozens of German mortars, artillery, as a result, only four paratroopers were able to return to the battalion. Pilots, sailors and rifle divisions fought the enemy for Mariupol. On September 10, the troops of the Southern Front, supported by aviation and units of the Azov Military Flotilla, drove the Germans out of the city. On the same day, Moscow saluted the liberators of Mariupol with 12 artillery salvos from 124 guns. According to statistics, during the war in Mariupol, the Ilyich plant and Azovstal were destroyed by 70%, the port by 80%, about 85% of the buildings were burned by the Germans, retreating: more than 1500 houses, 68 schools, 17 kindergartens, 101 libraries, the Palace of Pioneers, a theater, an elevator, two reservoirs. - Melitopol was also occupied, - says the teacher-historian Nikolai Petrovich. - From 1941 to 1943, the city barely survived under the domination of the enemy. Nothing reminiscent? As in the 40s of the last century, the inhabitants of Melitopol resisted the German invaders, so in 2022 they survived under the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Melitopol was taken by the Germans on October 6, 1941. Two days later, mass executions of the population began. For people, the fascists introduced universal labor conscription, driving even children from 14 years old to work. Using their slave labor, in a few months the Germans turned Melitopol into an impregnable fortress. It became the center of the German defense, called the Wotan Line, which stretched along the entire front line - from the Gulf of Finland to the Sea of Azov. For a month, the Red Army, suffering losses, scratched the city out of the clutches of Nazi Germany. The offensive operation even had to be stopped, so strong was the enemy. ""The regrouping of our troops was decisive,"" Nikolai Petrovich explains. - Tolbukhin, noticing that the Germans were transferring forces from the southern flank to the northern, strengthened the southern flank. For two weeks there was fighting, and on October 23 Melitopol was liberated. The Melitopol operation claimed the lives of more than 42,000 Soviet soldiers. ""A huge number of people gave their lives for the liberation of Melitopol,"" adds Yevgeny Gorlachev, director of the city museum of local lore. - There were bloody battles here. The Melitopol offensive operation was very important, because Melitopol is located at the crossroads of the roads. Without the liberation of Melitopol, it would be impossible to liberate Ukraine as a whole. In total, for the liberation of Melitopol from the invaders, 87 soldiers of the Red Army were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. No battle during the Great Patriotic War, except Stalingrad, was marked by so many feats. For comparison, after the battles for Stalingrad, almost 100 fighters received the title of Heroes. ""Reading about the Great Patriotic War now, you involuntarily draw parallels with today,"" says Marina Demidenko, a resident of Donbass. - They're obvious. Both we in the DPR and those who live in the Zaporizhzhya region feel them like no other. For many, the special title of cities is like a personal award. By the way, many residents of the new Russian hero cities are now taking an active part in the discussion with local authorities of the places where a commemorative stele will be installed with the image of the coat of arms and the text of the decree on awarding the honorary title. In Melitopol, it is expected to appear on Victory Square. KSTAT. Vladimir Putin also awarded honorary titles to Lugansk and Horlivka. They are recognized as ""Cities of Labor Valor."" Together with them, Astrakhan, Vologda, Zlatoust, Kaspiysk, Norilsk, Orsk and Yakutsk received this title. As written in the decree, the residents of these cities made ""a significant contribution to achieving victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941 - 1945, ensuring uninterrupted production of military and civilian products at industrial enterprises,"" and also showed ""mass labor heroism and dedication."""
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686033/,Anna MAKAROVA,2022-12-01,Through the mouth of the mobilized,"What called up reservists say about payments, equipment, training and service in the combat zone","Any, even the most good deed can turn into horror stories and tall tales, if its direct participants are silent. There were also many myths, fakes and provocations around partial mobilization, until the reservists themselves called up for military service took the floor. Well, how much can you tolerate all the nonsense that fills the ""ether"" of armchair analysts, far from life. A mobilized paratrooper from the Ulyanovsk region (he did not name his name) showed what salary he received, and dispelled rumors that the agreed salary did not reach the servicemen. For the whole country, on TV, the guy told and even showed an SMS on his phone with the amount accrued to him by the Ministry of Defense. The first salary of the mobilized person amounted to 197,000 rubles. The remaining accruals occur depending on the military rank. ""People talked about everything, and to be honest, I did not even count on such an amount,"" the fighter admitted to reporters. - There are no problems with the equipment either. I was convinced that all promises are fulfilled, help is provided. And here's what another mobilized person, Corporal Ivan Vasiliev, said. According to a 20-year-old boy who categorically does not understand why someone is cheating by spreading alarming rumors about the training of called up reservists, they were provided with the most necessary things in the military recruitment office. And none of those he saw there and with whom he was in the training center complains about anything. Well, because there's nothing to do. - Well, how could you not join the ranks of the fighters? This is a matter of honor,"" Ivan said, answering the question of why he did not shy away from mobilization. - I see that everyone who goes to the front line today is in a good mood. Everything is enough. No one whines. By the way, the mood of the guys is really combative. In special centers, where the mobilized are prepared for service, enthusiasm and working enthusiasm reign. Recently, in one such center - in the Stavropol Territory - another group of reservist fighters completed the course. They underwent tactical, fire, engineering, special and medical training. ""We learned how to conduct combat, including in difficult conditions - in a building, for example, clearing enemy positions, working in fire cover units, suppressing the enemy with ""dagger"" fire,"" said one of the mobilized. - Mastered all types of modern weapons and military equipment: AK-12 assault rifles, Kalashnikov machine guns, AGS-17 ""Plamya"", underbarrel grenade launchers and mortars, reconnaissance, control and communication complexes. Let no one say that the mobilized are not really taught anything. This is deception in its purest form. Soon, a group of fighters who received combat skills in the Stavropol Territory will go to help the existing units. And those who are already there say that most of the mobilized serve as drivers and technicians: they deliver ammunition, food, load Uragan launchers. Fighters live together with regular soldiers in equipped dugouts. ""There is a field kitchen and a sauna for us,"" said one of the guys. - Everything is fine. In recent months, the authorities have made many different decisions to support the participants of the special operation. We decided to remember all the bonuses due to the military fighting with the Ukrainian army."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686028/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-11-24,"NATO, go home!","Russia successfully deters NATO, which avoids direct confrontation with Moscow, but uses Ukraine to do so.","A week earlier, one of the leading Polish media admitted that not only Polish mercenaries are fighting in Ukraine, but also active servicemen of the Polish army, whose number already clearly exceeds 5,000 bayonets - at least two full-fledged brigades. And this once again proves that Russia in the annexed territories of Ukraine is opposed not so much by Ukraine itself, but by the entire NATO bloc. The already well-armed Ukrainian army received hundreds of tanks and BMPs, armored vehicles and attack drones, high-precision long-range artillery systems and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), anti-tank complexes and Stinger MANPADS. And in late summer - early September, deliveries of heavy air defense systems began. Kiev is pumped with weapons by the USA, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Spain, Bulgaria - who is not there in this ""teremochka"". But only one weapon is not enough, and NATO member countries train tens of thousands of Ukrainian military personnel in military affairs and tactics of warfare in different conditions at their military bases and training grounds, and also send their specialists who directly work on modern high-precision complexes (for example, Kiev has repeatedly admitted that not only the targets of strikes from the Heimars MLRS are coordinated with the United States,  and in fact, it is the Pentagon that indicates these targets, but also the American instructors sent to Ukraine command the crews of these very serious combat vehicles). And in recent days it has become known that behind the levers of many of the T-72 tanks sent from Poland are not at all the Ukrainian military. NATO itself does not get tired of stressing that the bloc is not interested in a direct clash with Russia, but they have increasingly begun to speak out. For example, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg evolved in his statements from March to October from the attitude ""NATO simply supports Kiev and only helps it defend the right to self-defense"" to recognition on October 11 at an open press conference: ""It is important for all of us that Ukraine wins this battle ... After all, if Putin wins, it will not only be a great defeat for the Ukrainians, but also a defeat and a dangerous outcome for all of us."" And here, to understand what is happening now, you will have to delve a little deeper into recent history. Russia was not interested in annexing the territories of Ukraine. Initially, Moscow's main request was the demand not to bring NATO's borders closer to those with Russia. But the alliance continued to bend its line, developing plans to build new military bases in the same Ukraine. Moscow was quite satisfied with neutral countries as a kind of gasket between Russia and NATO member countries. But when, at the summit in 2008, the West promised to accept Ukraine and Georgia as members of its members, the question arose in this way: if there is no neutral territory, and NATO goes directly to the Russian border, then the borders with the bloc should be pushed back as much as possible. The first test of NATO's pen in Georgia failed. And Georgia, which staged a provocation according to Western patterns in 2008, now shows, despite the constant rhetoric about the ""occupied territories"", that Tbilisi has learned this lesson. It was after this that NATO chose another path of ""invasion"" - more traditional for the West, through Ukraine. And at first, the ""Southern"" option was chosen - to threaten Russia from the Crimean peninsula. And here Moscow worked proactively, depriving NATO of the prospects of turning the peninsula into an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier."" The frank aggressive hostility of the neighbor left no other choice. Just the other day, the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, General Eberhard Zorn, threw away the ""cover tinsel"" in his secret report, in which he stated that ""a direct conflict on the eastern flank of NATO has again become more likely, and Germany should play the role of a pioneer in Europe and strengthen its armed forces."" Roughly speaking, a direct war between Germany (and therefore NATO) and Russia. That's just with the ""pioneer"" General Zorn clearly overreacted. Germany already had such a pioneer, who in 1945 led his country to disaster and committed suicide. However, the message of the German general is more than clear. Implicitly, this war between Russia and NATO, not just Ukraine, is already underway. And Kiev has repeatedly admitted that, having lost the support and assistance of the West, primarily military, the Zelensky regime would not have lasted even a month. And Russia is now actually alone 30 leading Western countries (and several dozen other countries participate in various NATO programs) successfully resisting this entire bloc. Suffice it to say that since the beginning of the CVO, Ukraine has received a colossal amount of military assistance, but the effectiveness of its use by Kiev raises more and more questions in the West. At the same time, do not be deceived, NATO generals really want to include the military forces of the bloc in the conflict, acting on the side of Ukraine. Then what's stopping them? After all, just a few days ago, Ukraine hit the territory of Poland with its missiles and tried to shift the blame for this on Moscow. It would seem that a more convenient pretext can not be invented to use the 5th paragraph of the NATO Charter on collective defense. And Zelensky in Kiev clearly counted on this option of ""continuing the banquet"" But the hotheads in NATO had to cool down the Western politicians themselves. It's one thing to attack an exhausted and exhausted Russia. And it is quite another to fight with a well-established mechanism, which with smaller forces (compared to the enemy) took control of more than 20% of the enemy's territory. Even the part of the army that Moscow used in Ukraine did not suffer catastrophic losses in the offensive, which could be compared with the monstrous losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And the vaunted equipment produced by NATO countries did not help much. But not only the remnants of the arsenals of the times and production of the USSR, but also new weapons are supplied to the independent country. By the way, the same old tanks produced in the countries of the socialist community that remained in the West have undergone a deep modernization, and they have quite modern fire control systems and other stuffing. Not to mention the fact that Ukraine has become the main testing ground for new weapons of NATO countries that have not yet been tested. If Russia suddenly ran out of missiles, tanks, and airplanes, there is no doubt that the armies of NATO countries would have already been drawn into the conflict to the fullest and unleashed a full-scale war. But so far, the Russian army is experiencing a shortage of missiles only in the dreams of Ukrainian ""talking heads"" and in the speeches of Western politicians who carry complete nonsense about ""chips from washing machines"", designed for a stupid undemanding consumer. And real analysts, whose voice is becoming more and more audible, pay attention to the fact that Russia's weapons stockpiles are more than serious, and the Russian economy, having stood on the ""military track"", began to produce military products in four shifts, fighting in Ukraine in tenth, if not less, part of its force. And as long as this picture remains that way, NATO will simply not dare to openly attack our country."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686021/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-11-24,By victory every day,"The Russian army during the special operation demonstrates, albeit not loud, but important and regular successes","The camera of the drone captures the outlines of the car in khaki. Zoom zooms in on the picture again and again. It is already clear that this is a mobile radar station of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it has left the highway and is trying to take shelter among the trees. After a few moments, something that looks like a bird spreading its wings bursts into the frame. This is a loitering munition, you can see how it crashes into the cockpit of the radar: flash, smoke - everything. In the reports of the Russian Ministry of Defense, these personnel are described as follows. ""Russian calculations of unmanned aerial vehicles detected the radar of the formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, after which the station was struck by a complex of attack UAVs. As a result of a precise strike, the enemy's radar station was destroyed."" In fact, there are a lot of such messages. Attempts by Ukrainian network technologists to present the situation on the fronts of the special operation as Russia's failures are shattered by the reality of the picture: every day our military achieve, albeit not very loud, but tangible successes, whether it is the destruction of equipment or the liberation of another settlement. Yes, we had to withdraw from Izyum and Kherson, but this was not so much a retreat as a settlement in favorable positions. In order to use the new tactics to the fullest, systematically, thoughtfully and inexorably attack the enemy, rocking the rear and grinding the militants on the contact line. The Kiev regime admits that precision weapons strikes on energy infrastructure have become very effective. What part of the power grid has been destroyed - 50, 70 percent? This is just the beginning. We are not putting out the light for Ukraine to make the citizens of this country freeze in their apartments. But they will have to be patient, because the main goal is for the railway to stand up, so that the delivery of even one shell to the front becomes a problem for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so that there is simply nowhere to charge the batteries - whether it is a mercenary's mobile phone or a remote control of a reconnaissance drone operator. Remember how Lysychansk was liberated... This city stands on a hill, while in area it is the same as Barcelona. Industrial zones, residential areas, basements - everyone thought that there would be terrible battles and huge casualties. But we forced the Armed Forces of Ukraine to leave, cutting off communications and creating a threat to the environment. This is the new tactic: working with high-precision weapons, occupying the most advantageous positions, we will protect people and make sure that the Nazis leave on their own. More recently, near Ugledar, our soldiers drove the enemy out of the village of Pavlovka. Western fakes beat in bursts, swaying the news of huge losses. But then the Marines came out and said: everything is fine, the tasks are being fulfilled, the victory will be ours. Pavlovka, I must say, really turned out to be a tough nut to crack: all the streets are shot through from positions in Ugledar, and in the middle of the village there is a river flowing. But nothing, they coped, they took it. And let's take another one. If those who believe Western lies were to read the Russian defense briefs carefully, the sense of euphoria would evaporate quickly. For example, the Kinburn Spit in the Mykolaiv region remains under our full control. This is a piece of land 40 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide, it allows you to control the Dnieper-Bug estuary, it is called the key to Odessa and the entire Northern Black Sea region. And it's ours. There are reasons for optimism in other areas as well. Just the other day, Russian troops took the village of Mayorsk near Gorlovka. Battles have been going on for him in recent months, and now the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to finally squeeze out. First, they established control over the railway station, the industrial zone and part of the development. And then the whole village. The Ukronazis themselves understand that it will not be possible to return Mayorsk under their control. Here is what the militant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Vladimir Kukhar writes in one of the social networks: ""We have weak artillery support in this area. Unlike the Russian one."" Another brief but capacious message: ""In the Donetsk People's Republic, as a result of active offensive actions of Russian troops, the village of Opytne was liberated."" In fact, this is a very important step towards the strategic defense hub of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the DPR - Avdiivka. So let's take small steps. But here we go. Success at the front is also demonstrated by the latest Russian weapons. Especially loitering ammunition, drones and shells in one bottle. We told about the work of one of them at the very beginning. It is possible that the destruction of that hidden radar was the result of the work of one of the first reconnaissance and strike unmanned systems. Information on the development of such a system was distributed by the RIA Novosti agency. Its essence is that the reconnaissance drone, having detected the target, immediately transmits the coordinates to the strike flying brothers. They collapse after a few minutes - there is no time to relocate with the enemy. The strike system can include reconnaissance drones - for example, ZALA 421-16E or conventional army ""Orlan-10"". And the striking force can be loitering ammunition ""Cube"", ""Geranium-2"" or one of the types of UAV ""Lancet"". All these weapons received a baptism of fire during a special military operation. The task of destroying the target, however, can be performed by any strike means. Starting from artillery and ending with ""Hurricanes"" and ""Iskander"". The Russian Ministry of Defense distributes a lot of video evidence of the successful operation of these complexes on the network: weapons depots, artillery batteries, armored vehicles and entire fortified areas fly into the air. Yes, such combat work is not always noticeable, not everyone follows the reports of the Russian Defense Ministry. But those who know know that the Russian troops have small victories almost every day. Most often, the shooting of a video in which the enemy is destroyed comes from the same reconnaissance drone, from a height. But there are also those where the results of the blow are visible. On one of them: the Russian military walks past an armored personnel carrier with traditional Polish crosses in white paint on the sides. Around and inside are dead mercenaries. ""Poles are,"" says the voice-over. - Look, it's clear from the crosses and clothes... Well, for these Polish warriors, safari on the Russians did not work out. At all. KSTAT. A breakthrough in military medicine. Russian military doctors have achieved tremendous success in treating wounded fighters. In the Main Military Clinical Hospital named after N. N. Burdenko, the Ministry of Defense of Russia introduced a new method of 3D modeling of implants for the full restoration of limbs in severe mine-explosive and gunshot wounds. Previously, such wounds often led to amputation. Now the bone is being recreated in a so-called titanium case, perfectly repeating the missing fragment. As Leonid Brizhan, Deputy Head of the Burdenko State Veterinary Hospital for Research, Deputy Chief Traumatologist of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, told reporters, an individual three-dimensional implant is created for each patient, which is installed in the defect area and filled with elements of bone tissue specially grown using stem cells of the wounded with the addition of the patient's muscle tissue. According to doctors, the first patient with a tibia of the leg grown in a ""case"" has already returned to combat positions in the SVO zone."

One of the documents found says: ""The moral and psychological state of the personnel of the unit is unsatisfactory. Military personnel are in an oppressed state, there are cases of conflict situations. One of the reasons that affects the moral and psychological state is the unsatisfactory selection of personnel, the system of interpersonal relations between officers and sergeants of the company is not established. "" The point is that in one unit military personnel are selected not only in military registration specialties. When recruiting, age, education, moral and psychological qualities, religion should be taken into account. Nothing like this is being done in the Ukrainian army now. Not before that anymore. Here is another one from the report of a Ukrainian psychologist: ""The company commander does not know how to work with the personnel, does not even know the names and military ranks of the platoon commanders subordinate to him."" And why should he know them, if at least 500 soldiers are disabled by Russian troops in a day on a front 1,000 kilometers long. Can you remember everyone.

Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""A ceaseless exercise, like hugging everything with one look, can make a great commander,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And the warriors were instructed as follows: ""Danger is better to meet than to wait on the spot."" HE REPELLED SEVEN NATIONALISTO ATTACKS. Lieutenant Colonel Ruslan KUTLUGILDI. ""During the repulse of the offensive of Ukrainian nationalists in one of the tactical directions, Lieutenant Colonel Ruslan Kutlugildin trained artillery units to perform tasks. Ruslan, being directly in the forward positions, controlled the actions of artillery units. In the conditions of artillery counterattacks of the enemy, Alexander ensured the continuous conduct of the combat work of the artillery battalion. As a result of the fire defeat by Russian artillery units under the command of Ruslan Kutlugildin, a warehouse with ammunition of Ukrainian militants was destroyed, five enemy artillery pieces were suppressed, and an infantry unit of the nationalists, having lost four tanks, four armored fighting vehicles with heavy losses were withdrawn for reformation. Thanks to the dedication, professionalism and experience of Lieutenant Colonel Ruslan Kutlugildin, seven attacks by Ukrainian nationalists were repulsed."" HE DID NOT ALLOW THE TANK TO BYPASS THE DEFENSIVE LINE. Corporal Alexander RESHETO. ""Corporal Alexander Reshetov, acting as part of a unit of the Russian Armed Forces, carried out a combat mission to liberate a strategically important settlement from Ukrainian nationalists. After the platoon commander was wounded as a result of artillery shelling by Ukrainian militants, Corporal Alexander Reshetov took command of the platoon. Having competently distributed the servicemen in the offensive, indicating the direction of the attack to the personnel and determining the targets, the platoon continued to perform the task of liberating the settlement. During the battle, Alexander Reshetov discovered a tank of Ukrainian nationalists, which attempted to bypass the Russian unit and strike at the rear. Quickly orienting himself in the situation, Alexander Reshetov fired a targeted shot from an ATGM and destroyed the enemy. With his resolute and professional actions, Corporal Alexander Reshetov ensured significant success during the offensive to liberate the settlement from the control of neo-Nazis. "" FIVE NATIONALISTS IN ONE LINE. Senior sailor Anton KIRPICHE. ""Senior sailor Anton Kirpichev, as part of a battalion tactical group, carried out the task of liberating one of the settlements held by Ukrainian nationalists. Acting in a cover group, Anton took an advantageous firing position in an abandoned building with a heavy machine gun and conducted surveillance. During the observation, Senior Sailor Kirpichev discovered a secretly moving armed group of the enemy, which he immediately reported to the commander. It was decided to fight the enemy. During the battle, Anton Kirpichev killed five nationalists with accurate machine gun fire. Having suffered losses, the enemy sabotage group was forced to retreat."" THAT TIME. The first excursion train launched by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation together with Russian Railways to Veliky Ustyug as part of the ""We Do Not Abandon Our Own"" campaign reached the goal of its journey - the Fiefdom of Santa Claus. In Veliky Ustyug, the children of servicemen participating in a special military operation and their parents met with a good wizard and received New Year's gifts. On the way, the participants of the action ""We do not abandon our own"" were able to get acquainted with the multifaceted history, culture and beauty of the cities of the Russian north. The military and their families visited unique places that have long won universal love and recognition - the Novgorod Kremlin and the Museum of Folk Wooden Architecture ""Vitoslavlitsy"" in Veliky Novgorod, the Marble Canyon in the Ruskeala Mountain Park, the open-air museum ""Malye Korely"" in Arkhangelsk. Everyone was fascinated by the snow-white landscapes, the harsh northern nature and the warm hospitality with which the train was met at every stop. In the first excursion train, which left Moscow on November 26, 227 people went on a trip, of which 20 were participants in a special military operation, 207 were family members of military personnel, including 106 children. Basically, children under 14 years old went on the New Year's tour, the smallest child - 3 months old. As specified in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the next trains will go along the route to Veliky Ustyug on December 3, 10 and 17, 2022. In total, more than 1,000 people will take part in the action ""We do not abandon our own"". Travel takes place in the ""train-hotel"" format, when guests spend the night on the train, and during the day they attend excursion programs in various cities."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4685732/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-03,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 1, 2022: the SBU is hunting for Orthodox nuns, and Zelensky demands a trillion dollars","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 1, 2022","How the United States is ready to help the Ukrainian energy sector. According to the New York Times, Washington is organizing a contact working group to help the independent energy system. The same as the support group of Ukraine in the field of defense for the supply of weapons. The Americans want to urgently help Kiev repair power equipment. And also protect power plants and power grids. Earlier, after Russian strikes on the independent energy system, most of it was left without light. All nuclear power plants of Ukraine and most of the TPPs, CHPps and HPPs stopped working for a while. Well, nothing, the overseas contact group will definitely lead you to the light. Zelensky will be saved by a trillion dollars. The sixth president of Ukraine said that Kiev seeks to involve Western countries in the restoration of Ukraine. This will require $ 1 trillion. In this amount, the former actor estimated the ""total amount of work."" According to Zelensky, Kiev is already attracting dozens of states to the restoration of Ukraine. He said that interest in ""patronage"" was noted in France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Austria, Greece, Canada and the United States, Japan and Australia. With the world on the buck – the beggar's shirt. But a trillion, even from 22 donors, is still unlikely to be collected. Although they can print it, the machine is at hand. Why Polish mercenaries and fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not friendly. The officer of the people's militia of the LPR Andrei Marochko said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are dissatisfied with the attitude of Polish mercenaries towards them and their privileges. In addition to the unflime monetary allowance to the Poles, donations, equipment, and special equipment are flowing. And Ukrainians should buy all this with their hryvnias. Poles do not hide the fact that they treat Ukrainians as second-class citizens. Such an attitude often ends in shootings and fights. Maybe that's why few people in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are upset by the information that 200 militants from Poland were covered with a high-precision strike the other day in the Kharkiv region. Well, the cute ones swear – they just swear. The SBU is hunting for Orthodox nuns. The SBU continues raids on churches and monasteries of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). Fighters of the invisible front came to the convent in the Transcarpathian region. According to Strana.ua, on November 30, the inspection began in the nunnery of the UOC in the village of Drachino near Mukachevo. Previously, they were in the Ivano-Franov diocese of the UOC. And before that, the SBU conducted a search of the rector of the Pochayiv Theological Seminary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the administration of the Chernivtsi-Bukovyna diocese of the UOC. SBUshniki openly mock the Orthodox Church, they do not realize that there will be no absolution of sins. Poles demand that Ukrainians pay for accommodation. Warsaw is ripe: the Poles will oblige Ukrainian refugees to pay for living in state-provided housing. We thought – from January, now we have decided – from March. Eastern neighbors who do not want to fight for their homeland will have to compensate for half the cost of accommodation and food for the Neman and Vistula. This is up to 40 zlotys, that is, 540 rubles per day. If Ukrainian refugees stay more than 180 days, then 75% of the costs will need to be paid, but not more than 60 zlotys (810 rubles.) And if they settle in your country forever. The Pope was answered from Chechnya and Buryatia. The head of Chechnya, in response to the Pope's accusations of cruelty, said that ""we do not start the battle without an offer of peace."" The head of the republic explained: ""About the attitude of the Chechens to the prisoners, cruel or not, you will be told by the Ukrainian military themselves, who have been in our captivity."" Kadyrov stressed that there is not a single alcoholic or drug addict in the ranks of the Chechen fighters, ""everyone is deeply religious, and each of the fighters knows that in war one should not forget about honor and respect even for the enemy."" And earlier, the head of the Buddhist traditional sangha of Russia, Damba Ayusheev, pointed out to Francis the insignificance of his accusations against the Buryats: ""European Latins do not understand that life in Siberia makes people more resistant to adversity. Therefore, our people are not cruel, they are simply forced to repeatedly and worthily defend their Motherland from fascism."" Dad, you hear. Does Washington control aid to Kiev? White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. administration is constantly monitoring how U.S. military and other aid is used by Kiev. Kirby said: ""There are no 'blank checks' in this matter. He said the administration had asked Congress to consider ramping up aid to the independent. That's how unpretentiously the Yankees shift billions from the pocket of the same jacket to another. What kind of air defense will Ukrainians receive from overseas. The head of the office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak said that the States will transfer additional air defense systems to Ukraine by the end of the year. In an interview with the Financial Times, he swung broadly: ""I'm talking about tanks, long-range missiles, airplanes and, of course, air defenses."" The public is waiting for the announcement of rockets to Mars."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4684844/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-11-29,"In the secret unit ""Cascade"" in the zone of the SVO there is a whole detachment of Russian deputies. Who they are and how they serve","The commander of the ""Cascade"" detachment Sablin said that the deputies at the SVO live and serve in equal conditions with the rest of the","- Guys, thank you very much, - Andrei Turchak hesitated a little. - It's hard to overstate what you're doing. If on one side of the sheet you note the labor costs of creating your reconnaissance unit, and on the other - the number of destroyed targets, weapons and equipment ... It's not comparable. I understand intelligence loves silence. But someday everyone will know what you're doing here and how. These words were uttered by the Secretary of the General Council of ""United Russia"" in the twilight of a concrete bunker. Instead of a table there are boxes of shells, around people in camouflage. Until recently, they wore expensive suits and sat in deputy chairs. Not only in the State Duma, but also in the parliaments of cities and regions. And now they are volunteers, they are fighting in a specially created unit in the special operation zone. Not much is known about this squad. No one would have known about it at all if the First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Sergei Kiriyenko and Andrei Turchak had not met with Duma volunteers. The deputy ""squadron"" is part of the operational-combat tactical formation (OBTF) ""Cascade"", which was created in 2017. Volunteer detachments that are joining the formation now are called BARS - Combat Army Reserve Special. Here are a few names of the chosen volunteers: Dmitry Sablin, Dmitry Khubezov, Sergey Sokol, Oleg Golikov, Oleg Kolesnikov, Evgeny Pervyshov... Each of them was trained at the test site and signed a contract with the Ministry of Defense. ""Today is the last day of our training in the military field camp,"" State Duma deputy from Chelyabinsk Oleg Kolesnikov wrote in a social network. - Under the guidance of experienced instructors, he received practical skills in fire, tactical and medical training. Separate sessions were devoted to the construction of mines and their disposal. I heard a lot of valuable advice from people with real combat experience - their every word is important. Let's go to the front line.... That was a couple of weeks ago. And here is his recent entry: ""I serve in bars ""Cascade"". Military intelligence. For obvious reasons, it is impossible to talk about where I am and what I am doing."" ""I am going to the special operation zone tonight, - this is the publication of the former mayor of Krasnodar, State Duma deputy from the ""United Russia"" Yevgeny Pervyshov. - At the training ground in the Rostov region, I was trained, the experience of service in the army helped to complete it faster. In such cases, ""for the ribbon"" is sent ahead of schedule. After arriving in the part, I will not lead the telegram channel. I think the reasons are clear. Victory will be ours!. Pervyshov, as it turned out at a meeting with Turchak, commands a small group and prepares it for independent combat work. Probably, he has already prepared: the commander of the entire deputy detachment, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Dmitry Sablin, told Turchak that there were a few days left to study. Sablin was commanded by God himself to command the deputy squadron. He is a reserve colonel, born in Mariupol. And the idea to gather volunteer deputies in one combat cell belongs to him. What exactly the people's representatives are doing on the front line is not disclosed. I was able to contact Sablin, among other things I tried to clarify this. ""We are carrying out reconnaissance tasks,"" was the reply. That's it, period. And here are sablin's words. - We are very worried about the mobilized guys and understand that their lives depend on the quality of our work. Therefore, we try to protect the equipment. And at the same time, we work, we give our best. Guys sometimes start in the early morning and finish at 3 a.m. And so it is every day. In general, my colleagues amaze me. A deputy is not a deputy, we are all fighters here, we live and work in the same conditions as the rest. And we have one motto: the defeated goal is to save lives. There is a deputy intelligence service on the entire front. There are, by the way, volunteer parliamentarians who serve in other units. For example, MP Badma Bashankaev is a surgeon, at the front he works in a military hospital. The chairman of the ""Union of Volunteers of Donbass"" MP Alexander Borodai heads several detachments in the DPR at once. And DEPUTY Vitaly Milonov serves as an artilleryman in Horlivka. In the Donbass, he received the call sign ""Gustav"", enlisted in the calculation of the MT-12 ""Rapira"" anti-tank gun. ""This is a jewelry tool that can hit directly in the eye, so as not to spoil the skin,"" Milonov said. ""Every day we destroy several targets and provide our motorized riflemen-attack aircraft with the opportunity to move forward. At least 100, 200, 300 meters. Recently, the whole of Mayorsk was laid out. Hopefully we can implement a larger offensive. The main thing is that ammunition should be in abundance. And it doesn't rust behind us. ""Most people here don't know we're serving nearby. The commander of the deputy detachment, Dmitry Sablin, through his assistants, answered several questions from Komsomolka. - What kind of MPs entered the Cascade subdivision. - State Duma deputies serve in it, mainly from United Russia, and regional parliaments. As well as experienced fighters and volunteers from the ""Combat Brotherhood"" and our youth from the ""Young Guard"". - In what conditions do deputies live and serve. - Same as other military personnel. Since they work in all regions of Russia, where the special operation zone takes place. But depending on the duty station, there may be differences. We have a group that has tap water in its location. The rest can only envy. - How other fighters treat you. - It's okay to treat those who don't talk, but clearly do their job. Well treated. Most do not know that deputies serve next to them. We don't advertise it. Including for security reasons. - Like the mood in the squad. - When it is possible to give a result, the mood is good. - Did you have to use ""official position"" to improve the delivery of equipment and equipment to the front. - I do not know what it means in this case to ""use official position"", but we and many other deputies from the first days helped civilians, and our army, and the people's militia of the DPR, LPR. Especially now, when people serve side by side, eat from the same cauldron. - Is there any evidence that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ""hunting"" for volunteer MPs. - We do not advertise the presence of deputies here. Including in order not to expose those who are fighting nearby to additional risk. Having gone to the front, the deputies do not abandon political activity. On the social networks of some of them, there are reports of events in their constituencies. There were even negative comments about it. For example, when Vitaly Milonov was seen in the Kremlin. ""That's right, I was obliged to attend the signing ceremony of agreements on the entry of new regions into Russia,"" the deputy explained. The commander of the deputy unit, Dmitry Sablin, explained such a ""part-time job"". - Of course, we try to monitor what is happening in the districts where people have entrusted us with mandates. A large load on our teams, assistants who continue to work. And sometimes these problems can be monitored without interrupting the service. By the way, there are many of our voters among those who have been mobilized. Sometimes, they find out. We meet like family.

There is a cultural exchange between the regions, exhibitions are opened, sports events for professionals and amateurs are held. Tell us more about them","The last time the stage in the Dmitrov House of Culture was repaired 40 years ago. Over the years, everything has deteriorated - from the floor to the equipment. Thanks to the help of the Russian authorities, the main place of the House of Culture will be completely restored and renovated. Work goes on non-stop. Soon the House of Culture will again delight the audience. Little residents of Berdyansk help to make their hometown better. Near the Palace of Culture ""Mayak"" children planted linden seedlings. Even the kids were involved. Thanks to their efforts, new trees will delight citizens for many years to come. In Melitopol, a special issue of the magazine ""Rodina"" was presented. This is not just a magazine, but a textbook for secondary school teachers. The issue is dedicated to the great poet and writer Alexander Pushkin. - Pushkin is very necessary for all Russian children without exception. Not only on the monuments, where he will definitely return throughout the Zaporizhzhya region after the liberation of our cities, he will be in the focus of attention of all those who work with children and youth, - said the head of the Department of Culture and Interethnic Relations of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Zaporizhzhya region Tatyana Slesarenko. The Kiev authorities hated Pushkin, they demolished monuments to the poet and banned his books. But Russian culture cannot be abolished. A resident of Melitopol Alina Bezverkhnya worthily represented our region in the national musical project ""Univervision-2022"". A 1st year student of the Moscow State University named after A. S. Makarenko performed in the city of Syktyvkar (Komi Republic). At the heart of ""Univervision"" is a creative competition between performers, organized on the principle of ""Eurovision"". Alina did not pass to the final of the competition, but she was remembered by the audience for her bright performance. And most importantly, she gained new experience of working with the professional composition of the jury members and with colleagues from different regions. On Mother's Day, which is celebrated on the last Sunday of November, pupils of the Children's Art School of Melitopol prepared an exhibition of drawings. The children drew their mothers in the atmosphere of ordinary peaceful life - happy and beautiful. The Melitopol City Museum of Local Lore hosts a mini-exhibition ""Leisurely paints on the palette"". It is dedicated to the 95th anniversary of the birth of Kiselev Vasily Petrovich - landscape artist, teacher, designer, as well as the initiator of the creation of the first art school in Melitopol. Melitopol needlewomen took part in the project ""Embroidered Map of Russia"", organized in Chuvashia. Needlewomen send fragments of embroideries of those patterns that are characteristic of their region. The organizers add them to a large map. The project is also online. When you click on a region, information about it and an annotation to embroidery drawings appear. Embroideries with patterns were sent by needlewomen from the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Soon they will be added to the embroidered map of Russia. Representatives of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of The Zaporizhzhya region paid a visit to the sanatorium ""Zdravnitsa"" in Yevpatoria. Now children from the new territories of Russia rest and study there. Deputy Minister of Culture and Sports of Zaporizhzhya region Yuriy Kovanov met with the accompanying children. ""The main goal now is to help the guys not to lose the experience, form and achievements deserved earlier, and to properly integrate all this into the legal field of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy minister said. According to him, the experience of the Yevpatoria sanatorium will be used in the future to help children. Pupils of the Berdyansk Music School took part in the All-Russian Festival ""Soul of the Bayan"", which was held in Samara. Young musicians reached the super final and became prize-winners of the competition. In addition, the delegation of the Zaporozhye region visited the Crimea, where it participated in the exhibition cycle of the program ""Russian Unity"". There, at the Center for Culture and Arts, artists from the LPR, the DPR, Rostov and the Crimea also showed their works. In particular, the Zaporozhye region was represented by paintings by Dmitry and Olga Barabash from Vasilyevka. The development of culture always goes hand in hand with history and science. Therefore, a regional branch of the Russian Scientific Geographical Society, the oldest in the country, was opened in the Zaporozhye region. It was created on the basis of Melitopol State University named after A. S. Makarenko. ""A return to common scientific traditions will allow the university to take a worthy place in modern Russian education,"" said Andrey Chuikov, rector of the university. The Minister of Culture of the Russian Federation Olga Lyubimova on the eve of the ""government hour"" met with deputies of the faction ""United Russia"". Particular attention was paid to the young regions of Russia. Olga Lyubimova noted that 26,000 people work in the field of culture in the annexed territories, now work is underway with each institution, support is provided. - Russian artists are eager to perform in Donbass and other regions. Collectives of new regions are also preparing for a tour of the country. Starting from March, we try to organize the performances of collectives throughout Russia as much as possible. Cinemas in the new regions have been showing the same repertoire as in the capital for 1.5 months. There is a lot of work ahead, which, I am sure, will bear fruit. Namely, the acquaintance of viewers with the teams of new regions and vice versa, the minister emphasized. The regional championship in freestyle wrestling among boys was held in the region. The best wrestlers of the region took part in the championship. On this day, the Minister of Sports of the Republic of Crimea Olga Tarubarova visited the region for the first time. She noted the high level of training of athletes and stressed that thanks to the continuous training process, the guys managed to reach a high level. And before that, in Enerhodar, on the basis of the Manzuli Boxing School, a regional martial arts festival ""Strength in Unity"" was held. Know the country you live in. Zaporozhye region for the first time took part in the ethnographic dictation. It was held in 89 regions of Russia. His tasks were designed in the form of a test of 30 questions, which registered participants had to answer in 45 minutes. Two-thirds of the questions are related to general data for Russia and abroad. The remaining 10 were devoted to the region of the participants. The maximum result that could be scored for the correct completion of all tasks is 100 points. The purpose of the action is to arouse the desire of Russian citizens to study their roots, traditions and culture of their ancestors, to learn more about those who live nearby. - For us, such experience is important. It is especially valuable to share such initiatives together with the whole of Russia, being its full citizens, - noted in the Department of Culture of the Zaporozhye region. By the way, there is another opportunity to test your knowledge. Until November 27, the All-Russian Environmental Dictation is held on the ecodictant.rus portal, as well as on regional and foreign sites. Participants will be asked to answer 25 questions on Russian nature reserves, the Arctic and Lake Baikal."

Work is constant: first, the windows in the houses are closed with a film, and then double-glazed windows are installed in turn. A hostel is also being repaired here, in which they plan to settle families who have lost their homes. On each floor there will be a kitchen, toilet and shower. Builders have already installed a heating system and started finishing work. The city has restored the work of the boiler house, residents receive heat. - Replaced the network pumps, boilers, pipeline part. The boiler house has been launched, it has already entered the mode.

In 80% of the houses of Severodonetsk, gas supply has been restored. Electricity is still partial. But in Kremennaya and Rubezhnoye electricity returned completely.

The work did not stop there, the pace is only growing. - The heating season has already started somewhere, somewhere there is destruction, somewhere there are still unclosed contours, but you just need to be a little more patient. We will definitely finish everything. Be sure to close the thermal contours, windows, restore the roofs, supply heat. This task has been set by the government, we will certainly fulfill it,"" said Valery Leonov, Deputy Minister of Construction and Housing and Communal Services of Russia. According to him, next year Russian comprehensive programs for the replacement and modernization of infrastructure, utilities and dilapidated housing will already be operating in the republic. Secondary school No. 1 in Kirovsk is undergoing major repairs. The room is almost 90 years old, and during this time it has not been updated once. The builders strengthened the foundation of the school, stabilized the soil, replaced the heating system and made electrics. In the Lugansk Clinical Oncology Center, the gynecological department is being repaired. Repairs are carried out by the builders of the contracting organization ""Trade and Industrial Firm"". They started on November 3, and plan to finish on December 15. The department has not undergone major repairs since 1962, since its construction. - The need for major repairs of the building is long overdue. This year, funds were allocated, now the first stage of work is being carried out. In addition to repairing the gynecology room, it is planned to repair ventilation systems in several buildings, - said Oleksiy Zhigalo, Deputy Chief Physician of the Luhansk Oncology Center for the Technical Part. Road workers have completed work on the highway of republican significance M04, connecting the LPR with the DPR. Specialists have laid more than 38 kilometers of asphalt and are now engaged in ramps, apply markings and install road signs. In Debaltseve, the reconstruction of the right side of the overpass was completed and the dismantling of beams and ceilings on the left side began. In Lugansk, traffic on the overpass on Taras Rybas Street has recently opened. It was repaired by Moscow specialists of Gormost. Traffic on the overpass has been closed since the summer of 2021, after a nearby gas pipeline was blown up. The overhaul of the road in Lugansk along Artema Street is also coming to an end. There they dismantled the tram rails, expanded the roadway, laid curbs and made storm drains. With the coordination of the Ministry of Construction of Russia, 23 sections of road routes were repaired in the republic. By the end of the year, 14 roads will be put into operation and 8 repaired bridges will be opened. COMMENTS. Acting Head of the Lugansk People's Republic Leonid Pasechnik. - Luhansk region has never before received such assistance, which is now provided by the Russian Federation. The work organized by the Russian government and the leadership of the regions to help our republic restore its infrastructure and economy is very significant. To be honest, the region had never received such assistance long before 2014. A significant part of the roads in the republic has been restored to an ideal condition, power lines, heat and power plants are being restored, new water pipelines are being built. As for the destroyed territories of ours, all this is temporary. Of course, all this will be restored, of course, we will do all this capitally, reliably, in accordance with GOSTs. The budget for next year will be unequivocally increased in terms of the projected allocation of money for the restoration of everything destroyed, everything that suffered as a result of hostilities."

Lectures and master classes for schoolchildren and students were conducted by leading experts of completely different industries,"About 300 young and talented children from all over Russia gathered on November 9 in the children's camp of Berdyansk to learn what journalism, youth policy and the development of their own projects are. It was these topics that the first district youth educational forum of the Zaporozhye region ""South of the Young"" was devoted. Four days of communication, training and interesting events were waiting for the guests of the forum. - Guys from all over the country could take part in the forum. Basically, these were schoolchildren and students from the southern district - Zaporozhye, Kherson regions, Lugansk and Donetsk YPeople's Republics, Crimea, - yulia Klimenko, head of the youth movement ""South Young"", told Komsomolka. To participate, all interested children from 17 to 25 years old just had to fill out a questionnaire on the Internet. Then volunteers took care of everything. - We called the guys and organized a transfer for them, so that everyone could get there comfortably, without unnecessary fuss and problems, - said Julia. As such, the forum did not have a narrow direction this year. The organizers tried to cover as many areas as possible so that each of the guests would find something to their liking. - Our goal was to tell what youth policy is. The guests of the forum shared information about existing social movements, gave lectures, told stories from their own lives, which should inspire a new generation. Each of the participants could choose for himself which lesson or lecture he should go to. Everything depends on the interests, - Yulia Klimenko shared with ""KP"". And there were a lot of directions at the forum. For example, on the first day, the master class was held by the deputy head of Rosmolodezh Denis Ashirov. His lecture was about personal growth and support measures for volunteers. - The forum brought together young, bright guys who are ready to create something new. They talked a lot about how to create new projects, motivate children to work in public organizations, develop them,"" said Denis Ashirov. For many, it was important to hear words of support and understanding from prominent figures in order to one day stand in line with them. - Talent without opportunities means nothing. Today you have the opportunity - discover your talents, open your hearts to the world! Your main advantage is youth and courage, - addressed the participants of the forum acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky, who visited its opening. On the second day of the forum, war correspondents Semyon Pegov and Vladlen Tatarsky gave their lectures to young people. During the interactive, they told how to run their telegram channel and remain interesting for the audience. Journalist Ruslan Konovalov turned the audience into speakers, revealing the secrets of the perfect performance in public. Most of the reports were devoted to volunteer projects. The guys who came from the liberated territories know more than anyone what volunteers are capable of in difficult times, and how important it is what they do. As a result of the forum, many of its participants had their own ideas, which seem to be not so difficult to embody after all the lectures."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686938/,Olga AFANASYEVA,2022-11-30,We will not be left without products,We tell you how in the Zaporozhye region they work with entrepreneurs and make sure that prices remain at an affordable level,"The issue of food security of the Zaporizhzhya region remains a priority for the authorities. The work is aimed at providing the region with products of local producers, and at delivering to its territory a sufficient number of goods from the Rostov region, the DPR. Of course, local enterprises that are concerned about the need to export their products also receive assistance. For example, a new route for the movement of heavy trucks through the DPR to Rostov was recently established, just to organize the sale of agricultural products. And after the restoration of the highway ""Odessa - Melitopol - Novoazovsk"" logistics will become even easier and more profitable. Rural fairs, which are held regularly, also help to find buyers. It was thanks to them that agreements were concluded on the supply of products of local farmers to the DPR, Kherson and Rostov regions, and at producer prices. Processing enterprises work without interruptions, also buying raw materials from farmers, and then selling their products in local stores. - I am grateful to agricultural producers for the fact that in difficult conditions they continue to work and supply quality products not only to our region, but also to neighboring ones. I want to assure you that at present there is no shortage of food products in the markets of the Zaporizhzhya region, - said the acting governor of the region Yevhen Balitsky. The guarantor of food security in the region remains small business, those people who are most interested in the success of their work on the production and sale of consumer goods. They have questions every day: on the new taxation system, the formation of the ruble exchange rate against the hryvnia, work with buyers. Representatives of authorities, relevant departments, and the tax service help to solve emerging difficulties. Recently, a round table for entrepreneurs on topical issues was held in Melitopol. It was attended by directors of trading platforms, local markets, individual entrepreneurs. It turned out, for example, that the issue of the exchange rate of monetary units is still relevant. After the hryvnia exchange rate against the ruble fell from 1.5 to 1.25, many complaints are received from buyers. Representatives of the Ministry of Tariffs and Price Regulation explained that now the rate for everyone is the same and a similar ""multiplier"" should be applied everywhere, regardless of the site. You can tell about the problems with prices in the chatbot in the telegram @patrulcen_bot. Employees of the department are constantly conducting inspections. So, recently they checked the wholesale bases on Polevoy Street - special attention is always paid to the prices of socially significant food and non-food products. Also, at the same time, inspectors look at the storage conditions of products in warehouses and the quality of the storage places themselves. In order for people to have fewer questions, more information is needed: special leaflets with explanations are placed in markets and stores. Another topical issue is work in the conditions of the transition period, restructuring under the new regulatory framework. Especially entrepreneurs are interested in taxation issues. Since January, the Russian tax system will operate in the region, but now everyone is working according to the previously adopted regulatory acts. A simplified taxation system has been introduced for all entrepreneurs, in fact, they pay turnover tax. From January, it will be necessary to switch to new rails and it will be necessary for entrepreneurs to register as subjects of Russian territory. Already now you can learn all about the transition to the new rules in the local tax offices, which serve as centers for business registration. Registration of business in new subjects is free of charge (without paying the state fee) for both the existing and the business being created. IMPORTANT. For farmers - subsidies. In the Zaporozhye region, there are benefits for entrepreneurs who themselves grow winter wheat, barley and rapeseed, as well as produce milk. Documents for obtaining a subsidy can be issued in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Policy of the Zaporizhzhya region or in the territorial administration at the location of the agricultural enterprise. They will provide a list of documents that need to be collected. Who can get help. individuals and legal entities (except for personal subsidiary plots). working in Zaporozhye region. registered with the tax and tax authorities of the region. have no tax arrears. who have not previously received funds from the budget of the Zaporizhzhya region.

The second quarter has begun. According to the administration of the Kherson region, only those educational institutions that are located on the relatively safe territories of the right bank resumed work after a long vacation. - Due to the threat of shelling and evacuation, a number of educational institutions will temporarily not function. Among them are schools in Kherson, Belozersky, Berislavsky, Snigirevsky, Aleshkinsky, Holoprystansky, Kakhovsky, Novokakhovsky, Gornostaevsky, Velikolepetikhsky and Verkhnerogachiksky municipal districts, the administration specified. In other schools, the educational process is going according to plan. At the same time, the administration of the Kherson region added that the educational process continues in accordance with the education system of the Russian Federation. According to the Minister of Education of kherson region Mikhail Rodikov, there are 65 schools in the region, where 10 thousand children remain to study. ""Our children are magnificent, which means that the country has a great future ahead of us,"" he said. The evacuated residents of Kherson, who want to place their children in schools in other regions of the country, will not have difficulties. - You are welcome in schools, you are expected in kindergartens. If you went to Anapa, to Novorossiysk, to Simferopol, to any city in Russia, there are always schools nearby. You just take the birth certificate of the child, who managed to take a certificate from school - take it and go to a general educational institution. If you did not have time to take a certificate, we are ready to send any supporting document at the request of the school, - Mikhail Rodikov assured. A child is enrolled in school on the basis of an application by a parent (legal representative). - If a child arrives accompanied by a relative or other person who does not have the legal right to represent the interests of a particular child, or is unaccompanied, he will be admitted to school on the basis of a statement by a relative, another person or on the basis of a personal statement by a child who has reached the age of 14 years. If there are documents on training, the child is enrolled in the class corresponding to the class in which he studied earlier. If there are no documents, an intermediate certification (without assessment) will be carried out to determine the class of training, the authorities specified. To register in a kindergarten, parents need to contact the municipal education authorities at the place of their location. At the same time, take an identity document with you; the child's birth certificate; a document of registration or a document confirming the fact of residence in the territory of the municipality. KSTAT. Professional examinations of children are carried out in all four new subjects of the Russian Federation: in Kherson, Zaporozhye regions, as well as in the LPR and DPR. The Russian government allocated more than 353 million rubles for children's examinations. These funds in the form of a subsidy were sent from the government's reserve fund to the National Medical Research Center for Children's Health of the Ministry of Health of Russia. Gradually, the health care system in the Kherson region is adapting to work according to all-Russian standards. Local residents continue to issue CHI policies, according to which you can receive free medical care not only in their native region, but also in other subjects of Russia. ""The healthcare system should be patient-oriented and built on the principles of accessibility of all types of medical care,"" said Mikhail Murashko, Minister of Health of the Russian Federation."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686934/,Elena KOSTRYKINA,2022-11-30,Schoolchildren again sat at their desks,Professional doctors and 11 mobile laboratories were sent to the region,"Children must be healthy. In order to identify and diagnose diseases in time, professional examinations and medical examinations of young patients are carried out in the Kherson region, according to the order of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. - Today, one of the important projects of the Ministry of Health of Russia is preventive examinations and medical examination of children and adolescents from the DPR, LPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. To do this, we have attracted highly professional specialists, we use modern equipment, - said the Minister of Health of the Russian Federation Mikhail Murashko. Examinations of children are carried out by specialists from other regions of Russia. Medical teams arrived in Kherson region with 11 mobile laboratories, which are equipped with all necessary equipment. Each child undergoes a comprehensive examination by seven doctors. On the spot, take the necessary tests, take a cardiogram and conduct ultrasound examinations. Acting Governor of Kherson region Volodymyr Saldo visited one of these mobile laboratories and recalled his school days. - I remember when I went to school, a car drove up, in which we were given an X-ray. Probably, this is such a good tradition, but already on more modern equipment, which makes it possible to study the health and development of the child in depth. Doctors who arrived from other regions of Russia have already examined more than 180 children. In Henichesk, they plan to examine another 200 preschoolers. In addition, mobile laboratories will unite settlements in other districts of Kherson region. - First of all, we conduct professional examinations in preschool educational institutions. Then we begin to carry out these events in schools, - said Volodymyr Ilmiev, Minister of Health of Kherson region. The curator of the group of Russian doctors, Alexei Dotsenko, noted that the work is going according to plan, doctors interact with the regional Ministry of Health and the education department. Doctors quickly solve emerging problems."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686963/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-02,The main shrine was taken away from the Orthodox Christians of Ukraine,Kiev-Pechersk Lavra was officially transferred to the schismatic OCU,"Events with the humiliation and destruction in Ukraine of the only canonical Orthodox Church of the UOC (Moscow Patriarchate) began to develop not quickly, but very quickly. Recall, on Thursday, Zelensky in an evening video message announced the decision of the NSDC to instruct the government to send to the Parliament of Ukraine a bill on a complete ban on the activities of religious organizations ""associated with the aggressor state"". First of all, of course, it was about the UOC, the primate of which is Metropolitan Onufriy. But the agenda of the NSDC meeting was not limited to this. The UOC was taken seriously and thoroughly. And this structure, under the leadership of veterinarian-lawyer Alexei Danilov, who growled about the need to destroy everything Russian, made a comprehensive decision, including instructing the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience to conduct a religious studies examination of the Charter on the Management of the UOC for the presence of a church-canonical connection with the Moscow Patriarchate (and, if necessary, to take the measures provided for by law – who would doubt that the necessary results of the examination are already on someone's desk). And, in addition, ""to ensure verification of the existence of legal grounds and compliance with the conditions for the use by religious organizations of property that is located on the territory of the National Kiev-Pechersk Historical and Cultural Reserve."" And, in the end, there was a demand to apply personal sanctions. Less than a day later, the leader of the schismatics, Metropolitan Epiphanius, the leader of the OCU / UCU (Holy Church of Ukraine), evicted the primate of the UOC from his residence, taking away from the UOC one of the main shrines of all world Orthodoxy - the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. The representative of the OCU / UCU Evstratiy Zorya has already reported in the social network that now a new governor, his boss Metropolitan Epiphanius, rules in the Lavra. And ""the corresponding entry has already appeared in the state register."" - On December 1, 2022, the charter of the Holy Dormition Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (monastery) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Orthodox Church of Ukraine) was registered. Information about this legal entity as part of the Local Church was entered on December 2 in the Unified State Register, he wrote in the account. And he probably did not understand that he had sold his other patron – the current president of Ukraine (so far) Volodymyr Zelensky. After all, if the Charter was already registered before Zelensky's speech and the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on this issue, it turns out that the Ukrainian state in the form of these officials in silence has already decided everything before, and Zelensky and Danilov only legalized this raider seizure after the fact. Therefore, one should not pull a fig leaf of decency on the globe of Ukrainian shamelessness with all these ""instruct, establish, conduct an examination"", etc. These ridiculous body movements of Zelensky only emphasize that he is well aware of the illegality of his actions. But it's so Ukrainian! Recall that the current head of the UCU, Metropolitan Epiphanius, for a long time was loyal and obedient to the so-called ""patriarch"" of the UOC of the Kyiv Patriarchate (KP) Filaret, but when creating a new confession in Ukraine by the then President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko and the Patriarch of Constantinople, he managed to deceive Filaret and betrayed him, taking the reins of power of the UCU into his own hands. One could assume that Zelensky unleashed in Ukraine, in addition to the existing conflicts, also a religious war, the seeds of which were sown by Poroshenko and Bartholomew in 2018, but only there will be no religious war. Perhaps it could flare up in 2014, even in the same 2018, but in 2022 it is already some fantasies in the ""Ukrainian style"". That someone will now come and start fighting, defending their faith and fighting it off the schismatics. For example, aliens. Except that all hope is on them. Because the leaders of the UOC-MP have already shown their weakness. At the first serious attacks on them, they turned into Ukrainian patriots, declared their independence from the Russian Orthodox Church, began to organize gatherings for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, pray ""for the victory of Ukrainian weapons."" And even being put on the edge of the ""shooting ravine"", in response to the extremely tough speech of Zelensky, who decided to rule not only the state of Ukraine, but also Ukrainian Orthodoxy, they issued their own statement, sustained in ""pitiful tones"". No Christian steadfastness and willingness to endure torment for the ""Orthodox faith"", but a continuous dispute between economic entities. - The UOC has always carried out its activities in accordance with Ukrainian legislation. The updated charter of the UOC, adopted in May of this year, has already been repeatedly studied by professional religious scholars. It is obvious that one more of his examinations will not lead to any sensation, - reads the statement on behalf of the canonical UPCU. - For an objective understanding of the situation with the premises of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, it is important to compare it with the state of this shrine after decades of desolation, when in 1988 it was returned to the Church. Then many of its majestic and world-famous temples were in ruins. And it was the UOC that raised them from the ashes. Not to you accuse Zelensky and his team of exceeding, not words about the readiness to defend the main shrine of Ukrainian Orthodoxy to the last monk. Not an appeal to novices and parishioners to stand up for themselves. A solid ""spare"", and ""innocent we"". Torturing such for sadists is a pleasure. If not two in one.

The Children's Ombudsman held a meeting in Henichesk with relevant departments to develop mechanisms for operational assistance. First of all, this applies to those children who are left without parents and need professional care. Thus, 52 pupils of a boarding house for children with special needs were near the front line. The guys were urgently evacuated to a safe place. ""We promptly contacted the specialists of the Ministry of Health of Russia, and 15 ambulances were sent to transport the children,"" Lvova-Belova said. There are enough cases of a quick and coordinated response in the Kherson region. The health, and sometimes the life of children, depends on it. The Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights drew attention to the creation of a shelter for children who do not yet have a family. - At the moment, all such institutions have remained in the territory where active hostilities are being conducted. The only refuge for the children now is the children's hospital. It is important that they are in normal conditions, with the full range of services that they require,"" the children's ombudsman noted. It is also necessary to monitor the evacuation of children who are taken out of social institutions, saving from bombing. During the visit, Maria Lvova-Belova visited the hospital where children left without parental care live. She gave them toys, books and stationery. All the surprises for the children were purchased at the expense of the humanitarian action of the commissioner ""For children - in their hands"". She also met with students of a boarding school for children with respiratory diseases, learned how the school year goes. - With colleagues, we worked out system solutions for the future. For example, on psychological-medical-pedagogical commissions, which should be created in the Ministry of Education and help children build an educational route,"" the commissioner said. Kherson region is the fourth new region of Russia, which was visited by Maria Lvova-Belova. According to her, emergency assistance to children and families with children is needed everywhere."

Not for the first month, humanitarian aid collected by volunteers, organizations and ordinary residents of the country comes to the region from different cities of the country. Activists actively support the Zaporizhzhya region. Moreover, the assistance is comprehensive: from food packages for local residents, ending with municipal equipment for city services and equipment for defenders of the Motherland. Thus, young people from the Yaroslavl region recently handed over assistance to volunteers of the Sudoplatov battalion, formed on the initiative of residents who want to defend their land. And there are a lot of them. - Volunteers come en masse. We look at them, we refuse many of them. Not without it. For example, people born in 1960, 1961, 1962 want to join the battalion. They didn't. I understand them, they want to fight fascism. But we focus on fighters under 55 years old. We take those who have combat training. And there are also a lot of such guys, - said the deputy commander of the detachment Yevgeny Gorlachev. By the way, the son of the acting head of the administration of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky Alexander also signed up as a volunteer in the battalion. - I am grateful to the residents of a great country for their help and attention. Moral support is just as important today as humanitarian support. Our guys know that behind them is a huge country, every inhabitant, every mother and every father. We are one family in which there are no other people's children, there is support and our common victory, - Yevgeny Balitsky thanked the volunteers for their help to the battalion of volunteers.

Healthcare in the new Russian region is also receiving support. Thus, the fleet of local hospitals was replenished with 69 new ambulances. According to the chief physician of the Melitopol Regional Center for Emergency Medical Care Yuri Reznichenko, this became possible thanks to the participation of the region in the state program. - Currently, 69 ambulances have been received under the state program of the Russian Federation.

Cars in Melitopol and the district are undergoing the registration procedure in the traffic police and in the near future will go on the lines to work as intended, - Reznichenko commented to the media. Old machines will be transferred to the technical support service. Recently, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Tatyana Lobach visited the Zaporozhye region on a humanitarian mission. She handed over assistance to the regional maternity hospital, the Children's and Youth Sports School and the Center for Children Left Without Parental Care. - We always feel the huge support of the federal center, starting from solving humanitarian issues and ending with regulatory and legal issues. I am always grateful for genuine attention and practical participation in solving all the problems of the region, - commented on the results of the visit Evgeny Balitsky. Thanks to such strong support from the federal center and the regions, today all hospitals of the Zaporozhye region are fully provided.

According to the head of the Melitopol administration, Galina Danilchenko, a total of five cars were delivered to them: two combined road vehicles with attachments (one of which will work in the district), a water truck for Vodokanal and two cars for garbage collection. ""The fact is that the former Ukrainian authorities, leaving the city, stole a lot of equipment that was not taken away - damaged,"" commented the governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev, who brought the equipment to the sponsored region. - During my visit to the city, in addition to communal issues, we discussed many other topical issues with the head of Melitopol. First of all, the task of forming the budget for the next year. Our specialists will help with the preparation of this important document. We have also developed a program of assistance in the field of communal infrastructure for Melitopol and the Melitopol district: this is the gas sector, water supply, and heat. According to Mikhail Razvozhaev, money from the federal budget was sent to provide patronage assistance to Sevastopol. ""But in the summer we worked at the expense of charitable foundations, so we also send this money to the sponsored territories: Starobilsk district of the LPR, Melitopol and Melitopol district of Zaporizhia region,"" he concluded. A very necessary gift of the Zaporozhye region was made by Veliky Novgorod. The Novgorod Chemical-Industrial College handed over professional literature and textbooks to the Dniprorudny Vocational Lyceum. - Now the studies will go well, - the lyceum is sure. Also, the chiefs personally brought gifts to the pupils of the Kamyanko-Dnipro boarding school in the Vasilyevsky district. Volunteers handed the children warm clothes, backpacks, writing utensils, food, hygiene products and heaters. - Many children in the liberated territories really need patronage assistance. And such attention is very important for them, - commented the acting director of the boarding school Nina Gurskaya."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686793/,Marina SMIRNOVA,2022-11-30,Irkutsk helps to restore Kirovsk,Specialists from Siberia have already rebuilt over 50 facilities destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"Naturally, it is impossible to restore everything that has been destroyed over the years overnight. Therefore, the plan for the restoration of Kirovsk, developed by the Irkutsk residents, is deployed for 5 years. - Some facilities have been particularly badly damaged in recent years. For example, a Ukrainian shell hit the roof of a children's and youth sports school. The roof has already been repaired, the ceiling and lighting have been restored, the windows are being strengthened and the exterior facade is being repaired. School No. 3 overhauled the assembly hall and replaced the windows in the hall. In school No. 1, we carry out major repairs of the entire building. We strengthened the foundation there, stabilized the soil, replaced the heating system and did all the electrics. In the kindergarten ""Sun"" the heating was changed, - said Igor Kobzev, summing up the results of the first phase of restoration work in the sponsored city. In total, as of mid-November, 55 facilities have been restored, including the local swimming pool. Siberians handed over four transformer substations and 11 transformers to Kirovsk. The equipment will be used in the city, as well as in the village. Donetsk and Chervonogvardeyskoye. The transformers themselves should have been changed a long time ago. But the equipment planned for replacement was smashed by shells of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And the other has completely exhausted the service life. The old equipment was 40 years old - in Ukraine, no one thought about replacing it. - New transformers will now provide bright light and stable voltage in the homes of Kirov residents. In the old transformer, there is no level of voltage regulation at the output. And the modern one allows it. That is, if there is either an overestimated or understated voltage through the network, we can adjust it, -explained Alexander Gorbatyuk, acting head of the Kirovsky district of electric networks of the state enterprise Republican Grid Company. All schools and kindergartens of Kirovsk received from the Irkutsk region equipment for catering units, as well as educational literature, laptops. And in cultural institutions, employees of the Irkutsk Ministry of Culture brought musical instruments and stage costumes. - Thanks to the mayor's office of Irkutsk, the uniform for the primary school of the Kirov multidisciplinary gymnasium was sewn. Also from Siberia came humanitarian cargo with body armor for the Kirov Ministry of Emergency Situations. Our guys often have to put out fires, dismantle the rubble under fire, so Irkutsk and the Irkutsk region took care of rescuers, - added the mayor of Kirovsk Victoria Sergeeva. Among the delivered there are warm clothes for the townspeople. Igor Kobzev promised that next year the Siberian region will continue to supply humanitarian aid to Kirovsk, and builders from the Irkutsk region will work on restoring the infrastructure. - Already now, many issues of financing go through the Irkutsk region, they will continue to go. What is planned for 2023, we will fulfill and we will continue to work, the governor said. THAT TIME. Siberians will help with Christmas decorations. Irkutsk will acquire illuminations and lighting to decorate Kirovsk for the New Year, said the mayor of the Siberian city Ruslan Bolotov. ""The head of the city appealed to us with a request to help decorate Kirovsk for the New Year. After the battles with the nationalists, there were no illuminations, lights, decorations left in the city. In Irkutsk, we will organize a holiday at a decent level, and at the expense of partners who used to go to the fireworks, we will buy registration for the city of the LPR, ""Bolotov wrote in his telegram channel. THERE ARE WOMEN. A Siberian woman who surprised everyone. The governor of the Irkutsk region, Igor Kobzev, told the story of a resident of Kirovsk, Galina Razuvaeva, who attracted attention with her care for the builders who came to the LPR. Every day she came to the construction site and treated Irkutsk residents to hot cakes. I didn't skimp on kind words. It turned out that Galina Razuvaeva was born in Norilsk, but then moved to the Luhansk region. She gave birth to two sons. The youngest, Dmitry, in 2014 went to the front line, to defend the Donbass. As part of the People's Militia of the LPR, he fought until 2017, and then died. The eldest, Yuri, was so amazed by this news that he had a stroke. Now Galina alone is nursing her sick son. - Our guys could not remain indifferent to her story. They found out that the woman's house had a leaking roof. We came to visit, assessed the situation. A few days later, slate was brought in and the roof was relaid. I myself visited Galina Vasilyevna, I was amazed at her vitality and perseverance. I understand that now the main thing for her is to raise her son. We are negotiating with the hospital of medical rehabilitation in the city of Saki, in the Crimea, - said Igor Kobzev."

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Pray to God — victory is from Him. God is our general, He leads us,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And the soldiers were instructed as follows: ""Where a deer passes, a Russian soldier will pass there. Where a deer does not pass, a Russian soldier will still pass."" THREE MISSILES - THREE ARMORED VEHICLES. Senior Sergeant Denis VERKHOTURO. ""As part of the crew of the combat vehicle, the operator of the platoon of anti-tank guided missiles, Senior Sergeant Denis Verkhoturov, was in a camouflaged firing position, covering one of the tank-dangerous directions of the enemy's offensive. Conducting observation, the crew commander detected the advance of the enemy in the direction of the defensive lines of the motorized rifle company. Without unmasking the position, the crew continued to observe, despite the artillery bombardment that had begun. Waiting for the advance of the enemy armored group, Denis Verkhoturov destroyed three enemy armored vehicles with accurate and fast shots from the anti-tank missile system of the combat vehicle. Having suffered losses at the turn of the attack, the enemy retreated without entering the battle. Thanks to the composure and accuracy of the shooting of Senior Sergeant Denis Verkhoturov, the enemy's offensive attempt was thwarted."" A COUNTERATTACK REVEALED THE ENEMY'S POSITIONS. Senior Lieutenant Mikhail KIUSHKI. ""A motorized rifle platoon under the command of Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kiushkin carried out a combat mission to hold the height in one of the areas near the line of contact with the enemy. Ukrainian militants attempted to break through the defenses. Thanks to decisive actions and competent management of the unit, all attacks of Ukrainian nationalists on the positions were repulsed by the forces of the platoon. Having repulsed the attack, the platoon under the command of Senior Lieutenant Kiushkin, reinforced by tanks, went on the offensive and destroyed the enemy's fortifications, where he secretly accumulated to carry out attacks on the platoon's positions. The competent and unexpected actions of Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kiushkin made it possible to improve the tactical position of Russian units and prevent a breakthrough of the defenses. "" THEY LAUNCHED AN AIRSTRIKE AND RETURNED PAWN. Senior Lieutenant Petr KASHTANO. ""The crew of Senior Lieutenant Pyotr Kashtanov performed a flight to perform a combat mission during a special military operation. When performing a combat flight, the crew reached the target at a given time and delivered an air strike on the accumulation of enemy military equipment. To exclude counteraction to the enemy's air defense, he performed active maneuvering at extremely low altitudes using the entire EW complex of the Su-34 aircraft. After leaving the attack on the combat course, the enemy launched two missiles from MANPADS at the Su-34 aircraft. As a result of getting into the right engine on board the aircraft, a fire and a failure of the control system occurred. With a lack of time, the crew commander made a decision and ejected the crew. The landing of the crew occurred in the territory controlled by the enemy. After landing, the crew commander realized that the right hand was seriously damaged, the left freed from the suspension system. The navigator in an unconscious state landed 50 meters away. Senior Lieutenant Pyotr Kashtanov freed him from the suspension system and immediately applied painkillers to him and himself. In the shortest possible time, Senior Lieutenant Kashtanov, overcoming the pain in his injured arm, carried the navigator on himself and camouflaged himself. The servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine arrived at the landing site in 10-15 minutes and began to comb the area with forces up to the platoon. The enemy, when combing at a distance of 7 meters from the place of shelter of the crew, constantly called on the pilots to come out and surrender, guaranteeing them the preservation of life. Maintaining self-control, not succumbing to provocative actions on the part of the search group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the crew coolly watched the actions of the enemy, being in constant readiness to engage in battle with superior forces. There was no thought of surrendering, only a fight, or the use of a grenade to blow up. Grenades were at the ready. Artillery shelling that began on the Ukrainian side forced their own militants to retreat. In order to prevent the unmasking of their position, the crew decided to move towards their grouping of troops after dark. The commander of the crew, Senior Lieutenant Pyotr Kashtanov, assisted the navigator in moving towards his troops, providing him with his means of anesthesia. Moving through enemy territory, at night bypassing checkpoints, the crew went to their own and was evacuated to the place of deployment of their military unit.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686615/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-02,Zelensky commits reprisals against the Orthodox Church of Ukraine: People's destinies are suspended on strings,"Zelensky put into effect a decision on restrictions on ""Russia-related"" religious organizations","The Orthodox Church of Ukraine, if we are talking about the canonical Christian denomination, and not about the structures of schismatics or sects, is living out its last days. The president of (so far) Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is firm, resolute and consistent in some matters. It is between the Allies that he can rush, choosing between Germany, Britain and the United States, begging for money and weapons from all and flattering each of them. And in relation to the enemy, he is vindictive, spiteful. Especially if the enemy: a) has to do with Russia and the Russian world and b) cannot give an answer. And all these criteria were fully met until recently by the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. ""The NSDC instructed the government to submit to the Verkhovna Rada a bill on the impossibility of the activities in Ukraine of religious organizations affiliated with the centers of influence in the Russian Federation,"" Zelensky said on Thursday in his nightly video message. The same head of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, reported by Zelensky, literally spat saliva and growled with rage, demanding the destruction of everything Russian and all Russians. Taking into account how unquestioningly Zelensky's decisions in Ukraine are being implemented, the fate of the UOC is predetermined. Against the state, it is powerless. Resolutely. Irrevocably. Unambiguously. And consistently. In the spring of this year, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine introduced a bill banning the activities of the canonical UOC, seizing its real estate and other property. But that attempt failed. The law was never passed. And on November 23, Verkhovna Rada deputy Iryna Friz announced that a bill banning the activities of the RoC in Ukraine had again been submitted to parliament. Which is to be expected. In the spring, Zelensky cracked down on the political opposition, banned political parties. Having completed this task, he passed on to those whom he considered the spiritual opposition to his power. This time, the opponents of the UOC prepared thoroughly. Not only the public was involved in the process, but also all the power and strength of the state apparatus, which itself did not mind joining it. The day before Friz's statement, the Ukrainian counterintelligence service of the SBU conducted searches in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, the main monastery and spiritual center of the UOC, the treasures of which have long been sharpened by the teeth of all sorts of schismatics, from the so-called UOC of the Kyiv Patriarchate to the OCU / UCU created together with Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople and ex-President Poroshenko. But if the schismatics are primarily interested only in the property and income of the UOC, then the Ukrainian state is interested exclusively in eradicating everything that has a Russian character and origin or can be called such. Shortly before that, the SBU reported that from February to October it had opened 23 criminal cases against representatives and servants of the UOC. The accusations did not shine with diversity, complicity with the ""aggressor state"", treason, etc. Real results in the ongoing production could not be achieved, and now all these people are suspended on a string. And the viceroy of the Lavra was brought to the notorious website ""Peacemaker"", which publishes personal data of those whom the Ukrainian Nazis consider ""enemies of Ukraine"", up to phone numbers and residential addresses. But it wasn't enough. At the end of November, counterintelligence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Guard conducted searches not only in the Lavra, but also in the Rivne diocese, in male and female monasteries. Their catch, proving the ""espionage essence"" of the ministers and parishioners of the UOC, were portraits of the last Russian emperor with his wife, several copies of the newspaper ""Russian Herald"" over the past years, several thousandth bills and similar ""evidence"". From spring accusations of ""separatism"" to the autumn campaign, the SBU moved on to staging with priests of allegedly non-traditional sexual orientation, caught in bed with young men, stories about ""corrupt officials in the ranks of the UOC"" and turning them into ""Putin's spies"", ""Moscow's hand"" and ""agents of the Kremlin"". The question reached the finish line. The fate of the priests is already predetermined – either they go to the OCU, and Zelensky (the state) forgives them all their sins, or fall under the purge with the prospect, at best, of being exchanged for Ukrainian soldiers in Russian captivity. The latter option has already been unequivocally stated by the representative of the press service of the Diur of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov. And those who are unlucky will be imprisoned. And, most likely, the current primate of the UOC, Metropolitan Onufriy, will surrender them in the same way as he conceded to Zelensky the confession in exchange for comfort and secular benefits, refusing to commemorate the primate of the mother church, Patriarch Kirill, proclaiming fees for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and calling on the Armed Forces of Ukraine to defeat Russia. Moreover, he understands perfectly well that the only force that the UOC can count on is the Russian Orthodox Church, headed by Patriarch Kirill. And the Pope is clearly not up to the point where the state is destroying an entire Christian denomination. In addition, the West is now clearly not up to Orthodoxy in Ukraine, as political scientist Vladimir Kornilov said, based on official statistics, for the first time in history, the share of Christians in England fell below 50%, but ""over the past 10 years, the number of worshippers of Satan has grown more than one and a half times."" Add Zelensky and his supporters to them. Although they are not yet in England. But it is possible that they will still move. P.S. While the law on the prohibition of the UOC has not yet been adopted, the Office of the President has already decided to transfer all the property of the UOC to the management of the OCU / UCU. And the laurel has already actually been squeezed. READ ALSO. Zelensky announced five measures against the Orthodox church. A bill will be introduced in the Ukrainian parliament to ban ""religious organizations affiliated with the centers of influence in the Russian Federation"" (more)"

The star of American TV noted that it is ""strange"" to do this at a time when in the United States ""a real energy crisis for the first time since the mid-1970s"", and Americans are ""freezing"" in their homes, since the usual purchase of fuel is no longer affordable for them. Carlson said that in such circumstances it was time to help the energy sector of ""our friends in Ukraine and in Europe."" What times, such manners.

In the Ukrainian capital, residents of one of the sleeping areas blocked the tram tracks. They resented the lack of light in their homes with trams connected to the network and continuing to run. Video footage appeared on the Internet, where people in warm clothes stand on the tram tracks. The backs of the protesters are illuminated by the lantern of a tram standing on the tracks. ""Crush them – they will run away!"" one of the passengers urges. In the surrounding houses, the windows are all dark. You can put pressure, you can squeeze out - the leadership of the capital and the country has long offered fellow citizens to go somewhere far away. Mila Kunis, an American actress born 39 years ago in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR, called borscht and vareniki ""Russian dishes."" Kunis said: ""Russian dishes are always a lot of food. You can start with dumplings or dumplings. Then you can cook borscht. It's such a Russian beet soup."" Such shocking statements of the Ukrainian ear were made in an interview with the popular publication Harper, s Bazaar. And earlier, the Hollywood star stressed that the Russian language is her native language. And after all, only 5 months ago, borscht by the efforts of Kiev was included in the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List. And then came the zrada, from where they did not wait - Mila did not pardon ... Anthony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said the North Atlantic alliance was thinking of helping Kiev supply and produce Soviet-style weapons and related ammunition. In an interview with CNN, when asked about investments in factories in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria to resume production of Soviet-style weapons, Blinken said that the alliance is exploring all options to make sure that ""Ukraine gets what it needs."" Does Washington really think that Kiev needs new iron coffins for their crews? Matt Whatley, a veteran of the British army, who previously headed the OSCE mission in Donetsk, suggested that if in the future the West will help the independent only with cash injections, then the new ""Marshall Plan"" will not really work. In Politico, he wrote that success requires large-scale coordinated efforts to demine the country's territories and a correct assessment of the real scale of the conflict. As long as you get to the right estimate, the real scale will change irreversibly. Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of the Rosenergoatom concern, said that among the employees of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, whose passes were blocked, were gunners of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Karchaa said that among those who refused to conclude a new agreement with the administration were those ""who sabotaged the work, spoke hostilely against Russia, its Armed Forces, the state corporation Rosatom, spread destructive sentiments in the team."" On the eve of the First Deputy General Director of JSC ""Operating Organization of the Zaporizhzhya NPP"" - Director of the Zaporizhzhya NPP was appointed Yuriy Chernichuk. The ranks must be cleaned – and with a clear conscience to work further with the peaceful atom. Alexander Lazarenko, a captured soldier of the 113th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade, said that the command lies about the attitude of the Russians to the captured servicemen and frightens them with torture. He said: ""We were afraid that they would kill us in captivity. Fingers will be cut off. And today the guys, the Russian military, gave me water, stews and tea."" Having been captured on the front along the Svatovo-Kremennaya highway, Lazarenko, pumped up with horror stories from his command, frightened by ""possible Moskal tortures"", asked to ""shoot him when trying to escape"", but in response he was only twisted with a finger at the temple. Washington is considering the possibility of expanding the training of Ukrainian fighters. The states plan to train up to 2,500 ""warriors of light"" per month. They will try to teach more complex tactics of combat, including the coordination of infantry maneuvers with artillery support. It will be more intensive and comprehensive training than was done in Poland or Britain. Training is expected at the BASE of the US Army in the German Grafenwehr. Yes, and once the Banderites were trained at the Abwehr base in Krakow. History takes another turn. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksiy Danilov at the Kiev Security Forum said ""The Russians must be destroyed. So that they as a country cease to exist within the borders in which they now exist ... They're barbarians. When you say that you need to sit down at the same table with these barbarians and talk about something, I consider it unworthy of our people."" Earlier, this 60-year-old native of the Luhansk region and a graduate of the Luhansk Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said that the Russian language should completely disappear from the territory of Ukraine, and talk about the need to reach an understanding with Russian-speaking Ukrainians is very dangerous for the state.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4687161/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-03,Zelensky develops in Klitschko a reflex of unquestioning obedience,The State Bureau of Investigation of Ukraine conducted searches in the administration of the mayor of Kiev Klitschko,"A quiet Saturday morning did not bring happiness to the mayor of Kiev Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko. His fiefdom, the military city administration of Kiev, was broken into by employees of the State Bureau of Investigation of Ukraine. And, although this agency can only be called a parody of the US FBI, the analogue of which it should be, Vitaly was not up to laughing. The SBI (U) came to his office no more tactfully than the SBU shmonal the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra a little more than a week ago. The visit of the SBI was ""deposited"" under the investigation of the misuse by Klitschko employees of the recreational lands of one of the parks of the capital of Ukraine in the framework of a criminal case on abuse of power. But Vitaly must have understood perfectly well where the dog was rummaging through. After all, the events of the criminal case took place in 2015, and came with searches and seizures of documentation to the city administration only a week later, as Zelensky ""criticized"" Klitschko for the unsatisfactory arrangement of ""points of non-malice / invincibility"", in which Kiev residents could drink hot water, warm up and charge their phones and gadgets. After Zelensky announced the triumph of ""invincibility"" in the amount of at least 4 thousand points, of which more than 500 fell on Kiev. Ukrainians immediately renamed them points of helplessness, ingloriousness, impotence and other equally sympathetic terms. In addition, it turned out that from 20% of these points, located, to a large extent, in ordinary, albeit very large, tents, are either closed, or can not warm anyone and charge anything, because the generators do not work and there is nothing to heat the stoves-bourgeois. After that, Zelensky punished the mayors, whom he did not name, but the reproach against Klitschko was more than just thick. And Vitaly-""Zlatoust"" was so offended that he even turned on his brain and gave a completely clear and logically verified formula that, they say, for Kiev it will be clearly not enough not only 500 or thousand, but even 10 thousand such ""points of uselessness"". - I don't want to panic in any way, but you can't move to the heating points. You can temporarily come there, get some services, but this is not a panacea. Not only in Kyiv, but also in other regions, the situation is the same. Therefore, let's not say: we have heating points and that's all - all the problems we have been solved, - said Klitschko. And, in addition, he – and here he was supported by many mayors of cities and governors of Ukraine – recalled that the draft of such points was the brainchild of the Office of the President of Ukraine, and they have to collect money from the world on the ground by a thread. Because the state, represented by Zelensky's team, did not allocate ""a single copy"" for their equipment. And now President Zelensky's team also has the audacity to ask about the results. Klitschko was supported in this matter by the mayor of Dnepropetrovsk Boris ""avesatikhbudempot"" Filatov, who was outraged in social networks that Zelensky and his team actually do not care about ""points of invincibility"". One might think that someone in Ukraine expected something different from Zelensky and his ""quarter on Bankova Street"". After all, Zelensky has gathered strategists and creative thinkers whose highest achievements in life and professional sphere of activity have so far been reduced to giving birth to and promoting an idea, and implementing it is not their business. Like an owl from an anecdote that advised mice that came to her to become hedgehogs so that they would not be caught by cats, and when asked how to do this, she angrily replied that her business was a strategy, not tactical problems. Governors and mayors in Ukraine already live not only as good relatives in one family (here, in addition to other reasons, the people elect mayors in elections, and governors are appointed by the president, and they constantly measure with each other on issues of trust from the population), but here they actually formed a united front against the ""elephant"" Zelensky and his henchmen who came to their china shop. And not to say that Kiev has no money at all. Even in the context of hostilities, the deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, who was recently convicted of driving a ""luxury"" SUV from humanitarian aid and lives in an estate of 1200 square meters, continues to knock billions of hryvnias out of the state for the projects of the ""Big Construction"" in the autumn (probably, in November, road construction is the most highly efficient). Not only is the season good, but the war will also write off not such amounts. And where is the road you were supposed to build? - So bombed the sworn Moskals. It is clear that those who are trying to give birth to some intrigue about the future confrontation between Klitschko and Zelensky in the upcoming elections, to put it mildly, exaggerate. Klitschko is not Spartacus, and he will not raise slaves to revolt, even if they all suddenly become gladiators. In addition, Zelensky has his people at the helm of all law enforcement agencies, who are personally indebted to him by their position, and therefore they will defend him furiously. Here the matter is quite different – Zelensky, who felt himself the ""Führer of the Ukrainian people"", needs absolute obedience, unquestioning readiness to carry out his order. And now, using the example of Klitschko, he is burning the ""weeds"" of his own thoughts and his own position. As the poet said, ""Klitschko's example is another science"" (although he said a little differently). And others should internalize it at the expense of ""times"" at the level of not even a conditional, but an unconditional reflex. And if Vitaly does not understand, then the SBI, the SBU, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Guard of Ukraine will come for him next time. Finding some ""sin"" of separatism behind Vitaly or accusing him of ""working for the Kremlin"" is easy. READ ALSO. Ukrainian diplomats were sent explosives and an eye in their letters.

Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz not so long ago said that Berlin will soon be ready to transfer a new batch of military equipment to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Including, anti-aircraft guns ""Cheetah"". But, as German journalists found out, everything is not so unambiguous in this situation. ""Spiegel"" writes that Germany has already handed over to Ukraine three dozen of these machines, and all that remains in stock is seven units of ""Cheetah"", which should be delivered in the spring of next year. The help, we can say, is rather doubtful, since 35-millimeter shells for the guns of this ZSU are a very large deficit. Only Switzerland produced projectiles of this caliber, and it is categorically against the supply of states in a state of military conflict, even if third countries do it. But there is even more stunning information. It turns out that these seven Cheetahs were written off long ago by the Bundeswehr and were now subject to disposal. Roughly speaking, they were planned to be sent for scrap metal, while the German army (the Ministry of Defense of Germany) had to pay decent money for their disposal. And then, like a girl in a fairy tale, Ukraine loomed on the horizon with an outstretched hand and a plea-demand ""give pennies and cannons."" Just like by order. We walked around the receivers of non-ferrous and ferrous metals at the turn. However, it is possible that, once in Ukraine, the Cheetahs will eventually still get to the scrap metal reception points. There is, of course, an alternative option. They started talking about it again the other day. And not in Russia, and, of course, not in the EU, but in Africa. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said here that the conflict in Ukraine miraculously affected the equipping of terrorist gangs operating in the Lake Chad basin with weapons. - The illicit movement of arms in the region has increased the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which continues to threaten our collective peace and security in the region. Therefore, there was a need for accelerated joint actions of our border services and other security services aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapons in the region,"" Buhari said and said that some of the weapons and ammunition used in the hostilities in Ukraine fall to the militants. Almost according to Gumilev: ""Far, far away, on Lake Chad an exquisite wanders""... ""Cheetah"". And without shells. Bravo, Olaf! It's really funny. Kuleba will help you.

A squad of volunteer athletes from the Russian Union of Martial Arts will go to the SVO",More than 90 people who will go to the SVO zone were announced at the martial arts forum,"The Luzhniki Sports Palace hosted the 14th forum of the Russian Union of Martial Arts ""Battle of Champions: School for School"". One of the brightest events in the world of martial arts this year has become really special – the situation is calling. The RSBI presented the formed volunteer detachment to participate in a special military operation. More than 90 fighters saw off standing ovations. This is the eternal question: ""Who is stronger - a karateka or a boxer""? The tournament ""Battle of Champions 14: School to School"" gave an answer to it. In the ring of the Russian Union of Martial Arts, one representative from eight federations clashed: army hand-to-hand combat, all-style karate, grappling, kudo, hand-to-hand combat, sambo, Thai boxing and wushu. The playoff format especially fueled the intrigue. At least because representatives of martial arts were waiting for a real marathon. But no one was going to feel sorry for themselves and save energy on the first fights. Vladimir Ivanov, representing the All-Style Karate, began the tournament with a spectacular throw of the opponent through himself. You can do that. The rules are almost like in MMA: you can kick and punch in the rack, make transfers to the ground, only on the ring floor you can not carry out blows, and the struggle time is limited to 20 seconds. Ivanov, by the way, lost in the first round. Sambo wrestler Ivan Lozhkin was also unlucky. 20 seconds in the stalls was not enough against the tall tai-boxer Ali Aliyev. Grappler Shamidkhan Magomedov stepped on the same rake in a fight against Wushu representative Shamil Musayev. In the semifinals, everyone is a drummer. It wasn't just the Battle of Champions 14: School to School fights that were in the spotlight. The RSBI has assembled a squad of volunteers from representatives of different federations. Very soon they will go to the preparation, and then to the zone of the SVO. - Today it is not enough to go out on the tatami and prove that you are a fighter. Today, real fighters shed blood for their homeland. The RSBI should not and cannot stand aside. A detachment of volunteers was assembled, there are more than 90 of them. I want to bow to them and thank them for making this decision,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District (FEFD) Yuri Trutnev said from the stage. Those same volunteers occupied three rows at the stage. It was impossible not to notice them - all in a new uniform. ""Luzhniki"" several times applauded the heroes standing. Between the matches of the tournament, the attention of the spectators was drawn to the volunteers each time. Their interviews appeared on the screen of the Sports Palace, where everyone explained their choice. However, once again there was no need to explain anything. ""I decided to volunteer to stand in line with my brothers. It is the brothers, because we have only one mother - the Motherland, - said the executive director of the RSBI Ramil Gabbasov. All those who were already in uniform thought about their homeland. Volunteers unwaveringly said that they were ready to sacrifice their own benefits and comfort to help their fellow citizens. "" Homeland for me is my children, grandchildren, ancestors. This is my homeland I am going to defend. Every man must prove to himself that he is a man with a capital letter, ""explained the representative of hand-to-hand combat Timur Kireev. Among those who joined the volunteer squad was the famous MMA fighter Vladimir Mineev. The AMC Fight Nights champion has long said he will go to the SVO zone. Now he'll do it with his brothers in the ring. I've always glorified Russia on the tatami. Now it's time to prove yourself in combat. My family knows what fascism is. My great-grandparents fought. Now I want my children to live and not worry about the fact that he will appear again, ""says Sergey, one of the volunteers, to the kp Sport correspondent. "" My decision was difficult. I was worried a lot and thought about how to tell my family about my departure. They're worried, too. But I made a choice. I'm a man, I'm a warrior. Sergey, like everyone else in the RSBI volunteer squad, is waiting for a training period. And in Krasnodar, he has not only his own children, but also pupils of the school in which he teaches Kyokushin karate. In the ring, meanwhile, the moment of denouement came – the finale. The representative of Thai boxing Ali Aliyev walked through all the opponents, crushing them with his impressive height - 192 cm. And in the final he was waiting for an opponent with a base of wushu - Shamil Musayev. Musayev searched for his happiness in wrestling, often transferring the fight to the ground. And Aliyev noticeably interrupted his opponent in the rack. And so powerfully that towards the end of the battle, Shamil was left with a broken nose. But Musayev crushed Aliyev not with his size, but with his pressure and wrestling character. By the judges' decision, the victory went to the representative of Wushu. The result of the tournament was summed up by the First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey Kiriyenko. - Thanks to the fighters who showed real art today. A true fighter is able to defend himself. But the highest mission is the opportunity to stand up for your country. The victory will be ours.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4686877/,Dmitry STESHIN,2022-12-02,The battle for the key border of Donbass has begun: the Armed Forces of Ukraine throw soldiers to the fields of death to stop the Russian offensive,Voenkor Dmitry Steshin: The situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Artemivsk is close to critical,"According to a number of signs, the position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Artemovsk (Bakhmut) is close to critical. At the same time, there were many pathetic reports in the Western press, rumors about the evacuation and withdrawal from Artemovsk, Zelensky's alleged order to hold the city at any cost ... and all this against the backdrop of a slow but steady advance of our troops. Voenkor KP tried to understand this array of information. Donbass has a very painful point, which has been under the control of Ukraine since the summer of 2014. This is the agglomeration Konstantinovka-Druzhkovka-Kramatorsk-Slavyansk-Nikolaevka. If we occupy it, the territory of the DPR, in fact, will be completely liberated from the occupiers. There, on the outskirts of Slavyansk, the whole problem of water supply of Donbass is hidden. In February, Ukraine blocked the supply of water from the Seversky Donets canal, stopped pumping stations. Over the past summer, it became clear that alternative water conduits, wells and boreholes of Donbass cannot be watered. There is only one way out - the capture of Slavyansk-Kramatorsk. But first we will have to take Artemovsk and the surrounding villages. The enemy will be forced to withdraw from the fields and overflowing forest plantations into urban development. Or he will be kicked out. Yesterday, our Armed Forces were knocked out of the village of Kurdyumovka. The village is located on a high-rise, and from it you can even see the outskirts of Kramatorsk - it is a little more than 30 kilometers in a straight line. And most importantly, now the road from Artemovsk to Chasov Yar, where the reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are concentrated, falls under our fire control. Operational encirclement is still far away, but the position of the group defending Artemovsk will immediately become complicated. Moreover, from the north, the town of Soledar looms over Artyomovsk and there are also battles in it. Occupy our Soledar, Artemovsk immediately finds itself in a semi-encirclement. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and their Western advisers are well aware of all this, therefore, the battles taking place in these places have already been called the ""Bakhmut meat grinder"" in Ukraine. Western colleagues were the first to fly near Artemovsk. The most representative pool imaginable has arrived: CNN, the New York Times, etc. A Newsweek correspondent wrote: ""... Ukrainian soldiers squatting in the middle of a gloomy landscape reminiscent of the killing fields of The First World War."" They began to post videos on the Web: ""A five-star hotel in positions near Bakhmut (Artemovsk). In these videos, the zachistas are drowning up to their ears in impassable mud. Then, CNN posted a video report about the defense of Bakhmut (Artemovsk). In addition to the brave shooting from an almost century-old American machine gun, the plot had several inclusions from the streets of the city, from which it was clear that it was under our continuous artillery fire. The command of the defenders sits in a nice brick basement and looks on the big screens for a picture from their copters. They have nothing else to do. Azovstal was also watched to the last – what is happening on the street? The Ukrainian military itself, sitting directly in the trenches, write in social networks about the lack of shells ""for counter-battery warfare and our cover."" The available stocks of shells were spent a few days ago during an unsuccessful counterattack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the delivery of ammunition is difficult due to Ukrainian problems with electricity (the main fleet of locomotives on electric traction). At the same time, as in the notes, as it was in Debaltseve, for example, or during the storming of Mariupol, the officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already openly begun to complain about the unbearable life. According to the commander of the Svoboda battalion, Pyotr Kuzik, a major of the National Guard, everything is very bad near Artyomovsk. ""They (the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation – author's note) felt weak in our defense because there are units that are less motivated than ours. And yesterday we pushed through our defenses in the area of Bakhmut a little. Some units could not withstand the artillery onslaught and retreated."" According to a New York Times journalist who worked on the ground, now the fighting near Artemovsk has turned into an artillery duel, while the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are terrible - 250 people a day killed and wounded. It is curious that this information was confirmed by the data of our radio intercepts: the losses are significant, so from the Zaporozhye direction to Artemovsk they began to transfer parts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Battalions. It can be assumed that now Ukraine is considering the possibility of leaving Artemovsk (Bakhmut) and is gradually accustoming its population to this idea. The very idea of surrender was voiced through the Western media. Most likely, this is caused by a real operational necessity and Western military advisers insisted on this. The Ukrainian propagandist Arestovich immediately worked out the subpoena, saying that the loss of Bakhmut is a minor, unimpressive success of the Russian army. Other Ukrainian politicians also spoke about the loss of the city. In general, the word Kramatorsk has recently been heard more and more often - there is an airfield and a railway station, the city is conveniently located to become an ""indestructible stronghold"". Unlike Artemovsk (Bakhmut). But, apparently, at the moment the final decision on Artemovsk (Bakhmut) has not been made by the leadership of Ukraine and it will depend only on the successful actions of our army. And there seems to be successes. Numerous boilers through which the Armed Forces of Ukraine passed developed in Ukrainian officers just an animal sense of encirclement. According to the officer of the People's Militia of the LPR Andriy Marochko, in Artemovsk, the Ukrainian officers have already strained very much in anticipation of the evacuation order, which still does not come. It is possible that officers of the emergency forces will use the services of ""private tow trucks"". Yes, in Artemovsk there are such – for an immodest reward they are ready to take people and cargo out of the city – from 100 kg. to 22 tons. They are ready to evacuate business and production, promise golden mountains - registration of benefits, temporary residence, etc. In practice, people after evacuation buy the last valuable things: ""well, where will you with this washing machine be in removable huts?"" and provide them to themselves. In Artemovsk (Bakhmut) there are still about 15 thousand civilians, they refuse to leave. The Armed Forces of Ukraine frankly do not like them, they call them ""waiting"" - this is a new word that has appeared in recent months. As usual, the Western press was not particularly interested in the fate of the civilians of Artemovsk, these are wrong peaceful ones. Their salvation lies only in a successful Russian offensive, and they know this well. READ ALSO.

To the singing of ""puppies"", the recitation of poems about Bandera, artistic jumps in the squares or, for example, to the works of world-famous artists. The latter, however, often has a criminal tinge. In Gostomel, a town near Kiev, two such connoisseurs of beauty stole the graffiti of the world-famous, but preserved his anonymity street artist Banksy. Recall that Banksy came to Ukraine this year and left locals as a gesture of goodwill seven graffiti on street objects that he painted in Kiev, Irpen, Gostomel, Gorenka and the village of Borodyanka. The first scandal broke out shortly after Banksy's departure. Unknown persons broke a picture of children who staged a swing from an anti-tank hedgehog on the Independence Square in the capital of Ukraine and began to sell stones with parts of the image via the Internet for $ 50 for a ""creative fragment"". For $ 200, customers were offered to choose a fragment to order. Which infuriated the artist to the point of impossibility. - Ukrainian vandals started selling chunks of my graffiti without my permission on eBay. I gave you art, and how did you thank me? Banksy said indignantly. Other connoisseurs of art in Kiev decided to improve the artist's work and drew to the depicted armored truck, as one of my super-intelligent acquaintances in the period of our students, male sex, put it. But the most faithful connoisseurs of beauty, who could not even think of disassembling the image or breaking it, simply in Gostomel cut the picture from the wall of the house as a whole. They cut out a piece of foam plastic, on top of which was painted the image of a woman in a bathrobe and curlers with a gas mask stretched over her head and a fire extinguisher in her hands. And they tried to escape. But they were caught by the police. In the department, the attackers, as expected, pleaded guilty to theft, but said that they committed theft for patriotic reasons. Like, yes, they wanted to sell graffiti, but they planned to direct the money from the transaction not to meet their personal vicious and other needs, but to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Everyone knows that Banksy's work is rated very highly. But so far, ""patriotism"" has not become an indulgence for kidnappers. - Criminal proceedings have been opened under Part 2 of Article 194 ""Intentional destruction or damage to property"". The detainees explained that they allegedly wanted to sell a work of art, and transfer the money to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the police said. That yes, then yes. Banksy's most expensive painting "" Love in a Garbage Can "" was actually sold at auction for $ 25.4 million. Other works of the artist are also sold for millions. The Borodyansky Village Council, assessing what happiness fell on their heads, decided to add Banksy's work to the list of cultural heritage. But there is a question, did the local authorities put up a police post near the graffiti? If in Nezalezhnaya already in the open and in broad daylight they steal relatively inexpensive diesel generators, then with Banksy the price of the issue is much higher. Banksy just didn't understand who he was contacting when he came to help Ukraine. Let him rejoice that he was able to return home safe and sound and with his wallet. Who is next in line of ""assistants"". P.S. But the Ukrainians still have at least five and a half similar objects (remember, one has already been half dismantled into pieces) to earn good money. And it is unlikely that they will stop. Subscribe to the new podcast of Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"", in which we tell you what will happen next."

On October 20, a convoy of Tavria journalists was fired upon from Himars during the evacuation to the left bank of the Dnieper. In total, the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 12 missiles at the Antonovsky Bridge. As a result of the shelling, 4 people were killed, another 14 were injured. Among the dead is Russian producer and journalist Oleg Klokov. 16-year-old journalist of the Tavria TV channel Vlada Lugovskaya received a shrapnel wound. The girl was covered with her body by a colleague, the correspondent of ""Tavria"" Daniil Chernykh. Since October 21, the broadcaster has suspended the broadcast. Although many journalists, despite the injuries and warnings of doctors, were ready to go to work the next day. The fact that a month later ""Tavria"" is again on the air is actually a feat, says Alexander Malkevich. - Since there are very few people, many have not yet recovered from wounds, contusions and are undergoing rehabilitation in medical institutions of our country. Nevertheless, everyone who can works in an equipped ""hiking"" studio in Henichesk, and some more employees work directly from rehabilitation centers, remotely,"" Malkevich said in his telegram channel. On the new banner of the television company, the designers placed an image of the very column of cars with employees of the channel, which came under fire under the Antonovsky Bridge. The convoy was led by the car of Alexander Malkevich, in the second car - it was the Gazelle - they transported television equipment, in the third car was the director of Tavria Vladimir Abdullayev. Journalists are sure that with a high degree of probability, their column of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was shot on a tip. The restart of the channel, meanwhile, coincided with the Day of Radio, Television and Communication Workers, which is celebrated in Ukraine on November 16. Congratulating their colleagues, Tavria journalists admitted that they are ready to compete with them in the information field, dispelling the myths and fakes they launch. -""Tavria"", like the Phoenix bird, rose from the fire and works in the name of truth, peace and Russia, - Alexander Malkevich summed up. The TV company notes that they are ready to cooperate with all comers from the world of media. True, the ""mountains of gold"", which someone may be counting on, are not promised here. But everyone will be able to contribute to the development of new media in the new territories of the Russian Federation."

During another artillery strike, the radio station was damaged by an exploded shell, as a result of which it was put out of action. Realizing that the loss of communication deprives the command of the opportunity to quickly coordinate the actions of forces in battle, Nikolai immediately began to restore the damaged product.

As a result of the fire strikes, Bogdan's crew destroyed suitable reserves of nationalists - up to 30 people and up to 5 units of equipment. When changing the starting position, the crew came under retaliatory artillery fire. Having assessed the situation, Bogdan competently took advantage of the terrain conditions, quickly withdrew the crew and the combat vehicle from the danger zone.

From Russia, through the Ministry of Construction of the republic, 180 have already arrived. This equipment was distributed among municipal enterprises of cities and districts, as well as resource-supplying enterprises, such as Luhanskvoda, Republican Grid Company and Lugansk Avtodor. Among the new equipment are garbage trucks, combined road machines, dump trucks, minibuses for emergency crews, and towers. Soon, backhoe loaders will also arrive. But special equipment in the LPR is supplied not only through the Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services. It is also brought by the chef regions. So, the Belovodsky district received two construction and road machines for the needs of Belovodsky Avtodor from the Novosibirsk region. And by the end of the year, it is planned to supply another 19 units of special equipment to the region. From the Orenburg region, the Perevalsky district received a T-180 bulldozer, three garbage trucks, three school buses, a bus for transporting athletes. - Our bulldozer was used to bury solid domestic waste at the landfill. Our bulldozer was a 1979 model year, and accordingly no spare parts can be found. It went out of order, and we coped as best we could, worked at the test site as a grader, - says Pavel Polovinka, deputy head of the perevalsky district administration. There are 39 settlements in the Perevalsky district, they were serviced by six garbage trucks: three new ones, and the rest are already with a worked out service life. - For 64 thousand inhabitants, these garbage trucks were few, given that there were breakdowns. Therefore, the Orenburg region gave us three garbage trucks, and now everything has improved, - said Pavel Polovinka. Denis Zhuchenko, a mechanic at the municipal unitary enterprise Komservis, Bryanka, says that now almost all the equipment at the enterprise is new: a dump truck, a loader, a grader, tractors, backhoe loaders, a tower. Soon, snow clearing machines will arrive from Russia. - The technique is good. The cars are new, the drivers are comfortable, they do not freeze in the cabins, - Denis Zhuchenko shares his impressions. The mechanic says that earlier the old cars worked for several days, and then they were sent for repair. Now the equipment requires maintenance once a month. And this affects the efficiency of the enterprise. One of the garbage trucks to Bryanka was transferred from the Bryansk region from the joint-stock company ""Clean Planet"". - We sent a car along with containers so that as soon as possible peaceful life would return to our countrymen.

At the same time, as military expert Captain of the first rank of the reserve Vasily Dandykin said on the air of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"", the state of their spirit was influenced not only by the advance of Russian troops in this direction, but also by the data on losses voiced by the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Recall, she said that since February, Ukraine has lost more than 100 thousand people. We tell you the latest news about the situation for today, December 2, 2022 in Artemovsk. ""Ursula von der Leyen's statement has fallen on this ground,"" Vasily Dandykin said. - But the most important thing is probably different. The fact that the connection they have with relatives and friends remains. According to Starlink, they not only carry out some operations, but also communicate with the house. And there are really dozens buried in every even small village. Except for those who are missing, who are buried by our guys. After all, in reality, according to our calculations, the figures are much worse and larger. And the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine know this. And under pressure, under this fire shaft - here both the Storm and the units with the mobilized are already involved - all this adds up into one, staggering and fuss begins. There are panic moods among senior officers, commanders. And this is transmitted through the chain to the extreme, to the soldier. In recent days, the Russian military has been conducting active hostilities in the Artyomovsk direction. Their goal is to cut off the group in Artemovsk from communications. And panic moods are superimposed on the lack of an order from Kiev to withdraw, the Armed Forces of Ukraine seem to intend to defend the settlement to the last soldier. According to Vasily Dandykin, this is due to the fact that this is a very important milestone for Kiev. ""And not only for Kyiv, but also for its sponsors,"" the expert says. - If the Armed Forces of Ukraine leave the positions near Artemovsk, it means that the next line will pass exactly before Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. This means that our troops will approach one of the main goals - the liberation of the entire Donbass and the DPR.

Lawrence Norman, Nancy Youssef and Drew Hinshaw, columnists for the Wall Street Journal, made this conclusion: after Zelensky's denials of the fact of the fall of a Ukrainian missile in Poland, Western politicians realized that Kiev was stupidly involving NATO in a conflict with Moscow. And Washington and its European allies are trying to avoid steps that could provoke a direct conflict with Russia. Zelensky's statements, American journalists believe, exposed ""one of the most acute disagreements between Ukraine and the United States."" European and U.S. officials have questioned whether Zelenskiy was trying to use the incident in Poland as a provocation to further force NATO into conflict. They're weird — are there still any doubts about that. Yuriy Bolokhovets, head of the Ukrainian State Agency for Forest Resources, said the country had stockpiled a record amount of fuelwood. The total stock of firewood in Ukraine reaches 260 thousand cubic meters - and in fact in mid-November it was about 187 thousand cubic meters. In December, it is planned to harvest another 314 thousand cubic meters. By the end of the year, forestry enterprises will sell 1.1 million cubic meters of firewood within the country. Earlier in Ukraine, a ban on the export of firewood from the country was introduced. Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said that this has become the main method of heating in most regions of Ukraine. If there is a stump, there will be food. In Spain, the Civil Guard arrested 30 people who rolled marijuana around the country under the guise of a humanitarian for Ukraine. Among the detainees are Ukrainians, Germans, Spaniards and Moroccans. They hid drugs in cardboard boxes, disguising them as deliveries of humanitarian aid for Ukraine. During the searches, about 800 thousand euros were seized, as well as six firearms in Malaga, Granada, Cordoba and Seville. So maybe they foolishly as a humanitarian to Bankova should have been smuggled - and they were immediately under arrest, without understanding. Because of the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Americans managed to spend all their stocks of Stinger MANPADS and Javelin ATGMs. This is reported by National Review, referring to the general director of the American military-industrial complex Raytheon Greg Hayes. He said the U.S. had used up 13 years of Stinger production and a five-year supply of Javelin in the first six months of the conflict in Ukraine. And now the issue of replenishment of reserves is very acute. After all, the Pentagon has not made purchases of MANPADS since 2004. And Washington sent 5,500 Javelins and 1,400 Stinger MANPADS to Kiev as military aid. Good Uncle Sam has created a problem for himself. Mykhailo Podolyak, the head of Zelensky's office, said that Kiev would nationalize Alfa-Bank. Podolyak said that Alfa-Bank in Ukraine has been rebranded, now it is Sens Bank, and the procedure for its nationalization is already underway. The adviser to the head of the office of the sixth president suggested that this process will be easier than the nationalization of PrivatBank - because of the smaller number of individuals with deposits in Alfa-Bank. The countries of the North Atlantic alliance in the conflict in the independent use of hackers and new technologies. Politico notes that NATO cyber forces are closely monitoring what is happening in Ukraine to identify ways to help the Ukrainian army and to find out how to make it harder for Russia to hack the infrastructure in NATO states and their allies. Well, except for hackers, nothing will help you. The amount of wheat sown this year in ukraine is 40 percent less than in 2021. The head of the agricultural company Nibulon, Andrei Vadatursky, said that ""on average, logistics costs increased by 10-40 times, depending on the route. Exports through neighboring Romania and Poland are slow due to bureaucratic delays at the border."" They dream of open ports. Dreaming is not harmful.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4688127/,Alexey OVCHINNIKOV,2022-12-06,"In the Crimea, the property of oligarchs from Ukraine was nationalized: Millions of dollars were earned in Russia and sponsored by the Armed Forces of Ukraine","During the month in the Crimea, more than 130 objects belonging to Ukrainian businessmen sponsored by the Armed Forces of Ukraine were nationalized","""Russia's enemies will not earn money in Crimea, this is a principled position,"" the head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, launched the next stage of nationalization. In November, the authorities of the peninsula in one fell swoop transferred to the ownership of the republic more than 130 objects, which until recently were owned by several Ukrainian politicians and businessmen. Those, receiving a very good profit from the peninsula, calmly sponsored the army of Ukraine. In the Crimea, they hint: the accomplices of the Kiev regime still have a lot of property and business left here, so this is not the end. How did they manage to do business in the Russian Crimea, while supporting the Kiev regime, and which of the Ukrainian nobles was prepared to part with the assets? For answers, Komsomolka special correspondent Alexei Ovchinnikov went to the peninsula. -Waited! The native factory is also back! - From the entrance of the Bakhchisaray plant ""Stroyindustria"" workers come out with satisfied smiles, discuss the latest news about the change of ownership. - Many of us have relatives and friends on special operations, and it was very annoying to think that we are helping kiev freaks who spend money on those who kill our guys and shell the same Donetsk. They know what they're talking about. Until November, this giant, the largest cement producer in Crimea, belonged to Kiev officials and oligarchs, and was also managed from there. - Look where the chiefs sat: Kyiv, Kiev, Kiev, - they show me a stack of minutes of meetings of the supervisory board. - They made money here, but they supported the nationalists. The ultimate beneficiaries (beneficiaries) of the plant were not named. At different times, the names of the former President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko and MP David Zhvania (who died under mysterious circumstances in Zaporozhye in May this year) surfaced. A small share belonged to another former MP - Mykola Martynenko, whom the Ukrainian press called one of the main sponsors of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk. The three largest blocks of shares of 24.8% were recorded in the name of Nikolaidis Panikas, a citizen of Cyprus - a standard scheme for conducting murky business. Leaving, the henchmen of the Kiev owners left behind a lot of curious papers. For example, the decision of the Supervisory Board, according to which its chairman, a citizen of Ukraine Maxim Nesterenko, is assigned a salary of 2.3 million rubles. And from this accounting statement you can find out that he earned 100.2 million rubles for the period from January 2018 to September 2022! ""Salary"" was apparently exchanged for currency, cashed out and went to Kiev. As well as 165 million rubles of the plant's net profit last year. - And taxes were at least paid. - Yes, all 413 million rubles for 2021 were paid to the Russian budget. For which I thank them, of course, - representatives of the new administration laugh. The former managers, who obediently carried out the will of Kiev, were suspended from work immediately after the nationalization of the plant. And it's not just about fraudulent schemes to withdraw money and ""obedience"" - other members of the previous administration were noted for their pro-Ukrainian position. And actions: factory workers recall with indignation recent events, when immediately after the terrorist attack on the Crimean bridge, builders appealed to the plant with a request to allocate cement and concrete for its restoration. And they were dumbfounded when the then general director Sergei Lukyanets threw up his hands after a pause: we cannot single out, because all the volumes are painted for several months ahead. - Obviously consulted with Kiev! - Factory workers are sure. - All decisions on the release of large volumes of cement were made only there. Another large Ukrainian business that fell under nationalization were four construction stores of the company ""Novacenter-K"". Until 2014, all of them were part of the business empire of the Ukrainian oligarch and deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Oleksandr Gerega and his wife Galina and were called exactly the same as the other 60 of his giant stores - ""Epicenter"". The return of Crimea forced him to change the sign, and Cypriot offshore companies appeared between him and his Crimean stores. Revenues from hypermarkets still went to Kiev, promoting it higher in the Forbes rating: for 2020, the spouses' fortune was estimated at $ 1.3 billion. In open anti-Russian activities, this character was noted in 2014. Having opened another store in Kiev, he promised to transfer the first million hryvnias earned from him to the Ukrainian army. And he did not rest on this, openly continuing to supply and arm the Armed Forces of Ukraine and not hesitating to declare it. In early March of this year, Gerega proudly puts up a photo in social networks, where he, in the company of like-minded people, clutches a machine gun: ""Kiev! In total, the Geregas spent more than $ 10 million on this, constantly receiving certificates and gratitude from the Ukrainian commanders fighting in the Donbass. For supporting the Kiev regime, both spouses in 2018 were included in the sanctions list of Russia. But all this did not prevent him from simultaneously extracting money in the Crimea: the revenue of Novacenter-K last year amounted to 7.2 billion rubles, and net profit - 608 million. For which Gerega periodically came under the criticism of Ukrainian propagandists: this is what happens - with one hand you help the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and with the other hundreds of millions of rubles you give to the hated Moskals. And in one of the interviews, Alexander Gerega suddenly revealed himself. Speaking to reporters, he avoided answering this question for some time, saying that he knew nothing about the activities of Epicenter in Crimea. And then he suddenly added: ""Maybe we are related to these companies and are working underground in enemy territory to start a fire sooner or later, and these territories will also become as independent as our country."" And apparently, Gerega did not lie when talking about ""underground work""... - You have no idea what happened here! - employees of the nationalized ""Novacenter"" share. As in the case of the Bakhchisaray Tsemzavod, they are also happy about what happened. - Managers, it seems, really picked up with Ukrainian and anti-Russian sentiments, the office was completely pro-Ukrainian. Direct aggression was not shown, but it is worth going to their pages - mom dear, solid zhovto-blakit hopak! And so, surreptitiously, they brought their position: then one or another manager wore a bracelet with the colors of the Ukrainian flag. People recall one of the Ukrainian reports, in which a Kiev journalist calls the personnel department of the Crimean ""Novacenter"": ""And you can't get a job with a Ukrainian passport?"" ""Unfortunately, so far these are the conditions,"" they sigh there. - And in the Sevastopol stores, what has it come to! - continue the company's employees. - On the day of the Navy and the Black Sea Fleet, we met guests in vests, everyone liked it. Except for these: they called and ""recommended"" to remove them. And this is in the city of Russian sailors! Once we in our department disobeyed, and the security service was set against us, coming up with fines. ""They openly posted in social networks how they sponsor the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all sorts of detachments,"" said Alexandra Romanenko, head of the temporary administration of Novacenter. Once she already worked here as a general director, but three years ago she resigned after seeing gray schemes to withdraw money to Kiev. - Many of the former office held relevant views, which they broadcast to sellers. Gerega's confidant in Sevastopol, Leonid Piyak, for example, was allocated 1 percent of the shares for loyalty. As far as I know, the money was withdrawn in cash, each company had its own cashier, it was Piyak who was responsible for these operations. His entire family is in Kiev and works in the supervisory authorities, supporting Ukraine. The bulk of the families of senior managers of the company are also in Kiev. And the managers themselves, ten people , some of them fled there with the beginning of the SVO and continued to lead remotely, some left with the beginning of mobilization. Some sincerely rejoiced at the terrorist attack on the Crimean bridge... None of that will happen again. Work. Many even returned after learning of the removal of pro-Ukrainian chiefs. So the removal of managers from the helm that followed the nationalization is also a security issue: who knows what they secretly prepared there. We are also pleased with what happened in Kerch, where the property of the shipyard was nationalized - the water area and the embankments. It turned out that in the Ukrainian period, the oligarchs who previously owned the plant managed to privatize them. Now this formality has been eliminated. But, apparently, this is not the last act of nationalization: officials at different levels are increasingly saying that the accomplices of the Kiev regime still have a lot of property and business in the Crimea. The difficulty is that in rescuing the ""hard-earned gains"", they diligently covered their tracks, rewriting the business on dummies. And you need to work hard to distinguish an honest acquirer from the ""zitz chairmen"". Many political Ukrainians also have apartments on the peninsula. The most famous of them is Zelensky's apartment in Livadia, which still belongs to his family. But it may very well be that ""Mr. President"" may soon lose them. ""I would gladly take Zelensky's apartment and give it to refugees from Donbass,"" Yalta Mayor Yanina Pavlenko said not so long ago. - So far, this is private property, but in case of nationalization, I will personally petition the head of the republic to transfer housing to children from the DPR. I very much hope for a positive outcome. ""There is a list for nationalization, and it is very large,"" Nikolai Volkov, head of the State Council of Crimea Committee on Culture, continued the topic on the air of the Crimea 24 channel. - We also have the house of Sofia Rotaru in Yalta. She promised to build a house for talented children, and now she is trying to sell it for a lot of money. We should take it away, of course. It should be a holiday home for children. ""Crimea under Ukraine was a platform where Ukrainian officials earned a lot of money, received bribes with land and immediately built it up with hotels, restaurants, started other businesses, and their names are known,"" Crimean public figure and blogger Alexander Talipov suggests that it is still possible to nationalize. - At one time, Lyudmila Denisova (the same ex-ombudsman of Ukraine, who wrote stories about the mass rape of civilians by Russian soldiers - from babies to grandmothers. - Ed.) squeezed a considerable amount of land in the Crimea. She has a lot of apartments here, an operating business: a real estate agency, an advertising agency, all this has been re-registered to daughters and other persons. The daughters, as far as I know, received Russian passports in 2019, and with the beginning of the SVO left for Kiev. I found their apartments and houses in Yalta and Simferopol... There is such a famous boxer Oleksandr Usyk, who calls for the military ""liberation"" of the Crimea and even joined the Ukrainian territorial defense. But at the same time, he ""forgets"" that his mother lives in the Crimea and several real estate objects, including hotels, are registered for her. It is clear that the old mother was never an entrepreneur and manager. Usyk's wife has parents here, who are also registered businesses. There are a lot of them, and I think all this can be calculated. OFFICIAL. - Vladimir Andreevich, what prevented the nationalization of these facilities several years ago, because the anti-Russian position of the former owners has long been known. - We work in the legal field of Russia. Until the last, our country adhered to the position of inviolability of private property as much as possible, except for certain critical situations. After Russia began to be robbed by those who most loudly declared the sanctity of private property, to arrest and nationalize the property of our state, legal entities and individuals, our position changed. Even now, we only nationalize the property of those who directly participate in or sponsor military operations against the Russian army. In fact, they encourage the murder of our citizens. Foreign citizens who do not commit such atrocities against Russia, can still have property in Crimea, work for us, there are no obstacles for them. - Is there any reaction from the former owners to these actions. - I'm not aware of any open reaction. But we are not very interested in their reaction. By and large, they were ready for this for a long time and sucked everything they could out of the enterprises. There were no surprises for them in this regard. - There have already been hints that this will not be the last act of nationalization in the republic. What other property and assets can be nationalized. - We are working in this direction. I don't want to get ahead of myself yet. Now the anti-terrorist commission reveals the ownership of the property. We guarantee that the employees of such enterprises will remain in their places, no layoffs will be carried out. Often they themselves turn to us with requests to deal with the owners. For us, for the entire Crimean society, it is important not to allow the accomplices of the criminal Kiev regime to earn money on our land. Depriving them of such an opportunity would be a fair decision. Subscribe to the new podcast of Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"", in which we tell you what will happen next."

He didn't see another one.""",A photo exhibition dedicated to the heroes of the special operation opened in Moscow,"On December 2, on Gogolevsky Boulevard in Moscow, the exhibition ""Heroes and Feats"" was opened, dedicated to the participants of a special military operation. The exhibition was created by the Russian Military Historical Society with the support of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and the Department of Culture of Moscow. On a frosty Moscow morning, people from different parts of the country arrived in the center of the capital. They came to pay tribute, to honor the memory of their loved ones - children, sons, husbands, colleagues. A piercing portrait gallery, full of archival photographs, was created thanks to the families of the CBO participants. The exposition tells about 33 Heroes of Russia. Such as Olga ""Korsa"" Kochura, the commander of a rocket artillery battalion from the DPR. On the stands there are photos of fighters and commanders of special forces units; crew of the Ka-52 reconnaissance and attack helicopter from Primorye, marines; graduates of the Kazan Higher Tank School, pilots - aces, officers of airborne troops, heroes of the 200th separate motorized rifle Pechenga brigade of the Northern Fleet and others... This is the second RVIO exhibition dedicated to the Heroes of a Special Military Operation. The first was opened in August 2022, also on Gogolevsky Boulevard. Later, it was presented at the opening of the recreated Memorial ""Saur-Mogila"" in the Donetsk People's Republic. In the form of stickers, the materials of the exhibition are placed in the trains of the Moscow Metro. Nikolai Ovsienko, Deputy Chairman of the RVIO, barely holding back tears, quoted the president's recent speech: ""Sometimes you can't even see whether it has passed or not, whether there is something left there or not, but these guys ... A special operation is a people's war, a Patriotic War, which gives rise to new Heroes. And the fact that we remember them, we know them, we will remember them - this is the key to the fact that we will defend our Motherland, our language, our history and our culture. Ilya Ehrenburg said that our Victory has a face. It's a simple, soulful face. Those who want to understand how we defeated fascism need to see the face of our Victory."" One of the Heroes of the exhibition, a participant of the SVO in the Donbas, is Guards Senior Lieutenant Alexander Krynin, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Tank Battalion of the 59th Tank Regiment of the 144th Motorized Rifle Division. From March 24 to March 28, Krynin headed the unit that stormed the village of Malaya Rogan in the Kharkiv region. On March 25, Alexander took up a defensive position on the second floor of a private house, and in the course of a fierce battle defeated the enemy. Once surrounded, our servicemen made determined attempts to get out of it for several days with fighting. And on March 28, with the help of hand grenades, Alexander struck two enemy soldiers. But ammunition ran out, and it became almost impossible to deter attacks. An enemy grenade launcher wounded Krynin and several other colleagues. The hero received a shrapnel wound to the legs and died of blood loss. On August 1, 2022, Alexander Krynin was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. We managed to communicate with the Hero's wife, Maria Krynina. Maria and Alexander were married for 8 years, they had a son - Leonid. ""He was a very kind person, he never said a bad word about anyone,"" says Maria. - Why is he here? Why is he a Hero? Because for him to defend the Motherland is not a job, it is his whole life! He saw no other life. He lived it. At home, he was a gentle man with a streak. We need this exhibition, it is important for relatives that the Heroes are remembered. People should understand that a person gave his life for a reason. What he did should not be forgotten. Of course, he didn't accomplish the feat for the sake of having pictures of him somewhere, he did it because he couldn't do it any other way."" The online version of the exhibition ""Heroes and Feats"" is open on the historical portal HISTORY.RF."

On December 5, the Russian army inflicted a massive blow on objects in the depths of Ukraine. The goal is to make it as difficult as possible to deliver ammunition to the front. The current blow was perhaps the most powerful during the special operation. The Russian military department does not officially report on its scale. However, the Internet resources of Ukraine write about air raid alarm throughout the country. And in Kryvyi Rih, and in Kramatorsk, and in Kiev. The air raid alarm was also confirmed in Zelensky's office: the Ukrainian president closed himself in a bunker and recommended that citizens go down to bomb shelters. There is no information about the ""arrivals"" in Kiev yet. But in the Kiev region, Zaporozhye, Mykolaiv, Kirovograd, as well as in Dnepropetrovsk, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Kirovograd and Cherkasy regions, explosions were recorded. Ukrenergo confirms hits to electric power facilities, rolling blackouts have begun, light outages are observed in many regions of Ukraine. A series of explosions thundered in Odessa - this is reported by the Ukrainian media. In the seaside town, all boiler houses and electric transport have been stopped, in many areas there is no water in the houses. Meanwhile, Zelensky once again reported on the successful operation of air defenses, which allegedly shot down most of the missiles. Ukrainian publics do not confirm this and paint a depressing picture: Russian missiles ""fly wherever they want."" However, the work of air defense can still be noticed: a missile fell in Moldova, which experts on the image of debris identified as ammunition from the S-300 air defense system. It seems that Ukraine continues to hit its neighbors. Fortunately, unlike the tragedy in Poland on November 15, this time no one was injured by the Ukrainian air defense. OFFICIAL. The Russian Defense Ministry officially reports. ""Despite the attempts of the Kiev regime to disrupt the combat work of the Russian long-range aviation with a terrorist act, today at about 15.00 hours (Moscow time) a massive blow was inflicted on the military control system and related objects of the defense complex, communication centers, energy and military units of Ukraine with high-precision air- and sea-based weapons.

""To do this, each of the participants in the operation will be provided with postal envelopes and writing utensils,"" the Defense Ministry emphasized. By the way, letters from the front of Soviet fighters after the Great Patriotic War became documentary evidence, which required a separate study of modern historians. They made it possible to reconstruct events that were not reflected in official reports and reports. Based on these materials, a five-volume collection ""Last Letters from the Front"" was even published. The Ministry of Defense of Russia together with the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Education and the executive authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation launched the all-Russian youth action ""Front Postcard"" on the eve of the New Year. Schoolchildren, cadets, cadets, students and listeners will prepare individual and group New Year's greetings for servicemen taking part in a special military operation. For those on the front lines and hospitals. Video cards will be recorded for our fighters, and younger schoolchildren will make gifts and Christmas decorations."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4687453/,Valentin ALFIMOV,2022-12-05,Ukraine's population has already halved. How many of them will be able to survive the winter?,"The West and the leadership of The Independent State are literally ready to sacrifice the Ukrainian nation for their own purposes. Winter has already come, the front near Donetsk is crunching under the onslaught of Russia. Will Zelensky be able to continue to deceive the freezing people in such conditions?","Russia is attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure, methodically disabling substation after substation. Reports say that cities and even entire areas remain immersed in darkness. Transport, utilities do not work... On the fronts, Russia also began to press the Ukrainian army, recapturing village after village. Even the West is in a panic about whether it is necessary to continue to maintain such a black independent hole. And winter is coming. Will Ukraine be able to survive it? With this question, we turned to the ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, the former speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya Oleg Tsarev. - Why has Russia already inflicted several massive blows on the energy facilities of Ukraine. - Because these are the objects that are easiest to disable. Where the effectiveness of missile attacks is maximum. These are transformer substations. Such transformers are not produced in Ukraine. I myself once built a factory. I know how much the networks cost - design, manufacture, order, installation. Very long and expensive. That's why the substations are being hit. - We beat, the lights go out, and after a day or a week everything is already in order: television works, heat is supplied. Repair. - Thanks to the Ukrainian propaganda for the blissful picture. We (and Ukrainians too) see only a small part of what is happening in the energy sector of Ukraine. Light in homes is not the main thing. Most of the energy goes to industrial facilities. And they suffer. And it is more and more difficult to repair each time. We know this in peaceful life: a transformer broke down, spare lines were turned on, electricians arrived, new parts were inserted - and that's it. But today these reserves are becoming less and less. And they themselves say that a few more blows and the system will fall. There will be no single energy system, there will be only islands throughout Ukraine, which will supply electricity sporadically. - No light - everything will stand up. - I remember it well from Lugansk, Donetsk, Crimea. Our civilization is based on electricity. If it doesn't, we're falling into the Stone Age. Mobile communications, subway, sewerage, heating (pumps should pump water) do not work, there is no water, business stands up, there is no place to work, to receive a salary. - Will the trains get up? And the delivery of weapons from the West. - Since the blessed Soviet times, we have a huge number of diesel locomotives that were in reserve at junction stations. They were kept specifically in case of war. So, alas, they will provide a minimum cargo flow. - What do people think? What are their moods. - Of course, life without light and without work does not inspire optimism. Yes, propaganda assures that this, on the contrary, will strengthen the resolve of Ukrainians, mobilize them. It's not that. My Ukrainian friends perceive all this as a catastrophe that is approaching, and it is unclear when there will be a way out and an outcome. - Why then many decided to stay in Ukraine. - First of all, men can't leave. Secondly, there are still hopes. Look at the authorities - they do not say that there will be a catastrophe. They say it's overdue soon. Many believe, wait. - And there are those who are waiting for the arrival of Russia. - I have a lot of appeals: ""Stop shelling us, it is better to come faster, occupy the territory. How long can you wait?. - There really are a lot of them. - I won't say the majority, but they are. That's for sure. This is written by friends and just subscribers to my Telegram channel. - And what are people in Ukraine thinking about now? About politics or how to keep warm. - When the lights are turned off, people begin to be interested in the simplest household things: how to eat, where to charge the phone, when to have time to collect water. Turning off heating in cities is yet to come. It's going to be a disaster. But already now people pay less attention to front-line reports. Politics is not watched on TV. And the TV itself is less likely to work. I have no doubt that this worries Zelensky's office. - What to expect in winter at the fronts. - I can only speculate. But, apparently, the strategy is to strengthen the defenses in Zaporozhye and Luhansk region and move the front line away from Donetsk so that there is no shelling of the city. Ideally, walk to Slavyansk and unblock the water supply to Donetsk. Vodokanal is blocked by Ukraine there. - So you don't expect active movement. - So far, I can't see anything that would portend that. It is clear that our Ministry of Defense does not lay out plans, but we are accustomed to the fact that foreign intelligence closely monitors the entire theater of military operations and leaks data on the movements of our troops to the press. But for now, they are silent. - The West took Ukraine on the maintenance completely. Gives weapons, money. Will he have the reserves and patience to feed Ukraine this winter? - We have heard statements that ""the West is tired of Ukraine"". But there is an important factor. From the Point of View of the West, the conflict with Russia in Ukraine is actually a confrontation between Russians and Russians. Ideally, for Russian money. They themselves spend a tiny amount on this compared to the same Afghanistan, the war in which, according to various estimates, cost from a trillion to three trillion dollars. So far, the West has spent only $100 billion on Ukraine. - And what does ""for Russian money"" mean. - The West arrested half of Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves. That's $300 billion. And they are preparing to confiscate this money. Plus, the assets of Russian corporations and businessmen were arrested - another 200 billion. Compare - the European Union has so far allocated only 18 billion to Ukraine. This is even less than the interest on the capital seized from us. Such a conflict in Ukraine is beneficial to the West. - We have the opportunity to prevent the confiscation of our reserves. - For example, in response, we have not yet arrested anything from the West on our territory. On the contrary, we have paid $250 billion on loans alone this year. That's a lot of money. Perhaps this attitude can be revised. INSTEAD OF BOTTOM LINE. ""They will feel what they themselves did with Donbass. - Yes, Ukraine will be able to survive the winter, - Oleg Tsarev sums up. - Even without many of the benefits of civilization. Those who say no should look at the territory of Donbass. There are now almost the same problems with electricity, water, heating. In the same way, Ukraine hits transformers and other infrastructure of the cities of the DPR, LPR. For Ukraine, it will be an unusual, terrible life. But many in Kiev, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv will be able to feel for themselves what they themselves did for eight years with Donetsk and Lugansk. EXPERT COMMENT. Professor of MGIMO, Director of the Center for Military-Political Studies Alexey Podberezkin. - How much the West can pour into Ukraine at all. - Of course he can. The question is how effective. From a military-technical point of view, this effectiveness is already minimal. Everything that was in the warehouses has already been swept away, they began to withdraw from the NATO troops. Yes, the US military-industrial complex is capable of unwinding. But it's not fast either. I think at the beginning of 2023, when the results of expenses for 2022 are similar, they will think. At least in the EU countries. - But in the same NATO, they do not cease to declare: support for Ukraine will continue and intensify. - The wording - ""will help"", ""strengthen"" - does not oblige to anything. Yes, they will supply 100 transformers of some 5 kilowatts. Can this replace Ukraine's energy system? Of course not. And they will not be able to make large transformers during this time. Winter has already begun!"

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""The audacity of the troops is not an obstacle,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And he gave instructions to the warriors: ""In two rows of strength, in three and a half forces: the front tears, the second falls, the third completes."" SAVED THE SOLDIERS UNDER FIRE. Corporal Sergey Samoilenko. ""Acting as part of an engineering and technical company, sapper Corporal Sergey Samoilenko performed tasks to demine the infrastructure of one of the settlements. On a daily basis, in conditions involving a risk to life, he performed tasks to detect, neutralize and destroy explosive devices installed by the enemy that pose a danger to the civilian population. After the successful task of clearing the settlement, Corporal Samoilenko was given the task of delivering materiel for the equipment of fortifications of the defense line. Moving along the route, the column, which included Sergei, was subjected to artillery fire from Ukrainian nationalists. Instantly assessing the situation, Sergei led a group of servicemen out of the fire to a safe place, which saved their lives. At the same time, Sergei himself was wounded, however, he independently provided himself with medical assistance and continued to perform tasks, as a result of which the material resources were delivered to the specified area in a timely manner, which made it possible to strengthen the defensive lines of our troops and repel the attack of the nationalists. "" HE REPELLED A COUNTERATTACK BY MILITANTS ON THE VILLAGES. Major Eugene Kuznetso. ""Major Yevgeny Kuznetsov, acting as part of a brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, carried out tasks to defend one of the settlements liberated during fierce battles with Ukrainian nationalists. The enemy, seeking to regain possession of the village, subjected the positions of the Russian troops to massive artillery and mortar fire. Being on the front lines of defense, Evgeny Kuznetsov, together with his subordinates, was one of the first to engage in battle with the militants. Holding back the offensive of the militants, Major Kuznetsov, together with his wards, provided cover for the regrouping Russian units and prevented the nationalists from breaking through. During the unequal battle, the nationalists, despite the numerical superiority, suffered significant losses in the battle with the unit of Major Kuznetsov. After the Russian units regrouped, Yevgeny withdrew his unit from enemy fire and organized a move to new positions. Thanks to the courage and dedication of Evgeny Kuznetsov, as well as the courage and professionalism of his subordinates, the enemy, who suffered significant losses, was thrown back to his original positions. "" DESTROYED A NATIONALISTO GROUP IN THE BATTLE. Sergeant Vladimir Nagae. ""Acting as part of a motorized rifle unit, the senior rifleman of the motorized rifle department, Sergeant Vladimir Nagaev, performed the task of holding a strategically important height. The nationalists attempted to take the heights. The attack of the militants was accompanied by artillery and mortar shelling. Vladimir, being on the front line of the defense line, under heavy fire from enemy artillery and tanks, personally killed 5 militants. Sergeant Nagaev also helped wounded comrades and evacuated them from enemy fire to cover. Thanks to the courage, bravery and selfless actions of Sergeant Vladimir Nagaev, the attacking group of militants was destroyed on the approaches to the heights."""
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4687435/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-05,"Latest news on the situation around Ukraine on December 5, 2022: Ukrainian hospitals sentence their patients, and arms supplies from the United States threaten to be interrupted","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 5, 2022","Kiev happily reported that the first ship with grain in the framework of the Grain From Ukraine program reached Ethiopia. It delivered 25,000 tons of wheat. Another ship is preparing to be sent to Somalia. The grain From Ukraine program last fall in his video for the participants of the G-20 summit was proposed by the sixth president of the independent country. The scheme is as follows: countries that support the initiative buy agricultural products from Ukrainian producers, and then transfer it to countries on the verge of famine. One question is, why are there mediators here? And the current ""gift"" is less than a quarter of a percent of what Kiev has already pushed to the West as part of a grain deal. U.S. intelligence believes that in the coming months, the pace of combat operations in the independent sector will decrease. U.S. National Intelligence Chief Avril Haynes said at a forum organized in California by the Reagan Presidential Foundation: ""We are already seeing that the pace of the conflict has slowed somewhat and expect to see it in the coming months."" But Haynes is concerned about how the situation in the conflict zone will develop on the eve of spring. Well, how it will develop - streams will run and wash away all the dirt in the Dnieper and in the Black Sea. Lara Seligman, a columnist for Politico, suggested that aid to Kiev would be reduced if Washington adopted a one-year funding resolution instead of a full-fledged military budget. Seligman writes, ""Pentagon officials have compiled a list of serious consequences if the military, for the first time in history, has to act under a one-year interim funding law, from aid to Ukraine to problems with the purchase of new B-21 bombers."" The resolution will cut Pentagon funding by $29 billion, or 3.7 percent, compared to President Joe Biden's request for fiscal year 2023. That would delay the modernization of the industrial base for a number of key systems — including the Abrams tank and the M777 towed howitzer — the latter among the weapons the U.S. military is transferring to Ukraine. Well, they will do without the ""three axes"". A military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti that Kiev is preparing a provocation to disrupt the UN initiative to resume the transit of ammonia through the Togliatti-Odessa pipeline. For this purpose, explosions are being prepared on the dome roofs of ammonia storage facilities on the territory of the Odessa Port Plant. They will destroy the suspension floors and the infrastructure of the overload shop. The explosion will be passed off as a ""missile strike by the Russian army."" According to the source, ""the provocation was planned under the control of representatives of the British special services located in Odessa."" And ""the implementation will fall on the contractors of the Canadian PMC GardaWorld. They protect the port infrastructure in the Odessa region."" The destruction of ammonia storage facilities in Odessa will lead to an increase in its value on the world market. This is beneficial to the United States and Britain. Who would have doubted. Rallies were held in the Italian capital, in which about 10 thousand people participated, where they demanded to stop supplying weapons to the Kiev regime. Protesters took to the streets of the city with flags and burning flares, protesting against the decision of the Italian government on the ""sixth package"" with a list of weapons to send independently before the new year. Rome, in particular, is going to send Kiev medium-range Aspide guided missiles to destroy air targets. The participants honored the memory of two Italian soldiers who died in the battle against the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbass. Yes, there are some. The press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan said that local police are looking for the authors of the letter about the allegedly planted explosive device in the building of the Ukrainian Embassy in Astana. It was reported that the consul of the Embassy of Ukraine appealed to the police with a complaint that a letter about the mining of the building had been sent to their e-mail at 15:08. The fact is registered in the information book of the Esil District Police Department. The press service, distributed on Sunday night, said: ""Special services arrived at the scene. No explosive devices were found during the inspection. The event was held without evacuation, the threat was removed."" Previously, threatening parcels came to the diplomatic mission of the independent in Western Europe. But brave Ukrainian diplomats continue to carry out their dangerous service of squeezing tears and money out of the governments of the Old World. It's a dangerous job... In the zoo of Mariupol, twins from a pair of lions Ilma and Simba recently appeared, but the mother refused to feed the cubs because of the stress received as a result of shelling. Employees of the menagerie moved them to other parents and fed the babies with milk from the pacifier. Kittens grow up healthy and actively play in the aviary. Earlier, a similar fate befell the cubs of the Ussuri tigress and the Bengal tiger. In Mariupol, after the spring riot of nationalists, they are already accustomed to saving not only people who suffered from stress and escaped starvation, but also animals. Natalia Sad, a spokeswoman for Ukroboronprom, said that Ukraine is completing the creation of its attack drone. Sad optimistically said: ""A number of successful trials are behind us. Let's move on to the electronic warfare test phase."" According to the spokesman, the withdrawal of the drone in combat conditions is planned before the end of 2022. It will be able to carry a warhead of 75 kilograms and have a flight range of up to 1000 kilometers. Nothing reminiscent of Turkish prototypes, no. Natalia Vishnevska, head of the press service of the health department of the Kyiv State Civil Administration, said that in Ukraine it is time for medical institutions to stop planned hospitalizations due to hostilities and possible work in conditions of power outages, water and heat supply. The duration of the measure is ""pending further recommendations"". In medical institutions, they should monitor how much they are ready to use backup sources of electricity and heat supply. Check the technical condition of generators, fuel reserves, the availability of wells or wells, tanks for clean and industrial water, stocks of medicines for at least one month, products for patients and workers. That is, for Ukraine today the well-known slogan is more relevant than ever: ""if you want to be healthy, temper yourself."" And don't get caught in an ambulance."

But General Surovikin proves his highest qualifications, arranging a real ""Russian meat grinder"" on the contact line for the enemy. At the same time, our command, on the contrary, tries to protect its soldiers as much as possible, taking the upper hand in the artillery confrontation, due to the number and quality of military equipment. What is happening on the line of the highest tension of forces in the Donbas, why do NATO COIN tactics not work against Russia and what is the strategic importance of Artemovsk-Bakhmut? These questions on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" were answered by a military expert, TASS observer, retired Colonel Viktor Litovkin. - When it comes to Bakhmut-Artemovsk, hot news comes from there, Kiev admits that this is a problem for them. It's hard there, but our military is moving forward. Why is this strategically important to us. - Because Bakhmut, which is still under Ukrainian control, but in fact it is a Russian territory, and the city is more correctly called Artemovsk, is an important railway and road junction. Through it go trains, convoys carrying weapons and ammunition to the lines of clashes. Near Artyomovsk there are salt mines, where military equipment, ammunition, where Ukrainian hospitals are located and much more. - From there comes the replenishment of the Ukrainian army. - Including. Although this replenishment is not always sufficiently prepared. But this is a replenishment, which is still led, after all, mainly not by Ukrainian majors and colonels, but more often by American instructors, and even more often by Poles. - The enemy's losses in this area are great. - There are a lot of them dying. It's just that Ukraine in the Donbas is plugging the gaps of its defense with human flesh. And that's also why it's quite difficult for us to advance. - We have fewer people in this area. - And this factor also matters. But we have more artillery installations, multiple launch rocket systems. And we, of course, continue to advance. - But we are advancing rather slowly... - Because we are confronted by the enemy in well-equipped positions. In several echelons. With concreted underground structures. - It is difficult to overcome them without losses. - Very difficult, but possible. Our command always tries to do without losses and does everything to save the lives of Russian soldiers. - Why don't nato's advanced tactics work for Ukrainians? - There's different training. Kiev often sends its soldiers and officers abroad for training. But we must understand that abroad they are now simply using a lot of money to train these people. Therefore, they teach them their tactical programs at an accelerated pace. They rarely meet the immediate conditions of battle against a serious and strong army. Such as the Russian one. - Two or three weeks in the UK do not make Rambo out of Ukrainians. - At the British, German, Czech training grounds, the Ukrainian military do not learn the practice of real combat. Well, they shot cardboard targets there. Well, ""went on reconnaissance"", well, they conducted several ambushes - where no one ""hurt anyone"". Do they get the skills of real fighting modern tanks there? Or whatever, they are taught how to deal with cruise missiles. - They don't teach. -Of course not! Moreover, Kiev does not have such air defense systems that are capable of intercepting such missiles. And the Ukrainian military is not trained to work on modern air defense systems. And the systems that the West has managed to supply to Ukraine are not ukrainians, but representatives of those countries that supplied these systems. - There are already a lot of them. - So far, a meager amount has been supplied. Seven Cheetah systems cannot block the sky at a distance of a thousand kilometers. - Ukraine is catastrophically losing people. - Ursula von der Leyen gave a figure of 100,000 people, but I think this figure was sharply underestimated. Their losses are greater. For every person killed in battle, according to military statistics, there are three to four deaths from wounds, not counting six or seven wounded or mutilated. Therefore, it is possible to imagine how many people Ukraine loses every day, without even delving into the statistical data that certain politicians cite. READ ALSO.

But they failed to stop the offensive of Russian troops. This was announced at the last briefing by the official representative of the Ministry of Defense Igor Konashenkov. Lieutenant General reported on the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past day: in the Donetsk direction, with a successful offensive on Artemivsk of the Donetsk People's Republic, Russian troops managed to destroy more than 50 Ukrainian servicemen, in the South-Donetsk direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in attempts to break through to Pavlovka, a unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was driven into a minefield and finished off with artillery, at Shevchenko the enemy lost 40 soldiers, on Kupyanskoye near Novoselovsky,  Kuzemovka, Kislovka and Yagodnoye left 60 enemy soldiers to lie, on Krasno-Limansky near Ploschanka, Chervonopopovka and Zhytlovka - 80. Konashenkov noted that the infliction of a fire defeat in the area of Serebryansky Forestry and the decisive actions of Russian troops thwarted the attacks of two assault groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of the village of Kremenna of the Luhansk People's Republic. In addition, in the area of the village of Chervona Dibrova of the Luhansk People's Republic, three sabotage and reconnaissance groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the temporary deployment point of the Ukrainian nationalist formation were destroyed. Together with the manpower, dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed during the day. In addition, air defense units, aviation, missile forces and artillery defeated during the day: 5 NATO rockets, 9 drones, a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force, two anti-radar stations of counter-battery warfare produced by the United States AN / TPQ-37, 69 artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in firing positions, manpower and military equipment in 187 areas. The representative of the Ministry of Defense noted that the destruction of targets that are located behind enemy lines with high-precision weapons continues. So, last night, a warehouse of ammunition and missile and artillery weapons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Novoalexandrivka, Zaporizhia region, and an oil depot in Shevchenkovo, Kharkiv region, were burned. They supplied ammunition and fuel to military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyansk direction. BATTLE SUMMARY. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, they have been destroyed. 337 - aircraft. 178 - helicopters. 2618 - unmanned aerial vehicles. 391 - anti-aircraft missile system. 6983 - tanks and other armored fighting vehicles. 909 - combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems. 3653 - field artillery and mortar guns. 7463 - units of special military vehicles.

The armed formations of the Kiev regime were knocked out of Pershe Travnya, Belohorivka, Andreevka, Kurdyumovka, in the main directions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine daily suffers consistently large losses during unsuccessful attacks. In the Bakhmut direction near Konstantinovka and Kupyanskoye near Kuzemovka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can no longer cope with the number of wounded. ""Three hundredths"" clogged all hospitals and schools in the rear. There is a catastrophic shortage of medical personnel and medicines. Therefore, wounded soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to amputate their limbs as soon as possible in order to avoid blood poisoning. Many do not have time and they die from gangrene. Like in the First World War, when the world did not yet know antibiotics. First of all, our soldiers cut out everything foreign from the map of Ukraine. During the week, only according to official data, the Ministry of Defense with the help of high-precision missile strikes eliminated a dozen temporary points of foreign mercenaries and more than 400 foreigners. Among them, most of all were Poles. Native artillery is working more and more accurately, as air defense units began to more confidently intercept any American radio-controlled missiles and shells in flight, depriving the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the ability to inflict counterattacks. All control channels of data transmission of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are under the control of our drones ""Orlan-10"" and ""Mosquito"", which are constantly on duty high in the sky. They paralyze even the communication centers of the nationalist command posts, which are located at a considerable distance from the front. This actually blocks the control system of Ukrainian armed formations. Along the line of contact, Russian troops are attacking Ukrainian nationalists, and thwarting their attempts to conduct counterattacks. In them, the armed formations of the Kiev regime lose every day not only hundreds of wounded and killed, but also faith in the possibility of revenge. The capture of Kleshcheyevka already gives our troops the opportunity to advance to Chasov Yar and cut down the supply routes of the enemy who settled there, and the loss of Kurdyumovka forces the Armed Forces of Ukraine to retreat to Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). From it, it is already more difficult for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to shell Horlivka. Military experts are confident that the new strategy of the commander of the OGVS Sergei Surovikin has already forced NATO generals to reconsider their plans for the supply of long-range weapons. They see that modern weapons do not help the Ukrainian military much. They sometimes and deliberately disable it, so as not to attract the attention of Russian artillery and aviation, and with any minor wound they flee from the battlefield. In the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, where there were acute interruptions in electricity and work at military enterprises, prostitution, trafficking in weapons, drugs and human organs has already flourished. They steal everything and everywhere. Do not disdain even the neighbor's diesel generators. Unknown people in the cities of Ukraine cut out cables by kilometers, which are disconnected from electricity at times. They pass them on non-ferrous metal. On the crimes, many Ukrainians are trying to quickly earn more money to go to Europe, where refugees have already begun to be denied material assistance. They know that there they will have to rely only on themselves. Surovikin's new strategy showed brilliant results. A few precise blows managed to unbalance not only the whole of Ukraine, but also make the European Union think. While the Kiev authorities are thinking about how to warm their rear, General Surovikin is rebuilding the defense line, which will soon allow the troops to launch a large-scale offensive along the entire front line.

And then he flew to Washington to eat with Biden. Macron and Biden and their wives are rumored to have killed 200 lobsters. But except for lobsters, emmanuel has nothing to remember after the visit - Biden patted him on the back (or lower) and said that ""the problems of the Indians of the sheriff do not care,"" and therefore he will not change the law that lures enterprises from the Old World to the United States. And then it dawned on Emmanuel that there was Putin, and he decided to return to the ""big political field"", remembering about Russia. "" We must think about the security architecture in which we will have to live tomorrow. This includes, in particular, the words of President Vladimir Putin that NATO is approaching the borders of Russia, deploying weapons that can threaten it - unexpectedly for others against the background of talks about the need for ""war with Russia until its complete destruction,"" Emmanuel said. ""This issue will be part of the peace debate, and we need to prepare for what will happen after the Ukraine conflict and think about how we can protect our allies and at the same time give Russia guarantees of its own security the moment we return to the negotiating table. An interesting statement and a serious attempt to ""return to the field from the bench"", we will not argue, but in how many hours will Emmanuel return to his former rhetoric? He's like that girl, ""everything is so sudden, so contradictory."" The European Union, the countries of the ""Big Seven"" and Australia, which joined them, finally agreed on a ""price ceiling for Russian oil"" at $ 60 per barrel (excluding transportation and other costs). The last to surrender was Poland, which agreed only to 30 bucks per barrel. But Kiev is not satisfied with such an agreement. The head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak hoped that everything would be as Poland wanted. Because that's what Ukraine wanted. ""The ceiling should have been twice as low,"" Yermak said. - It would be necessary to reduce to $ 30 in order to quickly destroy the enemy's economy. It would be better if a sick person thought about his economy, otherwise it will soon not be possible to see it even in the most powerful microscope. As well as about where to get a solar for tanks. The head of the board of NJSC Naftogaz, Alexei Chernyshev, at a meeting with the ambassadors of the G7 countries and the head of the EU delegation to Ukraine, hinted that his company, which was super-profitable under Yanukovych, again needed money. ""Naftogaz lacks $4 billion so that Ukraine can go through the heating season and buy the necessary amount of gas,"" Chernyshev said. - Taking into account the military risks, about 3 billion cubic meters of gas are needed to generate electricity for the period of the heating season, the cost of which exceeds $ 4 billion. The ambassadors diplomatically remained silent in response. No, well, I feel sorry for them. Zelensky, in general, demanded a trillion dollars to restore Ukraine. And 4 billion against this background is just a statistical error. Another country-ally of Ukraine from Monday cancels the exchange of hryvnia for euros. Earlier, the exchange of Ukrainian cash for local money was practiced in Poland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. But the lafa in these countries ended, and the hryvnias there ceased to be exchanged even out of pity. Now Lithuania joins this quartet of European states from December 5. During the validity of the permit for such a ""change"", Ukrainians exchanged a little more than 400 thousand hryvnias in Lithuania. And there was noise. Dmytro Sakharuk, Executive Director of Ukraine's largest energy holding DTEK, said on a telethon that it will take weeks for the transition of Ukraine's energy system to planned shutdowns from the current emergency and emergency shutdowns. And for this to happen, at least one condition must be met. ""The main condition is the absence of new shelling and destruction,"" Sakharuk outlined the problem. But no one will guarantee this to Kiev. However, this condition is not at all significant, for example, for the Kharkiv region. According to Alexander Kishinsky, Deputy Director of Kharkivoblenergo, all generating capacities have been destroyed in his farm. - The Russian Federation is shelling generating stations. Currently, there is no generation in the Kharkiv region, so emergency shutdowns continue, Kishinsky explained the situation and stated. - Lacks electrical energy. We take from neighboring areas. And those, of course, themselves are not eager to give it away, because they themselves do not have enough. Moreover, according to Ukrainian sources, the Office of the President of Ukraine now simply does not know what to do with the energy sector. The crisis with transformers deepened before the catastrophic situation, which began to heat Ukrainians daily with open flames, but for a short time, and without any missile and bomb strikes. The system cannot withstand power surges. The authorities of Mykolaiv were able to significantly raise the level of mobilization of the local population in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And they didn't need PR managers or police raids on evil places to do it. Everything brilliant is simple. As long as residents come to the ""invincibility points"" (tents where there are stoves-bourgeois and generators to warm up and charge gadgets, and you can also drink clean water), immediately after the entrance they are met by law enforcement officers who hand them mobilization summonses to appear at the military recruitment office. Both cheap and angry! True, not to say that this has a positive effect on the ratings of local authorities and Zelensky himself among the electorate. - President of Ukraine (so far) Volodymyr Zelensky refused the author of a petition that gained 25,000 votes to demobilize mobilized servicemen who had served one year at the request. Crazy! And who will fight in the trenches, Zelensky and Kvartal? Maybe you also want to go abroad. - U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland appears in Kyiv. Probably brought tea leaves and cookies with buns. To what part of the front will it bring. - In Croatia, the seized yacht Royal Romance, which is believed to belong to Viktor Medvedchuk, will be sold at auction. Bidding will begin with 200 million euros. I wonder who will return the money (or the yacht) if the real owner appears, and it turns out not to be Medvedchuk. - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg abruptly changed his rhetoric. If earlier he said that the task of the alliance is to help defeat Russia, now he suddenly said: ""The main task of NATO is to prevent the withdrawal of hostilities outside Ukraine."" Too sensible for the character, Ursulu von der Leyen has listened to anything. - The new government of Italy adopted a decree extending the supply of weapons to Kiev until December 31, 2023. That was what needed to be proven about these Eurogeans. - The authorities of Izyum decided to rename 22 streets, avenues of the city squares. All the old names were somehow connected with Russia - Pushkin, Gorky, Turgenev, Suvorov. All new – with Bandera, self-reliance and Russophobia – Bandera, Petlyura, Dudayev, Mazepa, etc. Tell me who your friend is, and I will tell you who you are...

""This is a law that will simply allow persons from four new subjects on the territory of the Russian Federation to conduct normal business activities,"" explains andrei Klishas, one of the initiators of the law, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Construction. So, according to the document, the information that was contained in the relevant registers of the DPR, LPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions - that is, data on the name, address and head - must be entered into the Unified State Register of Legal Entities (Unified State Register of Legal Entities) until December 31, 2022. As for the constituent documentation, for those legal entities that are located on the territory of the Donbas republics, it must be brought into line with Russian legislation by December 31, 2023. For entrepreneurs and organizations of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, this period has been extended until June 30, 2024. Organizations that do not comply with the requirements for constituent documents will be excluded from the register. And this is a complete ban on activities. Legal entities whose information about them is not in the registers of the LPR, DPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions can bring their constituent documents in line with Russian legislation and apply for entering information about them in the register or acquire the status of a branch (representative office) of a foreign legal entity. The deadline for such organizations is June 30, 2023, if they work on the territory of the DPR and LPR, and December 31, 2023 for legal entities from Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. If they do not bring the documents in line with Russian legislation within the designated period and do not receive the status of a branch of a foreign legal entity, they will be forbidden to work in Russia.

But, in order to ""stay in service"" after this date, they will need to register as an individual entrepreneur in the manner prescribed by law. By the way, the document signed by the president also clarifies the status of treaties and unilateral transactions concluded in new territories before their entry into the Russian Federation. According to the law, the terms of such contracts ""will remain in force, except in cases established by federal laws.""

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4689171/,Anna SHILYAEVA,2022-12-01,Industry: A New Era,We talk about how production is being revived in The Zaporizhzhya region,"In the Zaporozhye region, with the assistance of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia, a regional Industrial Development Fund was created. The head of the ministry called it ""the most important tool for working on industrial development projects."" After all, thanks to the fund, the capitalization of which is now being discussed with the executive authorities of the Russian regions, the restoration of the region's industry - primarily metallurgical and machine-building measures, as they say, will go more quickly. There are 53 of them in the region. Some, by the way, are already increasing their momentum, having recovered from the pressure of the Ukrainian authorities, who, with the beginning of the special operation, forbade people to go to work, threatening to go to prison in case of disobedience. Take, for example, the Zaporozhye Iron Ore Plant, which is developing a deposit that contains 4 percent of the all-Russian iron reserves. The company experienced turbulent times - the flight of most of the management, the renewal of the team, serious disruptions in production. And today we are reaching new indicators of ore mining. - This is the most unique enterprise in the world, - says the director of the plant Gleb Tersky. - We mine ore with an iron content of up to 68 - 69 percent. For comparison, there is usually up to 35 percent iron in the ore. Since 2014, the company has barely survived, its supply of ore to the enterprises of Donbass has stopped. And only with the arrival in the region of Russia the plant again ""breathed"". ""It is extremely important for our region to be actively involved in the restoration of industrial potential, which over the long years of the Kiev looting has made a big setback, and terrorist attacks from neighboring territories on industrial infrastructure facilities do not stop today,"" said Yevhen Balitsky. Although heavy industry and the basis, but not only it lives Zaporozhye region. Over the past few months, it has been possible to establish the work of half of the light industry enterprises. This was written in his official telegram channel by the acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky. ""The administration of the Zaporizhzhya region together with the Ministry of Industry and Energy of the region is doing a lot of work in all areas. According to experts, all enterprises will begin work in March 2023,"" he commented. By the way, a number of industries already have all the necessary feasibility studies in their hands, moreover, the companies have established cooperation with other Russian factories. There are already the first major contracts. - Today, nine light industry enterprises are officially registered in the region. Four of them have started work. The remaining five cannot yet start production, since the corps are located near the areas of combat contact, the head of the region said about the existing problems. Zaporizhzhya region already produces a whole line of various textile products. So, the plant ""Slavic Fluff"" produces pillows and blankets. - The largest in the region Berdyansk garment factory in early November successfully started work, contracts and contracts for sewing overalls are being concluded, in the future - the production of knitted products, - Balitsky emphasized. And soon the highly specialized Tokmak garment factory will begin to work. This enterprise is one of the few in Russia that produces overalls. And the unique equipment of the plant allows you to work with heavy fabrics. The Melitopol garment factory has already begun to produce overalls. One workshop is still operating at the plant, but the second one will soon be opened. It will work with knitwear. ""Our light industry, with the support of colleagues from other regions of Russia, is able to reach all its capacities,"" Evgeny Balitsky emphasized. THAT TIME. A cooperation agreement was signed with Chuvashi. The signing of the important document took place at a recent meeting between Balitsky and the Minister of Industry and Energy of the Chuvash Republic Alexander Kondratyev. Now the new Russian region and the Republic of Chuvashia together will be engaged in the restoration of electrical networks, the development of mechanical engineering, the establishment of the production of fertilizers and pesticides for the needs of agriculture. ""By the end of November, a road map will be created and direct contacts will be built with the enterprises of Chuvashia,"" Yevhen Balitsky said after the meeting, adding that today the industrialists of the Zaporizhzhya region are not only restoring the economic and strategic potential of the region, but also bringing victory closer."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4689170/,Anna SHILYAEVA,2022-12-01,Big renovation,"In the Zaporozhye region, roads are being put in order, which were not dealt with in Ukraine for decades","In the new region of Russia, a large construction project has unfolded. In the Zaporozhye region, social facilities are being actively repaired and built, communal services are being established. There are many tasks, and all are large-scale. As Acting Governor Yevgeny Balitsky said in his telegram channel, one of the priorities is the development of the road network of urban agglomerations. According to the information voiced by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the region Anton Koltsov, about 90 thousand square meters of roads will be repaired in the region by the end of the year. Thus, the repair of the Berdyansk-Melitopol highway is in full swing. The work is serious and costly. After all, a hundred-kilometer section of the road has not been restored for twenty years. The Ukrainian authorities did not find money for this. At the facility, work does not stop for an hour. There are constantly about a hundred road workers and at least 60 special vehicles. To ensure uninterrupted operation, three mobile asphalt concrete plants were launched in the region at once. Their capacities allow to ship five thousand tons of asphalt concrete mixture every day. ""It is important that the plants are mobile, they will be moved when repairing other sections of roads,"" Yevgeny Balitsky emphasized. At the same time, the road to the Crimea is being repaired. As told in the Ministry of Transport of the Zaporozhye region, it was planned to start repairing the Melitopol-Dzhankoy highway next year, but began as soon as possible. - The artery connecting the Zaporizhzhya region with the Crimea is in a very worn-out condition, so it was decided to start work this year. Workers are already engaged in milling the top layer of asphalt, a total of 120 kilometers of the road will be repaired with partial replacement of the base in the places of formation of road surface dips, the Ministry of Transport of the region specified. In addition, workers have already begun milling and laying the lower asphalt concrete layer of the bypass road of the city of Melitopol with a total length of just over seventeen kilometers. ""We are systematically moving towards the fulfillment of an important task - the restoration of infrastructure and agglomeration of roads in the region, which have not known repair for decades,"" the Ministry of Transport of the Zaporizhzhya region said. In parallel with such large-scale reconstructions, urban and village roads are being put in order. For example, in Akimovka, asphalt pavers and other specialized equipment literally did not touch the roads for forty years. The Ukrainian regime did not care. But now the work on the repair of roads is in full swing. - Roads in Akimovka have been waiting for repairs for 40 years! Now the work is in full swing. New asphalt will be laid on 11 streets. In total, 30 thousand square meters of road surface will be repaired here. And this means that it will be possible to forget about the pits, - said Yulia Gubanova, Acting Minister of Transport and Development of Transport Infrastructure of the Zaporizhzhya region. They have already begun to put in order the roads on young patriots street and in the market square. Also, workers are engaged in the most difficult section - from Shchorsa Street to Central Street, in parallel they are repairing the road to Suvorov, on Pushkin Street. By the way, they work both day and night. The head of the akimovka administration, Maxim Zubarev, said that workers from the Krasnodar Territory also came to help the locals. - Road workers work for days. I would like to thank the guys from Kuban, who are working to ensure that everything is beautiful in Akimovka, and smooth asphalt pleases our residents. To the Krasnodar Territory - a huge hello! He said. In the village of Novoye Veseloye near Melitopol, road workers also do not sit idly by. There, the dirt road will be covered with rubble. For this purpose, the Dniprorudny Iron Ore Plant provided 100 tons of stone and transport for delivery. In Melitopol, new road markings appeared on Druzhby Street, General Petrov Street, Vakalenchuk Street, Sadovaya Street, at a busy intersection in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Avenue and Bronzos Street. In the village of Malaya Ternovka, active residents and volunteers put the streets in order, removed garbage and thickets on vacant lots."

Such residents of the region will receive coal for free. Two tons each. - Very unexpected and pleasant, - admits a resident of one of the villages Marina Gorkovenko. - We are not used to such care. Under the Kiev authorities, residents had to buy solid fuel at their own expense every year. And for many, for example, pensioners, this is a huge financial burden. ""Two pensions went away - seven - eight thousand hryvnias,"" says another resident of the region, Lyudmila Ivanova. - And today I received coal for free. And here is what Ivan Semenov from Melitopol says. - We didn't have coal, we bought firewood. And what to do? But you can't drown with firewood, a lot of them go away, and then they said: ""We will bring coal."" And they brought it! I am very satisfied, thank you very much. According to the head of the administration of Melitopol Galina Danilchenko, in Melitopol the issuance of coal to privileged categories of citizens who do not have electricity and gas supply has already begun. According to her, the city has already organized delivery to more than 50 yards. - And more than 100 families will receive coal in the near future. Our main task is to provide socially unprotected categories of citizens with fuel during the heating season, to make sure that every house is warm and cozy,"" Danilchenko said. Solid fuel is received by residents of other cities and towns of the Zaporozhye region. REFERENCE ""KP. The following categories of citizens have the right to receive two tons of coal. veterans of the Great Patriotic War (war invalids, participants in hostilities, war veterans). persons affected by the Chernobyl disaster of the 1st and 2nd categories. large families (families with three or more children). pensioners over 80 years of age. invalids of I - II groups. To obtain preferential coal, you must contact the department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. KSTAT. In the Zaporizhzhya region, work continues to restore gas supply. According to Alexander Gomonov, Deputy Minister of Industry and Energy of the region, today more than 90 thousand families are again receiving gas.So, the supply of blue fuel was resumed in Berdyansk, Melitopol districts, as well as in Tokmak and adjacent settlements."

More than 70 missiles of the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system and two MLRS launchers were burned there. The military department noted that four more installations of this type received critical damage in the workshops of the enterprise, next to which Zelensky was once born.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4689147/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-07,A last resort from NATO and Washington. Ukraine risks being left without weapons,International relations expert Kramnik said that the United States can leave Ukrainian guns without shells,"In Ukraine, they will not wait for Russia to run out of missiles. After each massive blow to the infrastructure, they consider how much smaller our arsenal has become. But in Russia, the defense industry is constantly replenishing warehouses, but in Ukraine there is a significant shortage of ammunition. And this is due not only to the difficulties of delivering goods to the front due to problems with power grids, but also to a decrease in NATO supplies. And first of all, from the United States. ""Many people talk about this, this is a general observation,"" said Ilya Kramnik, a researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, speaking with Ivan Pankin and Igor Vittel. - The volume of supplies has fallen markedly, and the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has fewer opportunities than it was in the summer. Unfortunately, these opportunities are enough to terrorize peaceful residential areas. But for full-fledged front-line operations - no longer, the offensive capabilities of the Ukrainian troops have sharply decreased. According to Kramnik, the overwhelming majority of the supply of ammunition to the Armed Forces of Ukraine falls on NATO countries - more than 70 percent. ""Of these NATO supplies, the vast majority are from the United States,"" he says. - The rest deliver a lot less. And it was the reduction in American supplies this fall that became the most significant reason for the reduction of the arsenals of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - And what can be said about the Ukrainian defense industry. ""A huge part of the Ukrainian industry accounted for the republics of Donbass, which now Ukraine does not have and, obviously, will never have,"" the expert said. - And everything else that was produced in Ukraine, what still survived in Kharkiv, in Sumy, is far from the scale to talk about an independent military-industrial complex. There are some fragments of the military-industrial complex that can perform simple operations, but this is mainly due to the repair of equipment, but not to production. Not even with the production of ammunition. - What does the statement of the head of the Pentagon Lloyd Austin mean that Washington is not going to prevent Kiev from developing weapons for long-range strikes. - The States have repeatedly said that they want to supply Ukraine with long-range ammunition, which is designed to attack our territory. But Ukraine itself can theoretically produce fairly simple, simple devices for which they will be supplied with components. Let them not receive finished products from the West, but they will be sent, for example, a designer - a control system, wings, a body, a tail - they will put their accelerator there and can launch. And if this comes to us, then formally the West has nothing to do with it. - And they can work according to this scheme. -Can. Even in the conditions of a dilapidated military-industrial complex. That's what they do in Palestine, that's what they do in Yemen, that's what many more people do. - Do they have their own scientific groundwork? The school remained. - Done, of course. Kharkov remained, Kiev remained, Mykolaiv remained. But these are rather the dying remnants of a large industrial complex. These developments made sense when the USSR was alive. These developments were part of a huge military-industrial complex. And now everything is just dying out. Because the main customer has always been Moscow, the Soviet Ministry of Defense, then the Russian Ministry of Defense. They supported Ukraine for a long time with their orders. - They will not be able to do anything, even if the production is taken somewhere in Poland. - Depends on what you mean. To develop guided weapons themselves, drones, I think, yes, they will be able to. Still, they have enough engineering personnel to develop such things. Plus, they have a fairly developed production of aircraft engines in Zaporozhye. Of course, in what condition it is now, after the plant is periodically ""calibrated"", is a question. But there were engines, including for cruise missiles. If you combine such a case with the body and insert the simplest Western navigation satellite system into it, then it can be used simply as a kamikaze drone, it will fly to western coordinates.

No one stopped the blood. If the answers were not satisfied, they began to beat. First with your hands or feet, then with a helmet or even a butt. After interrogation, they were knocked to the floor. Three were holding, and the fourth with a knife cut off the little finger on his hand."" The soldier noted that he was still beaten with rebar and electric shock. On camera, under the threat of murder and reprisals against close relatives, representatives of Ukrainian armed formations demanded that Russian prisoners of war sign a ""voluntary"" consent to cooperate with Ukrainian special services. ""The testimonies of Russian servicemen indicate that representatives of Ukraine grossly violate the requirements of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, prohibiting cruel treatment, torture and torture,"" said Svetlana Petrenko, an official representative of the Investigative Committee of Russia. Now the Investigative Committee of Russia, together with the operational services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Fsb of Russia, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, continues to identify Ukrainian nationalists involved in the torture and murder of civilians, as well as Russian servicemen who have been captured. Investigators continue to collect and record evidence of the brutal crimes of the nationalists, so that none of them evades criminal responsibility.

According to Al-Zeyudi, this ""will help accelerate the recovery of Ukraine's economy and create new opportunities for exporters, investors and producers, as well as facilitate cooperation in such important sectors as infrastructure, heavy industry, aviation, information technology and food security."" And in Dubai, optimists are sitting on what Ukrainian aviation and information technologies by mid-2023 they are going to negotiate with a country that is moving at a brisk pace into the Stone Age. ""Gifts"" from Ukraine fly to Moldova. The speaker of the Moldovan parliament, Igor Grosu, said that it is necessary to wait for the end of the investigation into the rocket debris that fell in the north of Moldova. In an interview with Pro-TV, he said: ""Again a fragment that exploded on our territory. Now in Briceni. Very close to the border with Ukraine. It's serious, even if nothing exploded."" In the autumn, the vital signs of the Ukrainian air defense system were already falling in Moldova. The method of deduction can be assumed: these are again Ukrainian neighbors. Yes, you will ask the Poles. The United States reported how it helps Kiev ""to return the territory. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States continues to help Ukraine so that it can ""return the territories occupied by Russia this year."" At The Wall Street Journal conference, Blinken said, ""Our focus is on continuing to do what we've been doing, which is to make sure that Ukraine has in its hands what it needs to defend itself, to fight back against Russia, to regain territory that has been occupied since Feb. 24."" In his opinion, in addition to military, Kiev needs economic and humanitarian support. The Secretary of State did not say anything serious about Crimea. I waved at him. The drones did not reach Sevastopol. Two drones heading from the territory of Ukraine towards Sevastopol were destroyed over the Black Sea on the night of December 6. Both UAVs were shot down by Russian air defenses and fell into the sea, causing no damage to either the fleet or the city. A rare ugly bird will fly to the city of Russian maritime glory. In Belgorod, teroboron battalions are formed. In the Belgorod region, according to Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, the formation of territorial defense detachments has begun. They will include men who are not subject to conscription for military service due to age or health reasons. Those who want to defend their native land will be trained by instructors with combat experience, It is planned to form several battalions that will be trained in the border areas. The enemy will not pass or crawl. In Kiev, a list of two thousand enemies was compiled. The National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NACP) of Ukraine said: ""Almost 2,000 propagandists will soon fall under sanctions in Ukraine."" Citizens of Russia, Belarus and a number of other countries, including musicians, journalists, bloggers, media editors, employees of television companies and publishing houses, will fall under restrictive measures. A package of proposals for the introduction of personal sanctions against these persons was approved by the interdepartmental working group on the implementation of the state sanctions policy. The proposal will be considered by the National Security and Defense Council. The main thing is that the generator works when the lists will be studied and approved.

""The target of the strike has been achieved. All assigned objects are affected. As a result of the strike, the production and repair of Ukrainian weapons at the enterprises of the military-industrial complex was stopped, the railway transportation of military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including foreign production, was disrupted. It is difficult to transfer reserves to combat areas. There were no missile strikes on the city of Kyiv,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said at a briefing. Recall, on Monday, Ukrainian drones attacked military airfields in the Ryazan and Saratov regions. Three soldiers were killed and four were wounded. Investigators described the attack as a terrorist attack. On the same day, the Russian army launched a massive strike with air- and sea-based weapons, hitting 17 Ukrainian infrastructure facilities in several cities at once. According to a number of media outlets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, the blow fell on the metallurgical plant ""Arcelor Mettal"". In the Kiev region, the Severnaya 330 substation was damaged, which paralyzed the movement of electric trains. Near Odessa, three substations were also put out of operation. They fed the pumping stations, were responsible for the supply of water, light and the operation of electric transport. In Zaporozhye, a missile destroyed the Dnipro-Donbass substation and the workshop of the high-voltage equipment plant, where high-voltage transformers were produced. So it will not be possible to restore the substation on its own in the near future. In response, the Armed Forces of Ukraine sent their drones to an airfield in the Kursk region, where one of them damaged an oil storage tank, causing a fire.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4688517/,Nikolay VARSEGOV,2022-12-06,Kiev said that the USSR staged a conscious genocide of Ukrainians. History has not yet been rewritten so boorishly.,Germany accused the USSR of genocide of Ukrainians in 1932-1933,"The German parliament, believing in another Ukrainian lie, recognized the Holodomor as genocide. However, the truth about that tragedy lies on the surface, says our columnist Nikolai Varsego. Did Stalin know in 1932 that a terrible famine was approaching Ukraine, like other regions of the USSR? I had this question from reading an article by Gareth Johnson, a reporter for the Times, published in 1932. Here's a quick excerpt. ""The situation in Ukraine (and in the whole of Russia) is terrible; everything is lousy, there is no food, there is only bread... . I've seen something so bad that it me off when I think about how people like Bernard Shaw go to a place where they're led by the nose, they eat plenty, and then they call Russia a paradise. Winter will bring great suffering, people are starving. ... One of the reasons why I left Yuzovka (Donetsk) so quickly is that I managed to find only a loaf of bread from food - I had nothing more to eat until seven o'clock. Many Ukrainians are so weak that they are unable to work. Nevertheless, tremendous progress has been made in many sectors, and there is a good chance that with the completion of the five-year plan, Russia can become successful. ... The Communists achieved excellent results in education, hygiene and the fight against drunkenness. Prices are monstrous, and shoes can not be found. There's nothing in the stores."" How is it that there is a famine in Ukraine, and Western reporters are easily allowed there? And this is at a time when the USSR is desperately creating an image of the most prosperous country. In the same 1932, in the Land of the Soviets, a film was released on the Russian and... even in Yiddish, The Return of Nathan Becker. Plot: The Jew Nathan foolishly left the USSR for America. Having suffered grief there, he returned to the USSR again, but with a comrade in misfortune - a negro. And now in the Land of the Soviets, Nathan and the Negro have known all the joy of life - thanks to socialism. The leadership of the USSR spared neither effort nor money for the PR of their country. Almost every film told how happy, cheerful, well-fed Soviet people live in contrast to the unfortunate ones in the countries of capitalism. «... And the joy sings uncontacted, and the song goes towards it, and people laugh when they meet, and the oncoming sun rises."" ... And then a Western reporter came and wrote this. We can safely assume that the Kremlin does not yet know about hunger with either an ear or a snout. They do not know, because the local leadership reports only on successes. The Soviet press, of course, does not write anything about the famine. But now Ukrainian liars, declaring genocide, paint us approximately the following picture: the Russian comrade Stalin (Dzhugashvili), gathering his associates, said: let's arrange genocide against Ukrainians through the Holodomor, because these Ukrainians (according to Russophobes) are advanced people and are dangerous for Moscow. So, the Kremlin approved the plan of genocide. And at the same time, no one realized that the death of Ukrainians from exhaustion would not only spoil the image of the Land of the Soviets, but also kill, leave completely without workers Ukrainian plants, factories, which in the same 1932 were built throughout Ukraine, according to another plan of the Kremlin. After all, at the same time, the first current was issued by the largest in all of Europe Dneproges. The metallurgy giant Azovstal is being completed, hundreds of plants and factories are being built and expanded from Kharkiv to Kherson and Odessa. Ukraine has the widest scope of industrialization. Actually, this industrialization became one of the three causes of famine, because village ploughmen massively poured into the construction sites of socialism. And there was almost no one to work in the fields. Only in 1937, in this regard, a law would be passed prohibiting villagers from moving to the city, otherwise famine would strike again. The second cause of the famine, as you know, was a terrible drought. And the third reason, of course, is the stupidity in the management of agriculture. The famine then struck not only Ukraine, but also Kazakhstan, the Caucasus, Western Siberia, the Volga region, the Central Black Earth region of Russia. And if anything, the death toll from starvation in the RSFSR is no less than in Ukraine. And Russia can also appeal to their Bundestag with a request to recognize the genocide of Russians in 1932-1933, taking advantage of the illiteracy of local deputies. Only we are above that. And historical lies are the lot of Ukrainian politicians and propagandists. Subscribe to the new podcast of Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"", in which we tell you what will happen next."

But there has probably been no such shelling since '14. The cannibalistic logic of the artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their commanders is clear: the Western and its air defense, which was supposed to protect Ukraine from strikes on the energy infrastructure, absolutely ""leaky"", does not really work. So, they will take revenge on those whom they can reach - ordinary citizens. Since the summer, Donetsk has noticed that Ukrainian artillerymen began to choose paradoxical targets when shelling the city center: not buildings, but roads and sidewalks. JCCC experts unofficially confirmed to the kp special cortex - this is not an accident, so the scattering of fragments is higher, which means that more people will be ""hooked"" or killed. The republican authorities had information that the shelling of Donetsk would continue and intensify. It is no coincidence that the head of the Republic on Monday evening ordered to transfer as many employees as possible to remote work ... But, it is impossible to transfer everyone to ""remote"". Again, the target for the shelling was the ""Covered Market"" in the city center. A few months ago, in September, he was covered with artillery, hit by a minibus, there were killed and wounded. On the ""Covered"" during the day, especially at noon, it is always crowded. There is a very good and cheap canteen, employees from numerous offices have lunch in it, there is also ""Donmak"" - the Donbass analogue of the American fast food chain and dozens of stalls with fast food. There are always queues near them, sometimes you need to stand for a couple of tens of minutes. Students, managers, doctors... Guaranteed crowds, guaranteed casualties. How many were killed and wounded in this shelling remain to be determined. At the moment, it is known that Grad shells and missiles hit the courthouse and the prosecutor's office, the Centaur Plaza office building, the Donbass Arena area, and the Covered Market. Traditionally, Pushkin Boulevard was shelled, the day is sunny and the freaks knew that there would be a lot of people and most likely, mothers with children. It also went to the neighboring Makiivka, a huge satellite city, half the size of Donetsk. In Makiivka, they tried to hit the power substation. The only thing that the gunners of the Armed Forces of Ukraine achieved was that people began to move from the once calm center to the outskirts. But, there are no quiet outskirts in Donetsk. Not yet. Paradoxically, in the moments of the shelling of Donetsk, the President of Ukraine allegedly calmly posed near the stele painted in Zhovto-Blakit colors at the entrance to Slavyansk.

Dmitry Trusov, together with his subordinates, immediately moved to the positions of the interacting unit, provided first aid to the wounded and organized their evacuation to a safe place. Under massive artillery fire, Senior Lieutenant Dmitry Trusov independently carried out two comrades-in-arms from under fire, then returned to his positions and continued to hit the enemy with the fire of his battery. During the counter-battery struggle, Russian artillerymen under the command of Dmitry Trusov destroyed a platoon of enemy guns 2A65 ""Msta-B"".

In one of the tactical directions, supporting the offensive of Russian motorized rifle units, Andrei Kryukov waged a counter-battery struggle against the artillery crews of the nationalists. Having moved to the firing line, he timely prepared the technical means for conducting radar reconnaissance, by competent and professional actions detected the enemy's flying shells in the air, calculated their trajectory, the class of fire systems and the coordinates of several enemy positions at once, transferring them to our artillerymen. In the course of the retaliatory fire on the targets of Ukrainian militants, a control point, two american-made towed guns and up to two dozen Ukrainian nationalists were destroyed.

Andrei Marochko, an officer of the People's Militia of the LPR, said that cases of psychosis and toxic lesions of the liver and kidneys in soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the zone of the SVO have become more frequent. They drink and prick a lot. Because they are afraid and do not want to go to hell. Paramedics in the conflict zone sounded the alarm and began to ask for help from volunteers. But there are not enough specialists to work with such patients. And it is not possible to send perfectionists to specialized institutions. Now fear is not the most terrible force. Americans marveled at the cold resistance of the Ukrainians. Isabelle Khurshudyan, a columnist for The Washington Post, was surprised that the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are afraid to start fire in the fields and tremble like tsutsiki because of their proximity to Russian positions. In particular, this happens near Kremennaya. A journalist from the United States also noted that Ukrainian soldiers spend chilly nights in sleeping bags in the open air. Well, where they should spend the night hours - in five-star hotels with slot machines. Moscow is concerned about the safety of the Zaporizhzhya Autonomous District. Sergei Ryabkov, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, said that Moscow sent proposals to the IAEA with specific parameters for creating a safety zone around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The deputy foreign minister explained that ""the main problem is that there is no confidence in Kiev's readiness to sensibly approach this issue."" Ryabkov said that Kiev would like ""under the guise of resolving this issue in contact with the IAEA, we leave there. Then the station will be immediately captured. We can't go for it."" In Kiev, they think differently. Although the verb ""think"" is not applicable in this case. Dreaming and frustrating. Russia does not recognize the genocide of Ukrainians. The Russian Embassy in the United States said that our country rejects the resolution of the US Senate Committee on recognizing Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The embassy noted that American lawmakers groundlessly refer to the pseudo-historical postulates of Ukrainian nationalists about the ""Holodomor"". And no one studies the documents. It is important for them, as the classics said, ""to plunge into eternity."" The smell will melt, the feeling of nastiness will remain. Crimea shoots down drones like mosquitoes. A wild drone sent by crooked cotton-pickers from Nikolaev was shot down in the sky over the water area near Sevastopol, said the head of the city Mikhail Razvozhaev. The governor of Sevastopol noted that the UAV was leveled by the duty ship of the Black Sea Fleet. The head of the city emphasized: ""The military, as always, worked clearly."" But Kiev, of course, will again report on the victory of Ukrainian weapons over the orcs. Zelensky called Ukrainians leaders in influencing them. The sixth president of Ukraine recorded a video message for Politico, where he said that Ukrainians have become ""number one"" in terms of influence in the world. The former comedian said: ""I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year, but in peacetime."" And he listed the fields of gigantic battles where his valiant elves are waging victorious titanic battles with the forces of evil. It seems that they wanted to change the drug dealer and change the drugs - did they really not have time? Maybe the cotton should be evacuated to Kislovodsk, for a complete cleansing of the body from intoxication. Ukrainians shell Belgorod region. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the head of the Belgorod region, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine on December 8 shelled a village in the Yakovlevsky urban district. During the shelling, the power line was damaged. In the Belgorod region until December 21, the ""yellow"" level of terrorist danger was extended. In addition, the decree banning the launch of firecrackers, fireworks and fireworks in the region was extended for two weeks. But this will not help Kiev to hold its New Year's celebrations. Kiev also wants Afghan money. Through diplomatic channels, Kiev asked Brussels for the transfer of funds from the fund that NATO used to support official Kabul, until the power in the country was seized by guys who call themselves the Taliban, who are not too welcome in our open spaces. About $ 3.4 billion hung up on the fund's accounts. Their Western countries did not have time to spend on helping the Afghan government loyal to the West. Greedy raguls want to spend these billions on a holy struggle with Mordor. The main thing is that indigestion does not occur, otherwise it will be wet and disgusting. LISTEN AS WELL.

The navigator took the grenade, I pulled the ring out of it.","31-year-old Pyotr Kashtanov on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" told how he completed the combat mission and, despite the wound, led the crew to his","On the eve of heroes of the Fatherland Day, Komsomolskaya Pravda journalists met with an officer whose plane was shot down over enemy territory. But he completed the combat mission and, despite being wounded, led the crew to his own. Short, modest and, in appearance, a very young senior lieutenant tries to be sociable and relaxed. ""Peter,"" he extends his right hand. And by the weak, as if unnaturally constrained handshake, we understand that the pilot has not yet recovered to the end. In September, his Su-34 fighter-bomber was shot down over enemy territory while performing a combat mission in the special operation zone. The situation is a stalemate - he has a broken arm, the navigator has a compression fracture of the spine, around him - enemies. But by some miracle, both manage to get out to their own. And now in front of us sits, as if descended from the pages of Boris Polevoy's ""Tale of a Real Man"", a Russian officer Pyotr Kashtanov. On the chest of the 31-year-old starley, the Star of the Hero of Russia plays with glare. - You remember how that day began. - From the ascent, as usual. At 6 a.m., I got up, washed my face, and had breakfast. And I went to get the task. Also nothing supernatural - a flight to destroy enemy equipment. It's already routine: take off, work, come back, prepare, take off, work, come back. - How many such flights per day can there be. - In different ways, - the officer does not disclose official information professionally. - We approached the plane with the navigator, inspected, checked the weapons, sat down, began to buckle up, launch, take off ... The pilot casually tells how at great speed they flew at ultra-low altitudes - below 25 meters. This is so that you understand when power lines ""jump"". So there is less chance that they will be shot down. As they approached the target - a column of enemy equipment. How they ""worked on the enemy"" and began to move away from the target in the direction of their troops. Turned 70 degrees and here. - A powerful blow. - As in an accident? - Here's a silly analogy. ""Almost,"" Peter replies diplomatically. - Shook us, and immediately the rotation along the axis began, there was very little time to make a decision - a maximum of 3-4 seconds. Thank goodness we had enough. - At what height was the strike. - About 50 meters. - You give the command to eject. - We are together. The navigator said, ""We've been hit."" I immediately checked the controls, the plane is uncontrollable. I just had time to say: ""Let's go out"" and put into operation the ejection system. - Next thing. - The blow is strong, it's all fleeting, and I'm already on a parachute. For 10-15 seconds, we probably went down to the ground. When I landed, I realized that my right hand wasn't working. Left freed himself from the suspension system and began to look for a navigator. He landed 15 meters away. - Those 10-15 seconds, when we were still in the air, what were we thinking. - How do we get out now. Which way to go. - You crawled up to the navigator. -Ran. He's motionless. I started to take off his helmet, the hanging one. He had already begun to recover. And the first thing he said was, ""Leave me here, save yourself."" - We can name the navigator. - Dmitry Koptilov. - What did you say to him. - I said: ""Nikolaich, I will not leave without you. Let's get out together."" I didn't even think of leaving him there. I just grabbed him by the unloading and dragged him away. - With one hand. -Think so. We should have at least given ourselves ""painkiller"" injections. The first 30 meters were overcome, the navigator says: ""Unbearable pain."" I realized that I had to stab. - And you didn't have unbearable pain. - Yes, I somehow didn't feel it. Adrenaline. We first overcame a little swamp, that is, we swam in the non-commercial season. Only put on the ""anesthesia"", and we can already see - the Armed Forces of Ukraine arrived on three or four cars. We decided that we would not surrender. I took out a grenade and screwed a fuse into it. The navigator also has one arm, the left, my right is damaged. He took a grenade in his left. I said, ""Hold on, Nikolaich, I'm going to get the ring now."" And we started waiting. The Armed Forces of Ukraine began to comb the area. They were up to the platoon, I guess. - You've prepared to blow yourself up with one grenade. How this decision was made. - It was quickly adopted, but the decision was difficult. To surrender... Well, I wouldn't allow myself to do that. You can't give up in this life at all. If we are detected, there is time to live for 3 seconds while the fuse burns. - You've seen them search for you. - Literally 7 meters away, we observed one, he passed in one direction, in the other ... And artillery strikes began in this place. I believe it was our artillery that worked on them. It saved our lives. Because it scared them away, they walked away. We decided to wait until dark. Wet through for five hours, they lie in the bushes, not moving, waiting for dusk. Surprisingly, men do not shake from the cold. Apparently, the release of adrenaline and the effect of an anesthetic affect. All this time, somewhere nearby, enemy reconnaissance is scurrying, artillery explosions are heard, sprinkling the wounded with earth and fragments on the flight. In the late afternoon, the cannonade subsides. The navigator says, ""I have a spine, I can't get up."" Peter replies, ""Nicholas, we have to go. It's going to be hard, but it's going to go."" And they go unharvested fields, hiding in the thickets of sunflower and corn. 7-10-15 minutes of walking, 2 minutes of rest - Dmitry's injury constantly makes itself felt. Remember, as in Polevoy: ""And he decided to go, to go east, to go through the forest, not trying to look for convenient roads and living places, to go, no matter what it takes ... It seemed that the weaker and more weak his body became, the more stubborn and stronger his spirit was. In 13 hours, they overcame about 30 kilometers. - We have come to a populated area. ""Come on, stay here and I'll go see who's there in the village,"" I tell the navigator. And then they noticed a technique with the letter Z. ""Everything, Nikolaich, is one hundred percent ours."" They came to the first house, noticed my grandfather: ""Father, are there Any Russian troops here?"" He said: ""Yes, men, I will take it away now."" I said, ""Can I have a drink?"" He gave us water. I wanted to drink all the way. - Grandpa took you to someone. - To our gunners. We went into one hangar, the driver-mechanic came out, and he took us to the battalion at the headquarters. They have already contacted ours and reported their whereabouts. - How the male gunners met you. -Very well. They also, of course, heard that such a situation had occurred, and it is not known where the crew is. And when we went out to them, we were surprised, of course. But they accepted well, immediately fed. And then a helicopter flew after us. - Who was the first to be seen when he stepped out of the helicopter. -Commander. He reported on the completion of the task, the commander hugged: ""Thank you, guys, for being alive."" Well, then there is the hospital, treatment and awarding. - I was happy with the award. - I was confused rather. I still don't realize what I did so heroically. The country rated it that way. I will carry this high title with dignity. - Not only have you completed a combat mission and returned from it. You pulled out your comrade-in-arms, brought him home. - I didn't revert it, we went together. We acted as a coordinated mechanism, as a crew. That's the situation. We did what we were taught. - Okay, so they did. I remembered the teachers with a kind word. -Of course. My first instructor pilot had already been called. I am grateful to all the instructors who put young boys on the wing in the training regiments. This is worth a lot, they have a very large and responsible job. But Pyotr Kashtanov became a pilot only because of his perseverance. He was drawn to the sky from a young age. My mother said that they lived near the airfield. And four-year-old Peter loved to watch how every day planes took off above him and the domes of parachutes opened in the air. That's when he said that he would definitely become a pilot, although he himself does not remember it. After the 9th grade, he entered a boarding school in Tambov with initial flight training. Everything is like in the army: a company, a platoon, a barracks position, outfits... And when I graduated, I went to flight school. Only enrolled as much as the fifth time. One discipline was not given. During this time, he even served a term as a tanker. But he did not give up the dream of heaven: ""If I take on something, I will bring it to the end."" First flight. - Delight and admiration. This cannot be conveyed, because in principle, it is not characteristic of a person to fly. And that's for life. - And who was your reference point. - Maresyev, of course. This is the well-known story of a man who crawled, because his legs were broken, to his own. And he also had a dream – to fly. And he achieved this – he flew without legs. - And you plan to return to the sky. -Of course! Now treatment and recovery. And then at the helm of the aircraft, the best in the world - Su-34. - Now the young boys will read, they will also want to become pilots. What qualities you need to cultivate in yourself. - Persistence is unequivocal. Patience is everything has its time, as they say. The main thing in aviation is to always be honest.

But just in case, he prepared a ""fish"", in which he outlined the main ""pain points"" of the Special Military Operation that bother ... No, not the military. Purely military topics seemed inappropriate to me for the HRC. They are quite frankly discussed in a different, non-public format. I made the top three complaints from the relatives of our fighters who write to me in telegram. And that's dozens of messages every day. The composition of the HRC is impressive. But the president's schedule is limited. And only half of the Council was able to speak, which, however, raised really important topics. What I wanted to say. LINK TO THE FRONT. So, 70 percent of people who contact me start with the words ""Help me find a husband/son/brother."" As a rule, we are talking about the mobilized. These are people who have already gone through all the instances, but could not find out where their relative is and what is wrong with him: ""It does not appear on bad lists,"" the Ministry of Defense replies. But the mother's heart cannot be soothed by this. And women are looking for support among journalists, who have even fewer opportunities to find out the whereabouts of the mobilized. At the same time, the problem is solved elementarily, there are examples of high-quality work of the command of the units with relatives, when both letters and parcels can be transmitted through the point of permanent deployment. They are taken to the front by their own transport and handed over to the fighters personally in their hands. But this, unfortunately, is not a systematic approach. At the same time, 80 years ago, at any end of the country, a person could put his letter in a box and be sure that it would reach the front. And there will be an answer. Before the war, our country was called the most reading in the world. During the war, she became the most written. During the four years of the Great Patriotic War, postmen delivered 10.7 billion triangles, postcards, secrets to recipients... Our field mail address was announced only for the tenth month of the conflict. It remains to be hoped that it will work without failures. PAYMENTS. In second place is the issue of non-payment. There are cases when volunteers do not receive any money for four months. Here's an example so that this problem doesn't look like a dry protocol string. ""I am the wife of the mobilized Oleg Chertov. The husband was drafted on September 29, and on October 6 he was already in the LPR. For two months, he did not receive a penny at all. I turned and wrote wherever I could, there is still no answer from anywhere. We have a large family of two adults and four schoolchildren, one of the children is disabled."" - Wait, how was he even drafted with so many children? You tried to challenge the mobilization. ""My husband loves his homeland and did not hide behind the children,"" the woman simply replies to me. Understand? She does not ask her husband to return home because he can return to the family by law. She only needs something to support the children, while the father defends the Fatherland. To be fair, there are no mass complaints about non-payment. But such appeals come regularly. Including from civilians. I was in Kherson when the evacuation was announced from this city. And, unfortunately, there were cases when people left for big Russia, but a week later they returned, unable to withstand the press of the bureaucracy. Soulless formalism can finish anyone off. What can we say about people with a shattered psyche, who are traveling from hostilities, but stumble upon bureaucratic arbitrariness. ""We were given a certificate (for housing). Neither my husband nor I received the promised 100,000. They also did not receive social assistance,"" writes the Ivanov couple, who received Russian citizenship in Kherson and voted in a referendum for a new life. - We are both pensioners. Pensions were also not given to us either for October or November. In Kherson, we were given a pension of 10,000 until September."" EQUIPMENT AND CARING. The third is equipment. In some places, it is still lacking. Especially in winter. And some relatives complain that you even have to take a loan to buy your husband a high-quality warm uniform. Its lack is not always the head-scratching of the rearguards. Although it is present. It's just that many units live in harsh field conditions, where camouflage wears out very quickly. And according to the charter, a set of summer and winter uniforms per year is required? So don't ask for more. And the fighters have to turn to volunteers, then to journalists, then to relatives. At the same time, I noticed a pattern a long time ago. If in the unit the commander is initiative and not indifferent, then everything is in order with his equipment, and with communication with relatives, and with products in positions. There are excellent examples of interaction between the military and regional authorities, and there is complete indifference. That's where the problems come in. Which, however, are already an order of magnitude less than at the initial stage of mobilization. EVERYTHING WILL BE BROUGHT TO FRUITION. Unfortunately, my turn did not reach me. However, all these problems with specific specific examples from the HRC will be brought to the attention of the president. Or solved manually through the relevant departments. In the end, it is possible to determine the suitability for service of a person with an introvertebral Schmorl hernia that requires surgical intervention (the documents are in my hands) without the participation of the president. If you approach the soldier in a human way, and not formally. LISTEN AS WELL. Karen Shakhnazarov: For both the West and Russia, the defeat in Ukraine threatens with very serious consequences (more)"

Having assessed the situation, despite the superior forces of the militants, it was decided to impose the battle on the enemy. Competently located on the positions, the Russian military suddenly opened a heavy fire on the militants. During the battle, Dmitry, conducting targeted fire, suppressed the enemy's mortar crew. During the return fire from the enemy, Dmitry Prytkov was wounded, however, overcoming the pain, he continued to fight with the nationalists. As a result of the battle, Russian servicemen killed more than 7 militants. The surviving nationalists retreated."" HE GAVE A MASTER CLASS OF COUNTER-BATTERY WRESTLING. Ensign Mikhail UNGURYAN. ""The sergeant major of the artillery battery, Ensign Mihail Ungureanu, carried out a combat mission to support the advancing units with artillery fire. After firing another salvo, the battery proceeded to change its firing position. The enemy, seeking to deprive our troops of artillery support, attacked the positions of the battery, opening mortar fire on the moving column. Acting courageously and decisively, without losing his temper, Mikhail quickly navigated the situation and brought the gun into a combat position and prepared to conduct a counter-battery struggle. Thanks to the operational reconnaissance carried out by the operator of the drone, the enemy's firing position was revealed, from where the mortar was fired. While conducting and correcting the fire of the gun, Ensign Ungureanu destroyed the enemy's foreign-made mortar. Also, Ensign Ungureanu carried wounded colleagues out of enemy fire and gave them first aid, which saved their lives."" LISTEN AS WELL. Will Volgograd be renamed Stalingrad?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4689248/,Roman GOLOVANOV,2022-12-08,"The prophecies of elder Zosima, the Russian hero and the torture cellars of the SBU. What is happening in Donbas","The new region of Russia was told by the special correspondent ""KP"", the host of the Orthodox TV channel ""Spas"" Roman Golovanov, who went to Mariupol and Donetsk with the famous political scientist Sergei Mikheev, who is making a film about the meanings and goals of the special operation","When you enter the Donbas land, your heart flutters. You're back home. We are on the way to Mariupol. Dawn spreads across the endless fields outside the window. A demining service is working on the roadsides. They collect the ""harvest"". Without sappers, sowing cannot begin. By the way, the road to Marik is the highest class. The asphalt was laid in the best Moscow style. No Europe ever dreamed of. Ukraine was flooded with money to pull up the roads to the European level. But everything happened in Ukrainian traditions – the money was squandered, and the war will write everything off. Mariupol meets the dead-high-rise buildings. Burned. Crippled. Collapsed from art duels. The farther you go, the scarier. The first floors break the heart with inscriptions: ""Here are the children! Lord save and have mercy!"" or ""Here they live."" On the stalls and shops there are ads: ""There is an owner."" In the air hangs the memory of hunger and horror that people experienced here. The very center is Prospekt Mira. Only there was no peace here... But nothing. We will rebuild the martyr city. Back and forth goes a giant string of trucks on Russian license plates. Excavators demolish buildings that cannot be restored. New ones will be built in their place. We remove the city center from the copter. A man comes up and asks, ""Guys, you can fly out that window. There's my apartment. Look what's out there. You can't go in."" Fly the drone into a broken window. No apartment. Partitions were destroyed. The man nodded his head, thanked him and left. From another window, a burnt icon of Sergius of Radonezh looks at us. Crossed. We drove into the former SBU building. Damn place. It blows cold. Darkness. We are greeted by Father Theophanes. Under ukrainian rule, he was taken hostage for his association with the Russians. They handcuffed them so tightly that my hands still can't feel anything. They beat me for hours. With him we go down to the dark basement. Former shooting gallery. ""They were tied to this chair,"" the priest says casually. ""They poured water, strangled, shot overhead from afar. If you're lucky, you'll survive. They beat me with this heavy drill bit. So that the meat moved away from the bones. A friend of mine was left disabled after that. They took for Russian books. For Russian phone numbers. Not much ceremony. Someone knocked and you were accepted. - Father Theophanes, why did this happen? –Ask. - Our disease is ""khataskrainism"". It doesn't concern me. I won't climb. In the end, it covered everyone. Yes, we have a lot to think about in the rear. Learn from other people's mistakes, our ""khataskrayniki"". Not far from the SBU building, their cub is the Azov base. Animals were cooked here under the auspices of special services. There was a pagan temple on the territory. The ""Azov people"" offered a sacrifice to evil spirits. When the Orthodox army arrived, the temple was burned. There is nothing to tarnish the Russian land with demons. You get to Azovstal by the bridge. There are burnt and smoked cars scattered here. Knocked out equipment. Here's a tank that didn't have time to be taken away. At the entrance to the enterprise there is a huge sign: ""Caution! Mines!"" Three and a half months of fighting and shelling. Constantly something explodes and bangs. It's hard to imagine how long it will take to clear this. The impression is grim. Oppressive. But put aside decadence. The city is Russian. We're not going anywhere from here. The port is already operational. The technique plows. In a few years, there will be no trace of the war. Only these archival photos and the museum of atrocities of the SBU. And we turn to Donetsk. There are fighters waiting for us on the front lines. Who would have thought that in Mariupol you will feel safer than in the center of Donetsk. At first glance, a typical Russian city. Cars are waiting for a green light at traffic lights. People are walking on the sidewalks. The lights are on in the windows. It is not boiling, but there is a measured life. And then there was the rumble of artillery strikes. From the direction of Avdiivka, which has not yet been liberated, they are hitting the city. In response, our air defense works. They take revenge, bastards, that they are being dismantled in the Donetsk direction. The big trouble of Donetsk is that there is no water. You pull the tap back and forth: deaf. To understand. Try to give up at least for a day from water in the apartment. Get a full bath. That's the whole stock. Wash the dishes, the children, go to the toilet, excuse me. ""Tomorrow they promise to give water, let's wash,"" one of the guests of our hotel is reassuring. Moving on foot in Donetsk, you always look under your feet. You walk only on asphalt, without stepping on the lawn. Somewhere else there were mines scattered by Ukrainian artillery - ""petals"". If you step on it, say goodbye to your ankle-length leg. By the way, when you return from Donbass, the local habit of moving carefully is preserved for at least another day. Children often mistook the ""petals"" for a toy and were blown up on them. Aleya Angelov – the children who died in Donbas – is not discussed at the UN meeting. After all, these are the wrong children who can be maimed and killed. Then I was told a painfully familiar story. ""In Moscow, the boy Roman and his mother Tatiana are in the hospital. They are from the liberated territory. Dills hit them in the summer with direct fire. Tatyana said that she saw how the dryers rolled out the cannon, aimed. And this is the private sector. Children were running around the house, women on the benches were gutari. Roma's arm was completely torn off. By the grace of God, they did the operation, everything was collected back, then there was a soft tissue transplant, and then the skin ... Roma's lens fell out of one eye from the explosion and some of the protein leaked out. There will still be an operation on the eyes..... At dawn we leave in the direction of the legendary and long-suffering Donetsk airport. There stands the Iversky Monastery-Martyr of the Donbass Elder Zosima Sokur. Back in the 90s, my father predicted the return of the Nazis: ""When I die, bury me deeper, so that the Banderaites do not dig up."" They thought the old man was blessed. It turned out to prophesy our present life. We drive a bead into the ""gray zone"". There's always something whistling and whistling over your head. The shelling does not stop for a second. ""We need to put on protective equipment,"" the escort officer commands. We took out our helmets. They threw on the armor. And next to us is a grandmother in a bodysuit. No armored vehicles or helmets. Here's her house. He's not going to give it up. From the outside, you might think that the Iversky Temple does not work from bombing and destruction. Wrong. There's a service going on there. Even some people came to pray. Here you understand everything about the metaphysics of this conflict. The West put Ukraine not against Russia, but against God. Demons are shaking from Orthodox churches. He is rooted in the return of holy Russia. Sold the birthright. ... It is impossible to stay in one place for a long time. American satellites and Turkish drones calculate the target quickly and Ukrainian artillery begins to work on it. And the goal is you. We drive closer to Donetsk airport. We jump out of the car with political scientist Sergei Mikheev. We came with him to make a film and make sense of this war. We approach the point of shooting. And then 150 meters from us arrives. Something of a 155-gauge. Arta. Whether it's a coincidence. Or spotted. It doesn't matter anymore. Fly into the bead. Gas to the floor. We move to the base of the battalion ""Rus"". In their area of responsibility are the Sands. ""Guys, take off your armor, let's go drink tea,"" the kombat ""Rusi"", a lieutenant colonel with the call sign ""Abkhazia"", greets us. A major Russian hero. Smiling and kind. Outside, the ground is shaking with tears. And next to our warriors quietly and calmly. More peaceful than ever. All anxieties dissolve in their composure and confidence. Most of them are volunteers. Here, in addition to the barracks, weapons and canteen, a temple was built on the front line. A small room for prayer. Military priest Roman Zayats gathered us and the soldiers for a prayer service. Each soldier has a candle in his hand. We pray for the living and the dead. We pray for our victory. This is the immortal regiment. When the spiritually living and the dead stand in the same order. ""We will definitely win, there is no other option,"" the battalion commander says after the prayer. You believe him. And again you are filled with tranquility. A little later, the violinist Piotr Lundström, who was native to the raspolaga, arrived at the raspolaga. He brought musician friends who were on the front lines for the first time. And Peter himself is a regular guest here. Not even a guest, his own. We gather with the fighters in the largest room. Lundström plays Bach. Something incredible is happening. Mystical. Unreal. Prayer and music block the rumble of Ukrainian art. Everyone thickens, no one twitches or boils. At sunset we left Donetsk in the direction of Rostov. The city saw off cannon rolls. Live, native Donetsk. You're going to win. You suffered this victory. READ ALSO. Mobilized men in the trenches say: ""We want to attack!""

Utilities are updating the fleet of snow removal equipment and connecting houses to gas pipelines,"Recall that the ""gas issue"" arose acutely in early July. On the 8th, hundreds of thousands of Zaporozhye residents discovered that there was no gas in their homes. It soon became clear that the pipeline itself was intact. It was just blocked by the Ukrainian side. At the same time, the nationalists were not embarrassed that the resource was lost and the villages even in the territory controlled by them. Thus, more than 225 thousand houses of the Zaporozhye region, in which about half a million people live, at one point were left without an important resource. It became impossible for people to even cook food. The authorities of the region immediately turned to Russia for support. The reaction was immediate. It was decided to lay a new gas pipeline instead of the blocked one, which will stretch from Berdyansk to Melitopol. And during the work, residents of the region were provided with electric stoves, reducing electricity tariffs to a minimum in cities where there was no gas. To date, work to restore gas supply in the region continues. According to Alexander Gomonov, Deputy Minister of Industry and Energy of the Zaporizhzhya region, by now more than 90 thousand families receive gas again, and every day it returns to 3- 4 thousand households. All this is due to the connection of the region to the unified gas transmission system of the Russian Federation. Thus, the supply of blue fuel was resumed in Berdyansk, Melitopol districts, Tokmak and Enerhodar are on the line. - Yes, we have gas! - confirmed a resident of Berdyansk Nikolai Prytko. - We live like white people. And in Berdyansk, the Eternal Flame came to life again, which, due to the colossal increase in gas prices in Ukraine, had to be extinguished, replacing the live flame with a video installation. - The eternal flame at the memorial complex was lit with the resumption of gas supply. We remember our past and confidently build our bright future, - commented the chairman of the movement ""We are together with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov. In turn, the acting governor of the Zaporizhzhya region Yevhen Balitsky also commented on the situation with gas supply, in particular, he spoke in detail about what is happening in Melitopol. - The phased connection of settlements to gas supply continues. In Melitopol, gas has already been supplied. The connection of schools, hospitals, multi-apartment and private sector of Melitopol has begun. Pressure is being created on Tokmak and Enerhodar, settlements that will be connected as follows. I am grateful to the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, our specialists, who in a short time in difficult conditions provide the residents of the region with gas and heat. The heating season in the Zaporizhzhya region is going according to plan, - Yevgeny Balitsky wrote in the telegram channel. THAT TIME. Utility tariffs have been reduced. After working out the algorithm for payment for housing and communal services, tariffs were formed for electricity, water supply, sanitation, transportation and consumption of natural gas, as well as for centralized heat supply. Thus, the following tariffs apply in the region. the payment for heating decreased from 2745.5 rubles. per Gcal to 1160.33 rubles. per Gcal. the tariff for hot water supply changed from 157.19 rubles per cubic meter to 77.67 rubles per cubic meter. m. the fee for cold water supply decreased from 32.69 rubles. per cubic meter. m to 25.02 rubles. per cubic meter. m. the tariff for water disposal decreased from 31.5 rubles. per cubic meter. m to 11.61 rubles. per cubic meter. m."

The centers have made the lives of Russians easier, saving them from wasting time in queues for some certificate, document or public service. In Russia, everyone knows that through the employees of the MFC offices, on the principle of one window, you can submit documents to social protection, the Pension Fund, city departments and many other departments. Moreover, already 99 percent of services are available in any ""My Documents"" center, regardless of the place of registration. In the near future, this system will fully include new regions - the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Moreover, the beginning has already been laid. On November 25, the first such center opened in Kherson Henichesk, 10 centers are on the way in the LPR, at least one will open before the end of the year in the Zaporozhye region, and in the DPR the unified registration centers working here began to be transformed into MFCs in the spring of this year. To date, there are 27 such centers in the republic. Their specialists can help to order a medical policy, make state registration of rights to real estate, conduct a technical inventory, get confirmation of civil status records, permits for the division of property, legalize title documents, issue duplicates of various documents and certificates from the notarial archive, and so on. But, in order for the services provided to residents to be of higher quality, the employees of the new centers should have the same set of competencies as their colleagues in other regions of the country. By the way, the mechanism for selecting future specialists in the MFC system is quite strict - this is the study of resumes, interviews and the approved procedure for test tests, ranging from primary tests to assess the general cultural level and erudition of applicants. They pass tests in the Russian language and speech literacy, tests on knowledge of information technology and the use of office programs, tests on knowledge of the basics of relevant legislation. There is also a test on communicative abilities, which allows you to assess the ability of a future specialist to communicate with people, listen and hear any interlocutor. The staff of the MFC is selected in such a way that it includes both established specialists and young people. That the life and professional experience of some combined with creativity and the ability to new ideas of others give the best results. The centers have a system of continuous professional development of employees: they constantly monitor changes in legislation, the regulatory framework, the emergence of new services, etc. Because MFC specialists must equally competently provide all types of services. On November 23, in the capital of the Chernozem region, Voronezh, with the support of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF), the first shift of the training program for specialists of the MFC of the LDNR ""One Window of a Big Country"" was launched. The program was developed by social activists and the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) of the Russian Federation with the support of the Presidential Grants Foundation. As the Governor of the Voronezh Region Alexander Gusev noted, it is especially important for the presidential movement to interact with the employees of the MFC, since they work with the population on a daily basis. The All-Russia People's Front, in turn, monitors the integration of territories into the legal space of the Russian Federation. - It is important for us to be in constant contact with the employees of the MFC. Due to this, we receive important feedback, see what decisions are stalled, and we can timely draw the attention of the Russian government, responsible ministries and departments to this, ""explained Mikhail Kuznetsov, head of the executive committee of the Popular Front. As part of the first field session, 60 specialists will be trained in Voronezh. Experts from Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Moscow, Rostov, Tula and Ulyanovsk regions will share their experience with them. - The program is designed for a year and will be held in several stages. During this time, hundreds of specialists from four new regions of Russia will participate in field sessions, visit advanced MFCs, and study the best practices of colleagues from all over Russia. They will be given access to online lectures, training videos and methodological materials, the All-Russia People's Front commented. Subsequently, specialists from Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions will also join the program. As a result of the project, more than a thousand universal specialists will be trained and educated. - MFCs of Russia have come a long way, the result of which was the creation of a client-centric and dynamically developing network that meets all modern trends and needs of citizens. We are confident that the project implemented by the Popular Front will help our colleagues to quickly and effectively start creating a network of IGSCs,"" said Elena Kazmerchuk, Director of the Department for Ensuring the Quality of Public Services to the Population and Performing State Functions of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation."

Denis Pushilin, acting head of the DPR, said that the Mariupol port is used as a hub for the delivery of goods. In this capacity, the port will be able to work at full capacity after solving all legislative issues. Also, the head of the DPR said that a new one will be built on the site of the old port. Construction will begin in 2023, but in the meantime, work is being completed on demining the territory and preparing technical documentation. The port of Mariupol began to work on October 7. It is supposed to be used for the export of grain, coal, metal. Those sitting in Azovstal and Bankova hoped that this would never happen. The exploits of the heroes of the SVO will be included in the history books. The combat achievements of the Russian heroes of the SVO will be included in history textbooks. Such information came from the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation. More than four dozen officers, sergeants and soldiers of the Russian army and Rosgvardia received the title of Heroes of Russia after the start of the special operation. And the brave act of each of them is worthy of generations of Russian schoolchildren to know about it. Ukrainian punishers use Czech artillery. During the shelling of the Voroshilov district of Donetsk, the Armed Forces of Ukraine used MLRS RM-70. Kiev received them from Prague. The Joint Center for Control and Coordination of Issues Related to War Crimes of Ukraine (JCCC) reported: ""Military experts of the JCCC of the DPR confirmed the fact of shelling of the Voroshilov district of Donetsk from positions near the village of Tonenkoe. The enemy fired with the use of MLRS RM-70 caliber 122 mm, transferred by the Czech Republic. The purpose of the shelling by the armed formations of Ukraine is to destroy the social infrastructure of the republic."" After the shelling, damage was recorded at 14 addresses. It was recorded, among other things, a direct hit on the building of the educational and practical computer center and damage in the building of the Faculty of Philology of Donetsk National University. Kiev still believes that this is its land and its people. Mercenaries are crushed like bedbugs, foreign weapons - too. The strikes of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation hit the point of temporary deployment of foreign mercenaries near the village of Borovske in the Kharkiv region. Polish crying again. Well, as a result of the strike on the point of restoration of the equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Kharkov, the MLRS ""HIMARS"" and 48 rockets to it were smashed. And in Kryvyi Rih, more than 70 missiles of the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system and two MLRS launchers were destroyed. Four more similar installations received critical damage. Among those who served them, too, not all are subjects of Zelensky. Whoever comes to us with MLRS will die under it. The SBU burns Orthodoxy in the middle of nowhere. The SBU continues ""counterintelligence activities"" at the facilities of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Inspections were held in the Assumption Cathedral in Kherson, in Uman, in the Assumption Cathedral in the Cherkasy region, in the Mykolaiv Miletsky Monastery of the Vladimir-Volyn diocese, at other facilities of the UOC. Earlier, the SBU conducted the same ""counterintelligence activities"" in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, two other monasteries and the Sarnensky diocese in the Rivne region. More than fifty people were interrogated and ""pro-Russian literature"" was found. According to Metropolitan Anthony, these were Easter messages of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia. The SBU also searched UOC facilities in Poltava, Zhytomyr, Rivne and Transcarpathian regions. They should read the Old and New Testaments, study in more detail what is said about the Day of Judgment. Yes, apparently, concerns about the safety of the self do not allow to be distracted by trifles. How much does the Armed Forces of Ukraine pay for a Russian sapper. Sappers of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet, participating in the SVO, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting a real hunt for them. One of the sappers, who arrived at the special operation zone as a volunteer, reported that in a month and a half he had made more than 15 combat sorties and explained that there he and his colleagues were mainly engaged not in mine clearance, but in the destruction of mines on the spot. And often you have to perform your duties under fire. He added that for each sapper killed, the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""are paid a bonus of five thousand US dollars - such conversations go on in the troops. The sapper makes a mistake once, and the one who hunts for the sapper. The Ukrainian General Staff was concerned about parental rights. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in its operational report on the SVO reported that in the settlements of the Kherson region ""threats of deprivation of parental rights force the local population to send children to educational institutions under the Russian program."" Deputy Minister of Education of the Kherson region Tatyana Kuzmich said: ""Since our region is one of the subjects of Russia, the training is conducted according to Russian educational programs and standards. No one forces children to go to school. Parents voluntarily come and write applications for admission of a child to school. Parents are not threatened and are not going to be deprived of parental rights."" According to her, a similar wave of disinformation was in mid-August, and now it has risen again. The wave is raised by those who do not drown. Officials in Kiev dream of hitting Siberia. The Financial Times, citing an ""unnamed adviser to the Ukrainian authorities on defense issues,"" reported that in Kiev, after strikes on Russian airfields near Saratov, Ryazan and Kursk, they threaten attacks on other Russian facilities, including beyond the Urals. This source said: ""We have no restrictions on the distance. Soon we will be able to achieve any goals on the territory of Russia, including in Siberia."" Such drone attacks will not help Kiev win, but they can affect Ukraine's ""influence operations"" on the territory of the Russian Federation, which ""the West does not want to support."" I wonder if these people read anything other than the alphabet and the latest textbook of Ukrainian history?"

Honest answers of a person who has been to all the ""hot spots"" on the contact line are in our material. - That rare case when you can catch you in the editorial office after February 24. For a long time to Moscow. - Before the New Year, for sure, a lot of household chores have accumulated, workers, recently I am a member of the Human Rights Council under the President, this also imposes duties. It is necessary to delve into this work, which, in principle, I am familiar with, because for nine months I had to face the problems of people in uniform. And as far as possible, some even decide. - What are the main problems you face. - The first is the equipment. And not always this problem is due to the thuggery of the command. People were normally equipped, for example, they were brought to the forest, they live in the forest, and there are harsh conditions. And the uniform wears out quickly. KamAZ comes under fire with supplies, burns everything that was in it. Or they gave something away initially, but it got lost in the fight. Sometimes the negligence of the rear guards. There are complaints and questions about the promised money, especially among volunteers. There are a lot of appeals from relatives who are looking for their sons and husbands. Here he was not in touch for a month, and his relatives are already panicking. I understand that in the zone of a special operation, the military may not get in touch for months, there are places from where it is simply impossible to call. But the mother or wife cannot be reassured by this. Moreover, until recently, we did not have field mail as a class. In the Great Patriotic War, postmen delivered almost 11 billion letters from home to the front and back. After 80 years, for some reason, this has become a problem. The Ministry of Defense has published an address to which you can send letters and parcels. We'll see how it works. - Do you have a feeling that the situation, one way or another, is changing for the better? Or not. - Negative examples are the loudest, and there are fewer of them than positive ones. Over the past two and a half months, I have met with those mobilized in the Kherson direction, in Zaporozhye, on the Svatovsky frontier. I was not taken to special exemplary places, I chose and drove to the ""front"". I met the salt of the Russian land, our usual men, former locksmiths, builders, IT specialist I came across alone. And, in principle, they, of course, are not so directly tactically dressed and equipped, but normally provided with uniforms, live in difficult but tolerable conditions. No one on the ""front"" will create conditions for you. You create them for yourself. - You once wrote: ""Do not pay attention to the difficulties you are facing.... - It is difficult not to pay attention. A man comes from a civilian, and then he shovels in his teeth - and knee-deep in water swarm a trench for himself. And make drainage ditches... And I just looked at these guys, a lump came to my throat with pride: people only from civilian life are pulled out, thrown into this inferno, and they do not lose their spirit, sense of humor. They display marvels of bravery, courage and precision. Two guys mobilized from the Tambov region were especially sunk into my soul. For three weeks they were trained as a calculation of the Malka gun of 203 millimeters. And they are now on the front line, on the Matchmaking Frontier. Every day they destroy the enemy's equipment. Clearly, accurately, according to the coordinates that intelligence gives them. Their commander calls them ""jewelers."" These are guys who once upon a time served military service, completely unrelated to artillery. This suggests that at the training ground they had high-quality training, a normal commander. And he taught them to shoot from this huge caterpillar colossus. Yes, they live in the forest, in camping conditions, but they are provided with rubber boots, raincoats, thermal underwear. That's what the commander knocked out for them. They fight with desire. - What an atmosphere on the front lines. - People want to go forward. They say, ""We're tired of sitting in the trenches."" I talked to the guys in the Kherson direction even before we left there, and they say: ""Well, what mood can there be? People in Russia expect some victories and feats from us, but we have been standing in the forest for several months. We want to advance."" At the same time, there is an understanding that before the start of mobilization, there was actually nothing to go to. Because in the spring and summer we advanced for a long time, lost people, equipment, and there was nowhere to make up for it. Now the industry is working, and in many areas the situation has been stabilized. At the same Svatov frontier, the mobilized played their part. They hold their ground. They shoot from ""Malok"" and ""Tulips"", ride tanks. And this has not yet come the bulk of the conscripts from the reserve, which is undergoing in-depth training. There is a slow, but still progress in the direction of Artemovsk (Bakhmut). This is a very important story, because there Ukraine spends most of its artillery reserves, there Kiev is now suffering the greatest losses in manpower, and it is for the Donbass front that the battle for Bakhmut may turn out to be a turning point. The task is not just to take the city, but also to destroy as much manpower and equipment of the enemy as possible, since he allows you to do this, does not take into account any losses. The nature of the hostilities is such that Ukraine suffers losses many times greater than ours. But let's not be disingenuous, they're on a roll right now. They are trying to transfer reserves from the Kherson direction to Svatovo and Zaporozhye - that is, they threaten us with breakthroughs both there and there. Ukrainian artillery fires more per day than the Americans in Afghanistan in a month. This cannot go on forever. Sooner or later, the Ukrainian troops should begin to decline - because of losses, because of the lack of ammunition. - Let's start from the words of the same adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Arestovich, who says that the Russians are running out of shells and missiles. He's pressing on what? The Russians are still bombing us with the ""Soviet legacy."" What do you say to that. - Are we fighting with the ""Soviet legacy""? Including. What's wrong with that? Thank you for having it. And they're fighting. - That's good or bad. - That's a given. It's too bad we don't have systems like France's Caesar yet. It is bad that we do not yet have analogues of the American ""Hymars"". There is no low-orbit satellite constellation... But I know that there are developments, I will not say from which ""Soviet heritage"", which in their characteristics will surpass the ""Khaymars"". And we have the ability to do a lot of them, these systems are already being tested in combat conditions, but have not yet been supplied en masse. - You will go to the front after the New Year, you have what expectations. - High expectations usually make you frustrated. Therefore, I am just going to continue to work, to talk about people who fight, treat wounds, help with humanitarian aid. For me, a special operation is first and foremost about fate. This year I was on a business trip for 8 months out of 12. I talked about dozens of characters, both in uniform and without. - Adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Podolyak, said that in six months they will take the Crimea. What do you say? We should be afraid of this. - There is no need to be afraid, we must understand that they keep it in mind and in all seriousness. It's not a crazy statement by a city madman, they really have it in their plans. And I will tell you that if we had not launched a special operation, they would have started a war against Donbass and crushed it. I'm sure of it personally. Just crushed by quantity. And on the courage they would go further to the Crimea. And heavy fighting would ensue. And what is happening now in the territories of Ukraine and new Russian regions would happen in Crimea. If now, in the winter campaign, they succeed in an offensive operation, for example, in the Zaporozhye direction, they can cut our group and reach the border with Crimea. Therefore, it is no coincidence that powerful defensive lines are being built there now. This means that we calculate all scenarios. - The winter campaign is still more of a revival of hostilities or, conversely, it will be such a trench confrontation. - It's a change in the nature of the fighting. If there is a warm winter, then there is no need to wait for any great activity using heavy equipment. At the same time, if we recall the campaign of the beginning of this year - yes, in February there were still frosts, when we came to Kiev, the equipment calmly went to the Kharkiv direction ... 2015, January - Donetsk airport was taken, despite any weather conditions. Debaltseve was taken. And how did they fight in the Great Patriotic War? They didn't pause for the winter. The main thing is that the industry should reach the turn when it will be able to supply some equipment to the troops online every day. - It has already been stated that our military-industrial complex works in three shifts. - Yes, yes, I know, we are doing very well on Kalibr, we are making up for Iskanders very well. But we also need modern tanks, gun barrels, because the wear is terrible. Here in Lugansk I have a friend, the commander of the cannon division, they were given the fourth guns to the Hyacinths in these 9 months. -Ok. As for the equipment. There were complaints in the beginning, how do you assess it now. - Like the barrels, the equipment is also very seriously worn out in the field. I repeat, where the commander is initiative, where he treats the personnel normally, where he understands that the fulfillment of the combat mission will depend on how his fighters will be equipped, everything is normal there. If it is not possible to knock something out of the rear, he looks for ways out to volunteers, to sponsors. There are examples of excellent interaction between business and the army, regional authorities and the army. I'm not going to name anyone right now so that I'm not accused of bias. But there are great examples. INSTEAD OF THE FINAL. Who does time work for. - Last question. Who does time work for if hostilities continue in one way or another in a global sense. - Now time is playing on us. Ukraine has an inexhaustible mobilization resource, we called for 300 thousand, and they will call, conditionally, a million. But by this time, I hope our 300,000 will have been qualitatively trained and equipped, armed, and provided with equipment. And the enemy will still have problems with equipment and ammunition in the near future one way or another. With a cavalry charge we will not drive the enemy to the western border. But some kind of turning point, I think, still in the winter campaign in our direction should happen. Maybe in the next month."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690507/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-08,Expert opinion: Ukrainian army expects a crushing blow that will crush it,"Why, after the difficult autumn months, the situation on the fronts in the SVO zone is slowly but steadily changing in the right direction","Despite the bravura statements of Zelensky and his generals about the alleged successes of the armed formations of ukraine on the fronts in the south and east, the situation is not at all in favor of the Kiev regime. Allied forces are slowly but surely squeezing the enemy out of his positions in the Donbass. Russian artillery and aviation are disabling equipment and warehouses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only behind the front line, but also on distant approaches. Here are the objective data of the end of autumn. They are. On November 25, in the South-Donetsk direction, with the help of accurate strikes by Russian artillery, attempts by the armed forces of Ukraine to attack in the direction of Vladimirovka, Pavlovka and Vremyevka in the DPR were thwarted. The Russian Aerospace Forces launched an airstrike on Ukrainian positions in Ugledar. And Russian artillery hit enemy targets in Prichestivka and Vremyevka. Only in one day, Ukrainian formations lost more than half a company in this direction dead and wounded. In the Donetsk direction, Russian forces destroyed the set targets in Avdiivka, the western outskirts of Marinka, Krasnohorivka and Pervomaisk. In Avdiivka, from where they continue to shell Donetsk, purposeful work is underway. The most trained units mobilized in late September and early October are already participating in it. In the Kharkiv region, the Russian Armed Forces worked on Ukrainian positions in Strelechya, Krasny, Zeleny, Staritsa, Ogurtsov and Volchansk. A high-precision strike destroyed up to 200 militants in the zone of deployment of Polish mercenaries in the region. In the Starobilsk direction, Russian troops struck at concentrations of enemy manpower and equipment in Dvurechnaya, Berestovoye, Makiivka, Stelmakhovka and Torsky. In the Bakhmut (Artemovsky) direction, the Russian Armed Forces hit targets in Bakhmut, Bakhmut, Andreevka and Verkhnekamenskoye. On the night of November 25, the Russian Armed Forces struck at an enemy facility in the vicinity of Zaporozhye. Targets in Olgovsky, Gulyaipolsky and Charivny were also hit. In the southern sector of the front, the Russian Armed Forces inflicted massive strikes on the objects of the Ukrainian army in Kherson, Berislav, Chernobaivka, Belozerka and Veletensky. According to Konstantin Sivkov, Deputy President of the Russian Academy of Missile and Artillery Sciences, during November a methodical build-up of forces took place at the positions of the allied troops in the Donbass and Zaporozhye. In early and mid-December, the forces necessary for the implementation of significant tasks from the mobilized fighters should arrive in the liberated territories. Konstantin Sivkov believes that it is then that serious offensive actions can be expected. - We are advancing in the direction of Artemovsk, fierce battles are being fought. In addition, in his opinion, among the priority tasks is the cleansing of Avdiivka and Marinka from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This will finally close the problem of constant artillery and MLRS strikes on key cities of Donbass. And here is what Doctor of Historical Sciences, head of the Center for Military-Political Studies of MGIMO Alexei Podberezkin says. - Ukraine is now, by the end of autumn, really running out of resources. Both in terms of weapons and personnel. According to my estimates, they will have enough strength to close the holes at the front until mid-December at most. The Kiev regime is forced to make a good mine with a bad game. They will continue to portray readiness for the offensive on a daily basis. But after the arrival of additional forces and weapons, the Russian Armed Forces will have every opportunity to encircle enemy groups in the positions occupied, for example, in the DPR and even move forward until the complete liberation of the territory. But not only Russian experts are critical of the situation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For example, retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas McGregor does not understand why Washington takes on faith Kiev's claims of success in the confrontation with Russia. - The Armed Forces of Ukraine are not winning. They lost more than one hundred thousand killed and hundreds of thousands wounded. A huge amount of machinery and equipment was lost, destroyed, stolen. They're on their last legs now. They have nothing to offer. They are waiting for a crushing blow to be dealt to them, which will crush them. This is crazy... When the number was being drawn up. Our troops took the strategically important village of Kurdyumovka - one of those villages from where the Ukronazis constantly shelled Horlivka. Full control over the Gorlovka-Artemovsk highway was established."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690504/,Dmitry DOLMATOV,2022-12-08,"""We are waiting for guys in universities"": students were demobilized in the LPR",Instructions of the President of the country are being carried out,"From the trenches to the desks. Previously mobilized students of the LPR return to universities with certificates of combat veterans. The guys admit that it was their duty to go to serve. But Vladimir Putin's order to demobilize Donbass students, given to him on November 13, is being promptly implemented. All universities in the republic are now working in full-time mode and are ready to re-accept students who have been ""absent"" for service. Fulfilling the presidential order, on November 18, the acting head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, signed a decree on the dismissal from military service of students who had previously been called up as part of mobilization. The guys who visited the frontline were not just honored with kind words - the best of the students received state medals ""For Courage"" and ""For Saving the Dead"", as well as awards of the LPR. - Thank you, - the first deputy head of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation Sergey Kiriyenko, who recently visited Donbass, addressed the students at the award ceremony. - Those of the guys who decided to serve further - good luck to you. Come back healthy. The special operation will definitely end with our victory. You will also have the opportunity to return to universities and continue your studies. And we will make separate courses with individual programs. Everything will happen. And for those who decided to study, I wish to quickly get involved in the curriculum. All the best to you. Students reacted modestly to congratulations and state awards. Except that they proudly pronounced ""I serve Russia!"", Having received medals. Smiles were not hidden, but without the presence of the media, of which there were enough at the presentation, they explained that the service was not easy for them. After all, many were on the front lines. ""I had the honor to attend the award ceremony, where I was awarded the medal ""For Courage,"" said Vladislav Puhalsky, a soldier of the People's Militia of the LPR. - I participated in the capture of Rubezhnoye. My department was one of the first to go there and gain a foothold on the grounds. We held our positions under fire and shelling, did not allow the enemy to enter our native land. The Ukrainians suffered heavy losses and eventually retreated, we fulfilled our task. Some fighters have already changed their military uniforms to a strict jacket. ""I am deeply satisfied that my contribution to the defense of the region was appreciated,"" admitted demobilized soldier Ivan Nazarenko. - But that contribution is exactly the same as a lot of the other guys who fought shoulder to shoulder. The President of Russia emphasized that support measures should be promptly organized for demobilized students of the LPR. Said - done. It is quite simple for guys to return to their native university - you need to write an application to the dean's office of the university about returning to the educational process in your own group. - We are all waiting for students for places in universities. All the lists have already been collected and are being checked,"" said The Minister of Education and Science of the LPR Ivan Kusov. - In particular, we will exempt contractors from paying for training. For all returning students, individual schedules will be drawn up, as well as mentors who will help them make up for the missed material. They will return to exactly the course from which they left for service. In addition, a psychologist will be available at universities for demobilized persons. They will try to involve the children in volunteer activities so that they quickly adapt to the new realities. It is already known that students who want to stay in the People's Militia of the LPR will be granted a sabbatical for the duration of their service. IMPORTANTLY. E-mail hotline of the Ministry of Education and Science of the LPR for appeals on the demobilization of students: demob.monlnr@mail.ru. Hotline: (0642) 34-50-87. SPECIFICALLY. How demobilized students can obtain a certificate of participation in hostilities. - Submit the following documents to the military enlistment office at the place of residence: four color photos measuring 3x4 with a corner on matte paper, copies of the passport and extracts from the orders for enrollment and exclusion from the lists of the unit, a certificate from the military unit on the passage of service indicating the period, the conclusion of the military medical commission, a certificate of medical and social expertise, as well as a certificate on the basis of which the person was demobilized. AND AT THIS TIME. On the instructions of the President, the authorities of the LPR are now paying close attention to the mandatory medical examination of children and adolescents. Doctors daily check the health of children in kindergartens, schools and in the first courses in colleges. According to the Minister of Health of the Republic Natalia Pashchenko, at the end of November, doctors examined more than 15 thousand children. Unfortunately, not all guys have heroic health. Some have to be hospitalized for treatment. ""In almost 70 percent of cases, we find deviations from the norm for health, identify diseases,"" the minister shared. - In half of the cases, these are previously undiagnosed diseases that require the help of medical workers. Based on the results of the examinations, children are awarded a health group. There are five of them. - The mobile teams include a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an ENT doctor, a neurologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a surgeon, an orthopedic traumatologist and an ultrasound specialist. Doctors from Moscow, the Moscow region and Tatarstan came to us, - said the head physician of the Lugansk city children's polyclinic No. 2 Anna Dobrokhotova. We add that information about children with diseases is sent even to the federal center, if the child needs highly qualified help from the best doctors."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690501/,Anna SHILYAEVA,2022-12-08,People are forced to flee from Zelensky's massacres,The Ministry of Health evacuated more than twenty people with limited mobility in Kherson,"The Kiev authorities forced the residents of Kherson to flee from their homes, and then brought the city to a catastrophe. Now there is no light, water and heating. But, most importantly, Russia was able to organize the evacuation of civilians in time and save their lives. ""Armed representatives of the Kiev regime are committing reprisals against civilians suspected of sympathizing with Russia,"" said Vladimir Saldo, acting governor of the region. - People forced to flee from the Nazis to the left bank of the Dnieper river receive comprehensive assistance. Among the evacuees were residents of Kherson with limited mobility. Their transportation from the danger zone was taken over by the Ministry of Health. According to the head of the department Vadim Ilmiev, more than 20 residents of the Kherson region with limited mobility were evacuated to the left bank of the Dnieper - to the Genichesk Central District Hospital. ""We provide the first and all necessary assistance to people with limited mobility and place them in medical institutions of our region,"" Vadim Ilmiev said. An elderly resident of the city of Alešek, who cannot walk, happened to be taken almost out of the shelling. - She is 80 years old, the woman has glaucoma of the last degree, she is not walking. This evacuation took place thanks to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy of the Kherson region represented by Deputy Minister Lebedkin Vladimir Ivanovich and the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The woman was safely taken from Aleshi to the hospital of Kalanchak, - specified in the administration of the Kherson region. At the moment, more than 115 thousand people have been evacuated. Some agreed to leave for other regions of the country, others remained on the left bank, not wanting to go far from their native places. As Vladimir Saldo said, the evacuees receive support from all over Russia. Crimea was the first to receive evacuated residents of the Kherson region. After that, other regions, including the Krasnodar Territory, hosted Kherson residents. A mother of many children, raising three children, shared her impressions of how she lives in Tuapse after the evacuation. - When we arrived, we were accommodated in a great five-bed room. There are very good beds and sofas, a very beautiful view of the sea. Delicious cooking, three meals a day. The climate is good, children really like it here. They came to us from the Tuapse Social Protection Department, we issued all social payments. We are treated very kindly. When I apply for citizenship, I will receive maternity capital and a housing certificate here. We decided to stay here and buy a house in Tuapse,"" she says. A mother of many children added that life is the most valuable thing we have. - We can restore our homes, buy or repair property, life - never! I believe that by agreeing to the evacuation, I made one of the surest decisions in my life,"" she smiled."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690497/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-08,Time for us,Russian troops have shackled the enemy and are creating a reserve for their future offensive,"After the withdrawal of Russian troops from the right bank of the Dnieper near Kherson, the contact line froze, as if frozen. But in fact, it is not the front that is constrained, but the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, forced to cling to the borders and guess what our troops are preparing for them. At the same time, systematic combat work is underway on the Russian side. Its result should be a significant depletion of the enemy's resources. Now is the time for us. While Ukraine is trying to cope with the consequences of our high-precision strikes, the Russian army has time and opportunity to strengthen the SVO zone with new units manned by mobilized guys. And the shelled shock units were released for a decisive offensive. In Ukraine, they started talking about the imminent offensive, the capture of the Crimea, Mariupol ... Well, fine, what kiev calls the emerging shock fist in the Southern direction will be bound, unable to operate either near Kherson or anywhere else. Because the coming of summer and autumn cost the Armed Forces of Ukraine incredibly expensive, Ukraine is unlikely to be able to make up for these losses. Zelensky's stories about the imminent help to Western journalists are an attempt to preserve the illusion of his own solvency at a time when there can no longer be any question of any advantage in manpower. In the area of Kherson and near Zaporozhye, Russian artillerymen, rocketeers, pilots knock out Ukrainian units and equipment from the front line like a hammer. «... operational-tactical and army aviation, missile troops and artillery defeated six enemy control points in the Kherson region... three drones shot down... in the Zaporozhye region, the HIMARS MLRS ammunition depot was destroyed..."" These are excerpts from the summaries of only one day. Even worse for the Armed Forces of Ukraine are our strikes on objects in their rear. Ukraine will inevitably face a shortage of people, equipment and ammunition. If you haven't already. Take, for example, the strike with high-precision missiles on Kryvyi Rih - it paralyzed an entire railway junction. Take a look at the map: from Kryvyi Rih there are transport communications to both Kherson and Enerhodar. Just where Kiev tried to create its proverbial fist for the attack. On the same day, Russian missiles struck Zaporizhia. Information about the affected objects is extremely scarce, Kiev forbade the dissemination of information about the successes of Russian strikes. But it is clear that we are not hitting civilians: fuel bases, warehouses, transport hubs and production enterprises are being destroyed. Ukraine is already faced with a shortage of production and repair facilities, they no longer have a place to repair both their own and the military equipment supplied by the West. But there will be more. The fact that large forces of Kiev were shackled in the south helped our fighters near Donetsk and Lugansk. There are constant positional battles, and the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have the ability to transfer additional forces here tilts the scales in our favor. In the DPR, the troops even went on the offensive: so far we are talking about small settlements - Ozaryanovka, Kurdyumovka and others. However, it is from such small steps that the operational advantage is formed. In addition, according to experts, control over these settlements will help to reach Konstantinovka and create a threat to the encirclement of Bakhmut. In modern times, the threat of encirclement is almost a guarantee that the next settlement will be liberated. By the way, the active actions of Russian troops, the constant threats of their breakthrough in one direction or another in themselves constrain the enemy, deprive him of mobility. If earlier one unit due to rapid movement could cover several critical areas, now, when the pressure goes along the entire front, there is no such possibility. Remember when in the Kharkiv region the Nazis groped our bare areas and broke through them? Russian troops are now doing much the same thing. Not only do the Armed Forces of Ukraine have big problems with people and supplies, but they also disperse forces themselves. For example, they are trying to create a shock fist in the Kharkiv region. On the direction of Svatovo - Kremennaya there are positional battles, the Ukrainians periodically even try to attack. But, as the fighters say, these attacks are becoming weaker and weaker. They involve fewer and fewer militants and equipment, and all attempts to break through can be repulsed. On this line, by the way, artillery batteries of mobilized guys are already fighting. The military officer of Komsomolskaya Pravda, Alexander Kots, having visited one of these units, noted that their commanders are using new tactics of hitting targets. They receive the coordinates of the enemy from reconnaissance and immediately open fire, bypassing the numerous stages of coordination, which used to spend a lot of time. Sometimes it happened that the blow was delivered after hours, when the target was already cold. Now the effectiveness of strikes has increased significantly, scouts are increasingly thanking artillerymen for accuracy and timeliness."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690493/,Vladimir NIKOLAEV,2022-12-08,"In the DPR and LPR, the formation of branches of the Central Bank of Russia began",The financial system of the annexed territories will be transferred to Promsvyazbank,"In the new regions of Russia, there is an active creation of the domestic banking system. In the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics, in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, dozens of branches of Promsvyazbank (PSB) are already operating, and recently a decree of the President of Russia ""On some issues of carrying out the activities of the public joint-stock company ""Promsvyazbank"" in the territories of the DPR and LPR"" was published. The document prescribes how these regions will be integrated into the Russian banking system. First of all, the authorities of both republics should conclude agreements with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the creation of territorial branches of the Bank of Russia on the basis of the Central Republican Bank of the DPR and the State Bank of the LPR. Such branches operate in all constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Then the main banks of the two republics will be transformed into limited liability companies - and 100% of the capital in each of them will belong to the LPR and the DPR, respectively. After that, the financial LLCs will be sold to the Russian PSB for a symbolic price of 1 ruble. Clients and partners of the Central Republican Bank of the DPR and the State Bank of the LPR should not worry about their reorganization - all their obligations are transferred to the PSB as a legal successor. After the completion of organizing procedures in the new regions, a full-fledged banking architecture will begin to operate - the same as in other subjects of Russia: a branch of the Central Bank and banks conducting operations with citizens and legal entities. Yes, there is still only one large bank, but the trouble is the beginning - the rest will pull up along the beaten path. - Promsvyazbank is already actively working in the LPR and the DPR, - said Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Committee on the Financial Market of the State Duma of the Russian Federation. - I think that from next year other banks will begin to come. Perhaps these will be Crimean credit institutions, in particular, RNCB (Russian National Commercial Bank - the largest bank of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, the head office is located in Simferopol, there is a network of branches in the Krasnodar Territory. - Ed.). The situation with banking services in the new Russian regions will be no worse than, for example, in the Crimea or nearby regions of the country. PSB also has branches in Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, but the package of services there is not yet as complete as in other Russian regions. According to the deputy, from next year in New Russia, branches of the Central Bank will also actively work. ""Such subdivisions are already being created in all 4 subjects of the federation in the annexed territories,"" Aksakov continued. - The process is quite active. I think they will be ready for work in the first half of next year. REFERENCE ""KP. Promsvyazbank is a fully state-owned bank, which is the main one for conducting operations on the state defense order. Included in the top 10 banks in the country in terms of assets."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690487/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-10,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 10, 2022: How Kiev is going to survive in 2023 and when the Poles will turn away from refugees from the east","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine for December 10, 2022","Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, said that a letter was sent to the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, which contains facts about the shelling of civilians in Donbass by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is an official document from the Donetsk public organization ""Fair Protection"". The emphasis is on the massive shelling of this week. As a result of the latest shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, five mines in Donetsk were de-energized. Almost 200 miners were underground. All this can be ignored for a long time – but not indefinitely. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, congratulated the deputies of the Kyiv City Council on the adoption of the ""survival budget"" for the next year. The mayor welcomed the deputies who drafted a ""balanced"" financial document. This budget, according to Klitschko, will help to provide critical items of expenditure. Kiev's budget revenues are planned in the amount of more than 66.3 billion hryvnia (about 1.8 billion dollars), expenses - 65.6 billion (1.7 billion dollars). And this is despite the fact that emergency power outages will continue in the capital against the backdrop of blows to the critical infrastructure of Ukraine. What incomes do these managers count on - in the suitcases-safes of the armored train Warsaw-Kiev. The publication Kresy.pl reported that in the south-east of Poland in the city of Przemysl, a refugee from Ukraine attacked an employee with a knife at a branch of PKO Bank Polski. On the frames published on the Web, it is clear that the woman, holding the hair of a bank employee, brandishes a knife. But an elderly woman approached the attacker from behind and began to beat the Ukrainian with a crutch. After that, the guard was able to twist the refugee and she was handed over to the police. Later it became known that the 26-year-old Ukrainian woman had medications that indicated that she was undergoing a course of psychiatric treatment. That is, she may not be punished for an armed attack. In the West, it seems, they hope that the mentally ill Kiev regime will also have nothing for the attack on donbass. Vain dreams. Andriy Marochko, an officer of the LPR people's militia, said that the militants of the Kiev regime lure foreign mercenaries by deception to the Artemovsk area in the DPR. Despite the fact that the VSUshniki themselves refuse to go there under various pretexts. Kiev representatives convinced the foreign soldiers with good luck that they would go to the Dnieper to protect industrial enterprises. And only when the foreigners got out of the cars, they realized that they were located to the west of Artemovsk, in the village of Chasov Yar. These clocks have a short-lived factory, and pretty soon they will stop ticking. Maxim Buyakevich, Russia's deputy permanent representative to the OSCE, believes that the statement of former Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Minsk agreements were signed with one goal - to give Kiev time to prepare for confrontation with Moscow - fully explains the position of the West in the conflict on the territory of The Independent State. Merkel said in an interview with Die Zeit that the Minsk agreements were signed to give Ukraine time and help it become stronger. In her opinion, the countries participating in ""Minsk"" understood that the conflict in the independent was only suspended, but the West was not going to solve the problem. Buyakevich said: ""Western countries use Ukraine as a tool in the fight against Russian statehood. They contribute to the destruction by the hands of their Kiev protégés in Ukraine of everything related to our common history, culture, language and religion."" Well, what else could you expect from them. Reuters reported that Washington is preparing to transfer another package of military assistance to Kiev. It contains technical means to strengthen the air defense system and counter unmanned aerial vehicles for $ 275 million. The United States will also provide independent ammunition for HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems, Humvee armored SUVs and electric generators. Weapons will be transferred from the warehouses of the Pentagon. And when the warehouses are empty, what will the Pentagon do? The Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine reported that the property of the representative office of Gazpromexport was confiscated. This is a real estate object with an area of more than 1,000 square meters and four cars that belong to the representative office of a subsidiary of PJSC Gazprom. Prior to that, the company's assets worth about a million dollars were seized. The fuel seized and seized at the same time was transferred to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Maybe it's time to finish pumping our gas through this twilight zone to Europe. Over the past month, the number of Ukrainian refugees in Britain, who found themselves without a roof over their heads, has grown by almost a third. Almost three thousand people complained about the lack of housing to the self-government bodies. The main reason is that the British do not want to accept Ukrainians in their homes because of the increase in the cost of housing maintenance. The surcharge of 350 pounds sterling under the program ""Houses for Ukraine"" ceased to justify itself. Well, winters in Albion are not frosty..."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690409/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-08,In the focus of the president's attention,The President of Russia does not let go of the focus of his attention the needs of the participants in the operation in Ukraine,"In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting of the Security Council instructed to create a special coordination council under the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, whose task was to meet all the needs of the army during the CVO. The council included representatives of law enforcement agencies, deputy prime ministers of the government, ministers of the socio-economic bloc and representatives of the presidential administration. And although the council works under the leadership of Mishustin, the president regularly receives reports on the results of the work and keeps questions on his activities under his control. Just the other day, at a solemn event on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of Rostec, Putin again drew attention to the supply of the Russian army and demanded ""to increase production and supplies throughout the range of products demanded by the Russian army."" First of all, we are talking about weapons and ammunition. Among the decisions listed by the president is the requirement ""to put into production the best samples of military equipment based on those that are already operating, working, fighting and confirming their characteristics."" And the need for additional incentives for the best workers at dozens of plants in different regions of Russia, working with maximum load and ""in several shifts"". ""People work hard, looking up to our ancestors, to the great traditions of many generations of our master gunsmiths, who proved by their deeds that Russian weapons are a weapon of victory,"" Putin said and assured that ""all decisions to support enterprises will be made as quickly as possible."" It is clear that a good and solid rear is one of the most important components of the success of the operation, but even more important is the state on the front itself, including the support of those who are there from the state. And it's not just about ammunition, shells and drones. It can hardly be argued that everything has been smooth since the first day of the conflict. Partial mobilization was not without problems, the army still lacks new types of weapons, such as the same reconnaissance and attack drones. Something is not being resolved due to bureaucratic confusion. But as for the direct competence of the president, there are no delays and delays. The example of the president is often followed by the heads of the regions of Russia. Everyone knows perfectly well that the governors of the Tula Region, Hero of Russia Alexei Dyumin, Primorsky Krai Oleg Kozhemyako and other not just frequent guests in the units, but also suppliers, curators, and first assistants to military personnel. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin is also trying to clearly implement the president's instructions and solves all issues related to the army, especially those related to the administrative provision of improvements for military personnel and their families, as a matter of priority. Putin at one time insisted that the money due to the mobilized be paid promptly, and emphasized that the basic payments to the military participating in the SVO cannot fall below the established limit. Less is impossible, more , please. On almost any emerging issues, if it is required for a quick solution to the problem, presidential decrees are signed in a short time and amendments to laws are signed by him just as quickly. Yes, what can I say, if only in recent days the president has signed several laws at once that raise the status and level of support not only for the servicemen themselves, but also for their family members. On November 21, news agencies reported that Putin had signed three laws relating to military personnel and their families. According to the first of them, volunteers participating in the operation, and there are more than one thousand of them, are assigned the status of a combat veteran. According to it, volunteers and members of their families, along with ordinary servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, will be able to use the benefits and measures of social support established by law. In addition, volunteers who have become disabled due to injury, concussion or mutilation while participating in a special operation will be able to apply for the status of a disabled combatant. And this is an additional help to them and their relatives. And the law immediately came into force on the day of publication. Another law establishes a supplement to the social pension for recipients of three Orders of Courage or Orders of Personal Courage. And this increase is very significant - 330% of the pension. In 2003, there were officially 35 such people, since then the bill has clearly exceeded a hundred, but, as the president recently noted, in the SVO zone , ""all servicemen are heroes."" This, of course, is not an incentive for a feat (they are performed at all not for the sake of awards, but because of the impossibility of otherwise achieving a solution to the problem), but recognition of merits. Another, no less significant than the first, law on exemption from taxation of material assistance to participants in the CBO and their families. According to it, both gratuitous payments and material assistance provided to these categories are exempt from paying taxes. Payments to seconded employees of companies who travel to the exempted regions to restore infrastructure also fall under tax exemption. And the importance of this amendment to the Tax Code is almost impossible to overestimate for thousands of volunteers who collect for hundreds of millions sleeping bags, leggings, body armor, quadrocopters, products and even optical sights for the participants of the operation, as well as helping the relatives of the participants of the SVO with food, clothing, medicines, etc. Not the first laws and not the last. Because everything related to the SVO remains in the focus of the president's attention."

But there will still be so much to catch up with. The young man's doubts are not surprising. Until recently, he was at the center of hostilities. But after the order of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the demobilization of students, he returned home, where, together with the same guys like him, he took part in a meeting with the first deputy head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Sergey Kiriyenko and the acting head of the DPR Denis Pushilin. ""With the Ministry of Education, we discussed the need to consolidate a teacher-mentor who will work with each of them according to an individual plan,"" said Sergey Kiriyenko. - It is necessary to catch up as quickly as possible, so that we do not waste time, so that the year is not lost. Therefore, the program is adapted accordingly for you. In addition, in Lugansk, all universities work in full-time mode. Unfortunately, this is not yet possible in Donetsk. Online knowledge can not be pulled up, so you can organize a trip to other Russian universities. I set the task that in December or January it would be possible to go to the leading universities of the country at least for a few weeks. The meeting of demobilized students with Sergey Kiriyenko and Denis Pushilin was held informally. At the end of it, those who returned from the front line were solemnly presented with military awards. Since it will not be easy to catch up with classmates, it was decided that individual curricula will be drawn up for the demobilized. ""When the children were mobilized, we decided, like all other universities, to send them on academic leave,"" says Svetlana Drozhzhina, rector of Donetsk National University of Economics and Trade. - Upon return, it is enough to write a statement that the young man returns to the educational process in his own group. But during this time, academic debts have formed, so an individual training plan will be worked out, a curator will be assigned to each of them. And if during the participation of a student in hostilities, his group graduated, say, from a bachelor's degree, under the guidance of his mentor and he will be able to defend himself, pass exams and enter the magistracy. Among the students there are many who decided to stay on the front line. For 9 months that the guys took part in hostilities, they managed to get a military profession. Five recent soldiers came to the meeting with Sergei Kiriyenko and Denis Pushilin in military uniform. - Why in uniform? Have you decided to continue to serve? - asked the acting head of the DPR. -Yes. - My principled position is that first all university students are demobilized. And only then those who want to, sign a contract. The freshman, who was among the five who decided to remain in the ranks, was offered to graduate from a military school and become an officer. With each of the others - a separate conversation. Many of the young people, such as 19-year-old Nikita Mashkov, want to use the acquired skills for the benefit of Donbass. And then become military. ""I was mobilized on March 11, 2022, I'm a sapper,"" he said. - Before the army, he studied at the Technical University. Mine clearance was taught to me in the unit, and then I gained practical experience. We were sent to Mariupol, I took an active part in the cleansing of the city, the demining of Azovstal. And I decided to stay in the army, realizing that there are very few people with such skills, and the need to clear the territory of dangerous objects in our republic is very large. I even love doing it! I think that at the end of the contract I will return to my studies, and then I will connect my life with the military sphere. My family supported me in my decision. IMPORTANT. Since November 20, the DPR has launched a round-the-clock hotline on the demobilization of students. Each of them will receive the status and certificate of a participant in hostilities (and all the benefits due under Russian law). All children are guaranteed the provision of psychological assistance. And those who studied for a fee will be transferred to the budget. The hotline number for the demobilization of students and mobilization in the DPR is 45-0-45"

For ordinary residents - an opportunity to see how the developed system of Russian health care differs from the Ukrainian one, to get free high-quality care and medications. The introduction of the standards of Russian medicine is gradual. Doctors need to get a lot of new information. Training seminars and communication with colleagues from other regions come to the rescue. In November, an educational seminar was held in Simferopol - organizers from the healthcare sector and financiers were invited to it, and the experts at the event were the Minister of Health Mikhail Murashko, representatives of the FFOMS, Roszdravnadzor, the Federal Ministry of Health, experts, employees of the Ministry of Health, Roszdravnadzor and medical organizations of the Republic of Crimea. The Minister of Health of the Russian Federation outlined the priority tasks that the industry is now facing. - The health care system should be patient-oriented and built on the principles of accessibility of all types of medical care. Every patient expects fast and effective medical care, sympathy and compassion from us,"" he said. The main issue for discussion at the seminar was the transition period that is in effect now. Before a full-fledged transition to Russian legislation, it is important to start work on the new rules now. Many questions were raised by the provision of hospitals with medicines and consumables, the basics of financial management of healthcare organizations. Now doctors sent by the Ministry of Health from all regions of the Russian Federation conduct receptions for patients in specialized areas, as well as provide high-tech care, conduct complex operations. And patients get used to the fact that you can get help in case of illness for free, while receiving the necessary medications. For example, at the end of November, the best oncologists arrived in the region. - The main task of the visit is to analyze the system of medical care for oncological patients of the Zaporozhye region. All our efforts are aimed at ensuring that each patient feels the improvement in the quality and accessibility of medical care, which does not differ from other subjects of the Russian Federation. The National Medical Research Center of Oncology named after N. N. Blokhin will coordinate issues on the treatment of all needy cancer patients in the leading institutions of the country, - said Tigran Gevorgyan, Deputy Director of the NMIC for the implementation of federal projects. Preventive medical examinations for children have begun in the hospitals of the region - they are organized by the Ministry of Health together with the regional government. This is necessary in order to make a control section on children's health and understand what kind of help they need. Next year, the costs of drug provision for hospitals in the Zaporizhzhya region and their equipment with modern equipment, as well as for the repair of buildings will be included in the budget of the Russian Federation. OFFICIAL. On December 1, a federal bill on the integration of health systems of new regions was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for discussion. For consideration, changes related to compulsory health insurance, personnel decisions and medical education are proposed.

In June, school No. 15 in Melitopol was the first in the region to receive documents on state accreditation of Rosobrnadzor. Other educational institutions subsequently joined it. Now they will be able to issue Russian-style certificates to schoolchildren. Since September 1, schoolchildren have been studying according to Russian textbooks. Five million books and manuals were brought to the returned Russian territories. All teaching in schools is in Russian language, but Ukrainian is also forgotten. It will be studied as a native. - If you look at the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, you can see that in eight years most schools have been completely renovated, new kindergartens and schools have been built. It is very important that the relevant changes take place in the Zaporozhye region, in Melitopol. We are doing everything for this. And those programs that are implemented in our country and provide high quality education training in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology will also be implemented in schools of the Zaporozhye region, - said the Minister of Education of Russia Sergey Kravtsov at a meeting with teachers of the region. Starting next year, uniform educational standards will come to the classrooms, according to which students will receive knowledge. They will be more specific, a foreign language can be studied at will, textbooks for all schools will be the same, special attention will be paid to patriotic education. Unified federal general education programs in a number of basic disciplines will appear before January 1, 2023. They will be developed taking into account regional, national and ethno-cultural specifics. By the way, high school students in history lessons - this is one of the innovations - will study the causes and course of a special military operation in Ukraine. At a recent working meeting, the shortage of teachers in Zaporizhzhya schools was discussed by the Minister of Science and Higher Education Valeriy Falkov and the acting head of the region Yevhen Balitsky. - The problem remains relevant for us and requires a systemic solution. To date, the shortage of personnel is about a thousand teachers, of which about two hundred are primary school teachers,"" Balitsky said. The shortage of teachers is compensated by Russian teachers who go to work in schools of the Zaporozhye region. The local university joined the work to fill the shortage of teachers. Teachers of the university train teachers and conduct advanced training courses. And the Russian Historical Society takes scientists under its wing. Children from the Zaporozhye region during the school year rest in the sanatoriums of the Crimea. The conditions of stay of schoolchildren were checked by representatives of the regional Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Among the vacationers were many young athletes, musicians and dancers. Now gifted children cannot attend clubs and sections at home, they do not have musical instruments, and it is not easy to restore skills after a long break. Therefore, the regional delegation collected information about each child who needs additional classes in his profile while he is on a long rest. ""As soon as possible, we will start working on the problems of every child from our region,"" said Yuriy Kovanov, Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Zaporizhzhya region, after the visit. - Information that does not relate specifically to our activities will be transferred to the supervising ministries. The main goal now is to properly integrate the achievements of the guys into the legal field of Russia. Based on the experience of working in this sanatorium, we plan to help other children who will face difficulties. During the visit, the Minister of Culture of the Youth Government of Crimea Oksana Trigub held a master class on vocals for everyone. ""I want this thread not to be broken, so that the guys could realize their dreams of a profession,"" Trigub said. It was decided that children involved in sports and music will be supervised by local teachers, and several girls will be helped to prepare for admission to universities in a sports profile."

Doctors surround new mothers with warmth and care, and volunteers try to do everything to make women in labor feel comfortable. Since July, the city of Sevastopol has taken patronage over Melitopol. The public organization ""Sevastopol Mothers"" decided to actively support young wards from the new region of Russia. Activists sent ""boxes of kindness"" to new mothers - they contain stocks of diapers for about two to three months, children's cosmetics, wet wipes, clothes of several sizes and toys for babies. - This is the second time we are visiting our sponsored babies in the Melitopol maternity hospital. Last time we raised funds for food for premature babies. In this - we brought kits for newborns, specialized baby food, diapers, disinfectants and hygiene products, diapers and baby clothes, - said the chairman of the organization ""Sevastopol Mothers"" Elena Golubeva (in the photo on the left). The project in the sponsored territory, according to the volunteer, is being implemented with the support of the Presidential Grants Foundation. Some of the necessary things for mothers are purchased with budget money, and the rest of the needs are bought at the expense of not indifferent Sevastopol residents. On the next trip, ""Sevastopol Mothers"" plan to bring not only children's kits to the Melitopol maternity hospital as assistance. Among the things will also be warm blankets, medical equipment, surgical gowns. In particular, volunteers need electric suction pumps, umbilical catheters and chintz diapers. Recall that the Melitopol maternity hospital began to receive support from Russia even before the Zaporozhye region became a new region of the Russian Federation. Professional Russian doctors began to work in the medical institution, the necessary medicines and kits for women in labor were sent to the maternity hospital as humanitarian aid, and doctors received salaries in rubles.

But screening in Melitopol has not been carried out since July.

She donated assistance to a maternity hospital, a children's and youth sports school and a center for children left without parental care. - As part of the humanitarian cargo, we brought consumables, which are so necessary here: baby food, hygiene products and so on. There was an application, and first of all, these needs were voiced to us. This is my first, but not my last visit here,"" Lobach said. Novgorod entrepreneurs brought a batch of humanitarian aid to Enerhodar. It included food, 20 generators and 200 warm blankets for needy residents. In the Vasilyevsky district, mobile teams of volunteers began to work. They provide targeted assistance to residents with disabilities: they take them to a doctor's appointment or for paperwork, to a bank or to the post office. ""People's unity is humanitarian aid that comes to Enerhodar from all corners of our country: boiler houses - from the Crimea, medicines - from Chechnya, building materials - from Veliky Novgorod,"" the administration said. Vasilyevsky District took custody of Veliky Novgorod. The other day, another batch of humanitarian aid was delivered from there.

The authorities of Sevastopol provided the Melitopol district with 200 tons of coal for the Priazovsky, Alexandrovsky and Novovasilevsky rural settlements. The fuel will be used to heat kindergartens and schools. Coal was received as part of the patronage assistance from the regions of Russia. Four Belarus tractors arrived in Tokmak from Penza. According to the representative of the Penza delegation, the equipment helps to clean the streets in Rozovka, Kuibyshev, Molochansk and Tokmak. The Kubans sent 40 tons of aid to the soldiers defending Melitopol. Collection points were organized in the Caucasian, Kazan and Losevsky Cossack farms, as well as on the basis of the Kropotkin city hospital. Humanitarian aid will be received by the soldiers of the 22nd separate special forces brigade. The humanitarian cargo was delivered to Melitopol by the Cossacks themselves - many of them not for the first time in the SVO zone. Children of a number of villages of the Kuibyshev district of the Zaporozhye region received humanitarian aid collected by the children of the village of Geli, Karabudakhkent district of the Republic of Dagestan. Previously, they had not heard of such a settlement, and now they thank their peers. The humanitarian aid, which was delivered to the Kuibyshev district by servicemen of the Marine Corps of the Caspian Flotilla, included food, school uniforms, as well as letters for the country's defenders. Railway workers of the Trans-Baikal Railway collected more than a ton of humanitarian aid as part of the charity event ""Let's Support Ours!"". Things will be sent to the LDNR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. The organizers of the action noted that they tried to follow the recommended list of goods. In addition to clothes, bed linen, the shipment included baby food, dishes, stationery, hygiene products, household appliances, according to the information of the ZabZHD. The humanitarian cargo was loaded at the belogorsk stations in the Amur Region and Karymskaya in Transbaikalia, the train has already departed along the route."

This holiday was revived recently, and its roots go back to the reign of Empress Catherine II, to the establishment of the Order of St. George the Victorious. Since that time, the series of our heroes-compatriots is endless and multifaceted. But they carried through the centuries and generations their selfless love for the Motherland and loyalty to military duty. Today we will name the names of the heroes of the Fatherland, who a month and a half ago lived an ordinary life. They devoted themselves entirely to work, business, families, hobbies. After the summons, they did not run from the military commissariat. Like many other privates, sergeants, corporals and reserve officers arrived at the assembly point, underwent retraining, coordination at the training grounds, received uniforms, personal weapons, went to the zone of a special military operation and had already managed to receive their first state awards in the SVO. Today, they selflessly defend our Motherland on the front lines. They are sure that the enemy does not have the slightest chance of success. And all because Russia is fighting for a just cause. Guards Senior Lieutenant Victor Chelnoko. ""After receiving information from intelligence units about the movement of the enemy's sabotage and reconnaissance group in the direction of the defense area of Russian units, the motorized rifle company under the command of Guards Senior Lieutenant Viktor Chelnokov quickly moved to the specified line and took up the defense. Having destroyed the saboteurs, Chelnokov ordered the grenade throwers and machine gunners to change position. After the destruction of the sabotage and reconnaissance group, the nationalists went on the offensive with the support of armored vehicles. Thanks to the competent decision of the Guard of Senior Lieutenant Chelnokov, the grenade throwers, using the effect of surprise, destroyed a tank and 2 enemy infantry fighting vehicles with accurate fire. Having lost the support of armored vehicles and having suffered losses from the concentrated fire of a motorized rifle company, the enemy retreated. The prompt, calibrated and competent actions of the motorized rifle company under the command of the Guards Senior Lieutenant Viktor Chelnokov made it possible to hold an important defensive line, prevent the enemy from breaking through, go on the main forces in a counteroffensive and capture a tactically important area. "" Senior Lieutenant of the Medical Service Hamzat IBRAHIMO. ""Senior Lieutenant of the Medical Service Khamzat Ibragimov, being under enemy artillery fire, provided emergency medical care to the wounded on the spot. Some of the soldiers, who received minor injuries, continued to fight, and Ibragimov evacuated the more serious wounded to a safe place. Khamzat Ibragimov personally carried three wounded Russian servicemen from enemy fire to safety, who could not move themselves, which saved their lives. The steadfastness and professionalism of the senior lieutenant of the medical service Khamzat Ibragimov made it possible to minimize the losses of motorized rifle personnel and save the lives of servicemen."" Lieutenant Colonel Sergei ISEVSKI. ""The motorized rifle battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Sergei Ishevsky, was tasked with organizing the defense of one of the strategically important areas of the terrain. Armed formations of Ukrainian nationalists attempted an offensive and subjected the defensive positions of the battalion of Sergei Ishevsky to massive artillery fire. After receiving information from scouts about the movement of the enemy's sabotage and reconnaissance group in the direction of Russian troops, the motorized rifle units of Lieutenant Colonel Ishevsky quickly organized the defense. During the fierce fighting, Sergei's unit destroyed up to 70 militants, 2 BMPs and 1 tank. Despite the many times superior forces, having suffered significant losses, the enemy was forced to retreat. The bold and selfless actions of Lieutenant Colonel Sergei Ishevsky and the professionalism of his subordinates made it possible to hold the occupied line and create conditions for the development of a successful offensive of the main forces.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4689696/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-08,Three factors that will change the course of the special operation: Russia has prepared a springboard for the offensive,Military expert Alexander Mikhailov named three factors that will change the course of the special operation in Ukraine,"The Russian grouping of troops in the zone of the special military operation has prepared a springboard for the offensive and defense, said military expert, head of the Bureau of Military-Political Analysis Alexander Mikhailov. Our soldiers are much better prepared for combat operations in sub-zero temperatures than the enemy. There are a number of reasons that can become a turning point and change the course of the special operation this winter. The first of them is Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. In addition, there are great risks of reduced support for the West and the flight of foreign mercenaries who take part in the battles extensively. ""Attacks on infrastructure de-energize railway communication routes,"" Mikhailov said on the morning program ""What will happen"" on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda. - The very logistics of the delivery of ammunition, new weapons, personnel, the removal of wounded fighters from the battle line, the shipment of broken, damaged equipment or in need of repair. Now Western equipment is mainly repaired in Poland and Eastern Europe in general. That logistics is broken. And therefore, for the winter period, when additional food, hydrocarbon fuel, power generators and so on are so necessary, everything that allows the group to function normally in the winter, the delivery of all this to the contact line is associated with great logistical problems. - And how serious is the counteroffensive of the Russian Armed Forces, in what direction is the advance of our troops likely? The host asked. - The contact line is now very long, almost 1200 kilometers. Starting from the Kherson region and up to the borders of the Kharkiv region, clashes do not stop, the entire contact line is active. True, weather conditions lead to some stiffness, both sides switch to the winter period, there is a re-uniform of fighters, and the arrival of military equipment, which is prepared for the winter period, equipped with appropriate liquids and fuel and lubricants. This is the supply of related equipment to the troops, which allows you to create more comfortable living conditions. In this respect, Russian troops are much better prepared. We have formed a long and deeply layered line of defense. It runs along the left bank of the Dnieper and further along the contact line up to the Kharkiv region. On our part, additional forces of personnel are concentrated, the mobilized Russians are taking control of the settlements of the new regions of Russia, ensuring law and order there. Plus the material and technical base accumulated for the upcoming winter period. In this regard, on the Ukrainian side, everything is much sadder. And we see that all the attempts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past few weeks to make at least a little progress have failed. After the regrouping of Russian troops from Kherson to the left bank, no more settlements came under the control of Ukraine. On the contrary, a number of settlements came under the control of Russia. First of all, these are settlements in the DPR. The advance towards Artemovsk and the liberation of small settlements in the agglomerations and the further prospect of access to Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - this leads to the achievement of the main result, the complete liberation of the territories of Donbass. Let's hope that these goals will be achieved in the coming weeks. - Right in the coming weeks, you think. - I mean the liberation of the DPR. Weeks are a stretchy concept. But it seems to me that in the winter, that is, in December, January and February, there will be a turning point in the course of hostilities. Because the Russian army is better prepared for the winter, both materially and technically. Russian equipment fights at low temperatures, unlike Western, which is not always tested in these conditions and latitudes. And the mercenary units on which this collective support of the Ukrainian army is based... I strongly doubt that they are ready to conduct combat operations in real sub-zero temperatures and in the absence of proper logistics support. It seems to me that after the New Year they will flee from Ukraine en masse. I think that winter will put everything in its place, General Moroz is traditionally on the Russian side. The situation on the front could lead to political proposals from the Kiev regime, which has problems with both energy and Western partners, which are less and less willing to supply the regime with weapons. It seems to me that the formats and scale of assistance to Ukraine will soon be revised in the direction of a significant reduction. And this will be said either before the New Year, or immediately after, through the mouths of European politicians. Among the Ukrainian elite, this will certainly cause disappointment. But it must be said that even the American elites, who are directly in charge of the conflict, are clearly tired of the Ukrainian agenda. LISTEN AS WELL.

But we see that today some of our most combat-ready units are concentrated in the Bakhmut area, they are successfully fighting. The tactics of conducting combat operations by squeezing out the enemy, using a fire shaft, justify themselves. But the task is not to take a village or a city at lightning speed at any cost. - You yourself were in the special operation zone. -Yes. I talked to servicemen, saw with my own eyes how everything happens. The main thing is to save people's lives. - And what are your impressions? Not everything goes according to the pre-planned plan. - The idea, which was at the first stage, then at the second, when we withdrew from Kiev, Kharkiv, Kherson - changed. Now many of the mobilized have been put into service, they have made up for the losses, consolidated the front. - And if you compare what we see today and for example a month or two ago. Our actions have changed a lot. - There is definitely a big effect from our use of high-precision weapons. It is certain that today we have a higher morale, unlike the mercenaries on the other side. - And the level of professional training. - I personally underwent training in one of the training centers together with the mobilized, I experienced today's tactics of warfare. The guys from the Novosibirsk school - my dear - gave me many lessons. And the mobilized guys there also learned a lot for themselves. - But the enemy is also learning. -Yes. We have information that 15,000 trained Ukrainians came from the UK. They received relevant skills and knowledge there. The Americans are also preparing - they have gone through many wars. But, to summarize, our forms of warfare are superior to those of the enemy. And, again, our morale is also much higher. - You have seen the work of those mobilized at the Donbass training grounds. - At the training ground near Luhansk. It's not just guys who first saw a mortar or a quadcopter who are engaged there, they already have the skills. They are really prepared for combat. - Vladimir Putin said that 77,000 were mobilized already in combat units in the special operation zone. - And here it is important to understand how they operate. You will not run over an entire unit of mobilized fighters on the front. As a rule, they are introduced in groups into existing and warring units. Either as additional forces, or to make up for losses. - The most painful question now: they have everything they need. - Of course there are questions. But there are much fewer of them than in the first stage. The offensive actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have stalled. The possibilities of the Ukrainian army are not unlimited. Their losses are ten times greater. - Who is more among our mobilized - paratroopers, tankers, artillerymen, motorized infantry. - Motorized riflemen and assault groups are most in demand. We really need tankers, artillerymen, mortarmen, specialists in electronic warfare. - There are special requirements for gunners. - At the first stage, we were not sufficiently prepared for artillery duels, counter-battery fighting. Now they perform tasks very well. - They say neither side takes any artillerymen prisoners. - I have never heard when ""dills"" were taken prisoner, for someone to blow himself up with a grenade And we have many cases when guys sacrifice themselves to save others, to accomplish a task. Only among the graduates of the Novosibirsk school there are 8 Heroes of Russia, 5 of them died, someone blew himself up with a grenade. - When all 300 thousand mobilized will be in the zone of special operation, the end will come for Kiev. - Completing tasks should not involve freezing this conflict. Ukraine will not have to be used as a battering ram against us either tomorrow or in the distant future. When the tasks are completed, we'll see. - To what extent partner countries help us with the supply of weapons, ammunition, components, technologies. - Now our own enterprises of the military-industrial complex are working at full capacity. We have the Union State of Russia and Belarus - so we are working there in this direction. Let's put it this way: military-technical cooperation with a number of other states also continues. - With Iran? After all, the Gerani are copies of Iranian drones. - They say so. But today they are actively produced in Russia. Listen, when the West resents that Iran is ready to provide drones to Russia... And who cares? Today, Western countries fully provide Ukraine with weapons. If they had not provided, the hostilities would have ended long ago. - Western supplies are the only thing that saves Ukraine. -Yes. And manpower, and military equipment. They live and act according to laws that are understandable to them, I mean western countries. They supply Kiev with anti-personnel mines-petals, which are banned, there is a request for the supply of cluster bombs. - And we don't need Chinese military assistance. - We have enough forces and means inside our own country to ensure the fulfillment of the tasks of a special military operation. - And chips, electronic systems that China produces, and about the shortage of which the Western media write in our country. - The Western media can write anything. - Okay, and we need people - volunteers from friendly countries. - The current grouping that performs tasks there is sufficient. The President said this when he met with the Human Rights Council. - Since October 10, we have been hitting the energy structure of Ukraine - and we are told: you are hitting people. - Let's remember that these are retaliatory actions to sabotage by Ukraine and their curators on the Crimean bridge. Yes, today the goal is to deliver critical blows to the enemy's energy infrastructure. But it is possible to make sure that the civilian population does not suffer. At the same time, you can not stop - I would also include the transport infrastructure here. -Railways. - Railway junctions and bridges across the Dnieper. Do everything possible to stop the supply of weapons and personnel to the combat zone. But what limits us is, again, the civilian population. It feels it. People understand who Zelensky is, where his wife is. It's in Brussels, London. And ordinary Ukrainians are told, ""You will be patient."" Well, so be with them and endure then. - It's too early for us to enter into negotiations. - We have repeatedly stated that we are ready for negotiations. Unlike Ukraine. Zelensky today says A, tomorrow B, the day after tomorrow again A. How to negotiate with him? It is clear that he is the president of the country, but at the same time we understand that he is dancing to the tune of America. The tasks set in the special operation should be implemented within the framework of negotiations. We must not deviate from those tasks. If they say, conditionally: ""Let's go back to the events of February 24, roll back,"" this is unacceptable. - That is, you do not assume that negotiations may begin in the near future. - As of today, I don't assume that. LISTEN AS WELL. Is Poland ready to hold referendums in Western Ukraine?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690452/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-09,Why were we so naïve? Why Russia Believed the West by Signing the Minsk Agreements,"The hosts of the morning broadcast of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" discussed with the head of the Department of Political Science and Sociology of the Plekhanov University Andrei Koshkin a sensational statement by Angela Merkel","The statement of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Minsk agreements were signed only in order to give Ukraine time to prepare for a military confrontation with Russia became, on the one hand, a sensation, and on the other hand, only confirmed what everyone knew and so. Merkel's words once again showed that Ukraine needed diplomatic moves only to prepare for war. With a request to comment on the revelations of Frau Merkel, the hosts of the morning show ""What will happen"" on the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" turned to the expert of the Association of Military Political Scientists, head of the Department of Political Science and Sociology of the Plekhanov University Andrei Koshkin. - How did you look at Minsk-1 and Minsk-2 then? Ivan Pankin asked. - After all, all this history has shown that military operations should end with the unconditional victory of one of the parties and the signing of surrender. And if there are any peace agreements, it means that they will continue sooner or later... - Yes, in 2014 it was necessary to complete our success - Illovaisk and Debaltseve gave us such an opportunity. But history does not tolerate the subjunctive mood, and now there is no point in saying what should have been done. Merkel's speech seems to me to be very successful. It is associated with the words of Poroshenko. He, too, came out politically when he said he signed the Minsk agreements to buy time and build a new army in Ukraine. And precisely in order to fight With Russia. When Merkel said the same thing now, I really liked the statement of the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, that this could become a subject for an international tribunal. They want to create a tribunal against Russia, but let's first deal with France and Germany, which acted as guarantors of the Minsk agreements! It turns out that they knew in advance that they were misleading the entire world community by signing these agreements. They demanded their implementation, but in fact they were preparing anti-Russia from Ukraine. They stuffed it with weapons, military equipment, tore up everything related to Russia in ideological and humanitarian terms. And the blatant impoverishment of Ukrainian society made it possible to quickly recruit and mobilize the armed forces of Ukraine and direct them against Russia. Will such theses promote the information resources of the collective West? Unlikely. But it seems to me that the special international tribunal that they came up with for the information and propaganda attack on Russia will most likely be put on the brakes. - And why were we so naïve? - asked the second host of ""What will happen"" Igor Vittel. - Have we not seen the restructuring of the Ukrainian army and the build-up of power? Did we believe our Western partners? Or for some reason we also benefited from this pause. - All these questions, of course, now arise for everyone. I think the first thing is that we had to bring our reliable allies, the army and navy, to a level that allows us to feel confident in the next steps on the foreign policy trajectory. But there is one more point: Vladimir Vladimirovich is an excellent negotiator, and he did everything to maintain stability in Europe. I wouldn't say we ""trusted."" We were just looking for an opportunity to keep peace in Europe. Now no one believes in it, because everyone's head turned on the back. And we actually abided by the Minsk agreements to keep the peace. For them, Ukraine and Europe, it was profitable for a certain time. But how did they keep the peace? They destroyed the Russian people in the Donbass! And Chancellor Olaf Scholz smiled and said – what a genocide there is. And this is the great-grandson of the lieutenant general who was engaged in the genocide of the Russian people on the Leningrad front. And we tried to keep the peace to the last. Look, when the Russian Security Council was openly held, our president did not immediately announce the decision. He called Macron and Scholz and said: we have not yet made a decision on the recognition of the Donbass republics, let's do something to prevent bloodshed. No, they flatly refused. And because they can't do things any other way, they're in a ditch that Washington has set, they're only following orders from Washington. And you know that even the Japanese believed that the fighting began not on February 24, but on February 15, when the intensity of shelling of residential areas of Donetsk increased. We are talking about the fact that from February 15 to February 23, the intensity increased 60 times. More precisely, from 30 to 60 times, the Japanese calculated. It was an artillery preparation in order to go to the Donbass after it and cut out the entire Russian-speaking population. We just pre-empted, saved our people, they are now residents of our territory. And, of course, in this situation, we did absolutely the right thing. LISTEN AS WELL.

One of their main tasks is to help those who want to go to other regions of Russia, finding themselves on the left bank of the Dnieper. Recently, activists helped a teacher who could not leave an elderly mother with limited mobility alone. Having received a request, the volunteers immediately went to help. - We are approached with similar requests every day. Basically, these are people who need to transport low-mobility, elderly relatives. We involve the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia, ambulance services and try to help everyone, and we will also continue to do this, - said igor Kastyukevich, head of the humanitarian mission of the United Russia party in the Kherson region. Natalia, a teacher from the Skadovsky district, appealed to the activists of the mission when she lost hope of leaving. "" We had a lot of things and pets. It just seemed impossible. We already thought that we would have to stay, although it was very scary. But we turned to volunteers, and they quickly organized everything. A whole team came to the rescue - everyone was transferred to the bus and comfortably taken to Dzhankoy - thank the women volunteers for their help. This is not the only case. For example, a week earlier, an elderly woman who needed medical attention was also evacuated from Skadovsk. She had problems with her eyesight and with blood vessels, exacerbated by her experiences. Now the woman is helped by doctors and her granddaughter Olga, who left with her. Volunteers also help with medicines. Recently, humanitarian mission activists delivered medical kits to the village of Zalizny Port. Residents of Kherson evacuated here complained about the lack of medicines. And volunteers rushed to the rescue. The kits themselves were formed at the request of evacuated residents: they included vitamins, painkillers, antipyretics, sedatives, heart drugs. And the rural medical center was also transferred both the simplest drugs and means of narrowly focused action. Volunteers also work with children who are in temporary accommodation centers on the left bank of the Dnieper. In the Genichesk district, sports training was organized for the children."

The children will demonstrate the acquired skills to the mentors the next time they arrive. It is worth noting that the guys already have a good sports training - someone owns the techniques of boxing, the girls were engaged in dancing, gymnastics and choreography. The most active young athletes were entitled to sweet, and not only, prizes from United Russia volunteers.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690571/,Dmitry DOLMATOV,2022-12-08,Happiness to see the world,Ophthalmologists from Yakutia returned sight to 163 residents of Donbass. The head doctor of the Yakut hospital Ivan Lutskan told details about his humanitarian mission,"163 servicemen and civilians of Donbass regained their sight thanks to the head physician of the Yakutsk Republican Ophthalmological Clinical Hospital, the winner of the contest ""Leaders of Russia"" Ivan Lutskan and his team. Lutskan and his colleagues were on a business trip to Kirovsky. Doctors learned that patients there were treated using outdated technologies, in addition, there was an acute shortage of narrowly focused specialists. Every day, doctors worked 12-14 hours a day, receiving patients and training colleagues from Donbass. KP spoke to the hero in a white coat. - Ivan Petrovich, how did you decide to go from Yakutia to the DPR. - When I went through the crucible of the contest ""Leaders of Russia"" and won there, I understood what tasks the state faces. What contribution is required from me to the development of the country. The choice of whether to go or not, in front of me did not even stand. And I was pleased to see my colleagues around me who volunteered to go to the DPR with me. This is the most important thing - to see such a conscious, responsible decision from the team. - You stayed in Kirov for almost three weeks. They were probably like one long marathon. - We tried to work from early morning until 9 - 10 pm. People lined up at one o'clock in the morning for coupons. We received everyone, even on a first-come, first-served basis. We have established a good reception of patients. People from other cities immediately pulled up to us. Word of mouth instantly worked. They came from Donetsk, Novoazovsk, Yenakiieve, Snizhne. In total, we received more than 1.5 thousand patients. - What specialists were lacking in the local hospital. - A neurologist, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, ultrasound specialist, X-ray laboratory assistant were required. We took all of them with us on the trip. And they also described mammograph images remotely - 339 studies were conducted for women. There were more than 540 ultrasound examinations. The neurologist before us was only one in the whole city, rushing from hospital to clinic. And, of course, there was an urgent need for ophthalmologists, especially ophthalmic surgeons. So the patients went through a full cycle: from the initial diagnosis of vision problems to the operation and discharge. Prior to our arrival, operations there were paid. 50 - 60 thousand rubles per eye. Pensioners could not pull such an amount. - What problems did people address you with? - A lot of patients with cataracts. People had a cloudy lens, they could not see well. On average, these are patients aged 50 to 90 years. A lot of neglected cases. For people to regain their sight was a great miracle. I have never heard such words of gratitude anywhere. They came with apples, pears from their garden. We cried with joy. We performed 163 operations. And behind each is a touching story. There were also young guys who suffered an eye injury at the front, including those with shrapnel. Many workers from the mines who had pieces of coal in their eyes. - What cases do you remember. - They brought my 83-year-old grandmother. For the past five years, she has seen nothing and walked by touch. And after the operation, she walked herself for the first time in a long time. She came to us and cried: ""Lord, I am so grateful to you! I see you, now at least I can walk around the apartment, go down to the store and walk a little."" I also remember a 28-year-old girl from Donetsk with a small child. She has been visually impaired since childhood. Congenital cataract, the crystal is removed. Only one eye sees - with a lens of minus 18. It's a tough case, but we weighed the pros and cons and performed the surgery. And now she can see the world without glasses and lenses, calmly raise a child. KSTAT. Ivan Lutskan promises that Yakut doctors will return to the DPR. Now plans are being formed for the trips of doctors in 2023. - There are already requests for our work on surgery and various consultations in Mariupol. We believe it is our duty to come there. And, of course, we will not forget our sponsored city of Kirovskoye. And Yakutia itself will help the city in all spheres. We will not leave anyone in trouble."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690569/,Dmitry SERGEEV,2022-12-08,The industrial potential of Donbass is on the rails,Enterprises resume work and increase production rates,"After interruptions in the work of recent years, mainly associated with brutal incessant shelling by the armed formations of Ukraine, an electric furnace for the production of ferrosilicon was put into operation at the Stakhanov ferroalloy plant of the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex. With the help of the unit, the company's employees have already produced the first tons of FS45 products. This is a metal alloy, the basis of which is iron, its content should be at least 49.2%. The administration of the Stakhanov plant noted that the repair and commissioning of the furnace were carried out by the employees of the Donbas enterprise. ""Despite the shelling, the enterprise did not stop working, and the plant staff regularly carried out the necessary work to ensure the full functioning of all technological equipment,"" the plant's management said. Also at the ferroalloy plant, furnace number seven was returned to operation. Thus, the company resumed the production of ferrosilicomanganese - a fragile alloy of iron, silicon and manganese, which is used in metallurgy as a deoxidizer of steel and for its alloying. It gives iron-based alloys strength, wear resistance and impact resistance. The plant said that the furnace did not work for two years. The reason for this was the Ukrainian shelling, the results of which the equipment was disabled, there were regular interruptions in power supply. All this hampered the normal functioning of the plant. - Now these difficulties are in the past, - noted at the enterprise. - After carrying out repair, preparatory and commissioning works, the furnace has passed the necessary technological period of heating and is currently reaching the operating parameters. Furnace number four at the plant decided to transfer to the production of high-silicon ferrosilicon of the FS65 brand. This is a metal alloy, the basis of which is silicon, its content can range from 63% to 68%. "" Now our production volume is 62 tons of ferrosilicon per day and 72 tons of ferrosilicomanganese,"" said Vitaly Podorvanov, head of the smelting shop. - We stood for a very long time because of the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There were hits in production buildings, damage to lines, and we could not start normal work. Podorvanov stressed that the resumption of the functioning of the enterprise became possible thanks to the labor collective, the YMMK company and the plant's management. ""We gathered the team, prepared the furnaces for inclusion, and when it calmed down a little, we resumed production,"" the head of the smelting shop shares. - We look to the future positively, a very reliable company has come. Young cadres are being pulled up, we are training them. I think there will be a worthy change. It should be noted that the products of the Stakhanov Ferroalloy Plant are in demand at all enterprises of the contour of the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex. - At all enterprises of the complex, production capacities are steadily increasing. Repair and restoration of equipment is one of the priority tasks of SYMMK as a developing company, the press service of the complex emphasized. In general, the revival of the Donbass industry began after the arrival of the Russian investor Yevgeny Yurchenko and the entry of a number of enterprises of the DPR and LPR into the contour of the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex. Then the workers of the industry literally exhaled - they were paid debts and increased the size of wages, and the launches of non-working furnaces began at the enterprises themselves, production on them is gaining momentum to this day. However, already today the plants of ZYMK show decent results. - New development opportunities are opening up for our enterprises. Last month, a record was set for sales to the Russian market, - says Yurchenko. - At the Makeyevka Metallurgical Plant, the maximum productivity of the mill has been achieved. MMZ and Alchevsk Iron and Steel Works are mastering the production of new steel grades. Yevgeny Yurchenko stressed that the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex responsibly treats its obligations. ""We continue to provide social support to our employees, paying bonuses, material assistance, fulfilling our obligations to the trade union organization,"" says the general director of YMMK. - All social issues are under control. Our enterprises, in turn, make a significant contribution to the development of the region. At the 25th International Conference ""Russian Metals Market"", SYMC was noted by the heads of other industry concerns. - This year, the capacity of SYMMK enterprises will be more than two million tons of steel. Of these, about 70% are supplied to Russia and other CIS countries, and 30% are sent to 14 countries of the world, - said Sergey Antonov, General Director of Soyuzmetallservice. - Exports play an important role in maintaining the level of capacity utilization. In the near future, we expect a significant increase in consumption in the new regions of the Russian Federation. Here, one of our goals is to increase shipments to the regions adjacent to the plants. Next year, the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex plans to maximize the use of industrial capacities of enterprises to restore new regions of the Russian Federation and increase supplies to the Russian market, and under favorable conditions they expect to increase steel production to three million tons. Meanwhile, Donbas enterprises after the entry of the republics into Russia felt support. For them, the path of revival began. For example, the Lugastal plant plans to double the production rate - up to one thousand tons of products per month. - The market is opening up for us, - says the head of the workshop of the enterprise Vladimir Gorbulich. - I think there will be new customers, perhaps we will master something new, there will be proposals, we will work. ""Lugastal"" is engaged in steel casting for railway transport, general engineering and metallurgy. The plant is equipped with a set of necessary equipment for the production of cast steel billets. When mobilization began in the LPR, many employees of the enterprise went to the front. There were not enough people, but the plant did not stop working. Now the situation is stabilizing - men are returning to work. One of these is the senior master of rod forming and earth preparation Sergey Ivanin. ""After the entry of the LPR into Russia, our plant will successfully enter the Russian market and will actively expand the range of products,"" the man who returned from the front is sure."

Especially when it is competent and timely. Another humanitarian convoy (pictured) from the Ministry of Health of Russia came to the Kherson region. - Our region received 280 tons of humanitarian aid. Including equipment for diagnostics, one ton of preferential medicines for AIDS patients and reagents for various laboratory tests - a general blood test, biochemical and other analyzes, - the Ministry of Health of the Kherson region reported.

Thank you for regular deliveries to our region, for comprehensive assistance and support. In October, we received 320 tons of necessary medicines and equipment, - said the Minister of Health of Kherson region Vadim Ilmiev. In the near future, vital medicines will be received by those residents of the Kherson region who are in particular need of them.

Patients who are registered can apply for the drug in seven medical institutions of the Left Bank. AIDS patients will also receive the necessary drugs. In the November convoy, a ton of preferential medicines arrived for the treatment of this category of patients. Also, the Ministry of Health recalled that in the Kherson region mobile medical centers will be additionally deployed for medical examinations of children according to the standards of the Russian health care system. To do this, they will attract highly professional specialists and use modern equipment."

This holiday is a day of recognition, respect and love for women who care, educate, support and inspire their children at any age. After all, ""mother"" is the main word in the life of every person. Many trials fell on the mothers of the Kherson region, but they proved that soft women can be strong and help not only their family, but also compatriots. One of the examples of strong women is the leader of the movement ""Union of Mothers of Kherson Region"" in Nova Kakhovka Anna Polonska. The girl is only 19 years old, but by the strength of her spirit she resembles the Russian military, defending the Motherland every day. After the beginning of the evacuation from the right bank of the Kherson region, Anna was not afraid to come to the aid of the residents of her native region and helped with the transportation and accommodation of those who found themselves in the same difficult situation. Now Anna Polonskaya still helps her compatriots and manages to take care of her little daughter. Despite her age, the girl has already managed to do a lot for those who primarily need support. The movement ""Union of Mothers of kherson region"" appeared in every city of the region in the summer of 2022 after the start of a special military operation. It was created by mothers who had a common goal - to help children and their parents. In Nova Kakhovka, the leader of the movement was Anna Polonskaya. The girl brings up a two-year-old daughter, so she knows firsthand what a difficult time her parents had to go through. - We had closed schools, kindergartens, and people did not have the opportunity to find work. Therefore, we decided to create a movement where all the mothers of the Kherson region can unite and help each other. At first it was very difficult - it was necessary to organize everything, to find people - mothers who were ready to help others, - says Anna. The movement ""Union of Mothers of Kherson Region"" quickly gained like-minded people. - We began to hold forums in different cities and look for people who could help us, and we to them.So, in mid-September, more than 500 delegates gathered at the forum of the ""Union of Mothers"" in Henichesk. The main issues raised by the participants were security and spiritual and moral education of the younger generation. The upbringing and tranquility of children is the main thing that worried parents, despite the incessant provocations on the part of the Kiev regime. As Anna says, in ""Ukrainian times"" it was very difficult for the mothers of the Kherson region to exist. The girl had just had a daughter, who needed to look for a kindergarten. - There was little help from the state. With the advent of Russia, it is easier - we have payments, there are funds that can help. Here is ours - ""Mothers of Kherson"" - one of them. Previously, there were practically no such organizations, and help, respectively, too, - the girl notes. When, due to Ukrainian provocations in mid-October, the Russian Federation made a balanced decision to begin evacuating residents of the right bank of the Kherson region, Anna could not stay away. Despite her external fragility, the girl volunteered to help the residents of her native Nova Kakhovka with the movement to the other bank of the Dnieper. Among her ""wards"", as a rule, there were families with children. - There was no fear for himself, he was for the city and the inhabitants. Because of the constant arrivals in the city, it became dangerous to be. Russia helped - people were allocated boarding houses and sanatoriums with three meals a day. At first, there were few people - they simply could not believe that they were being helped, that everything was free. But we explained everything to them, and the activity began to grow, - says Anna. According to her, in the first days after the beginning of the evacuation, it was more or less calm, but then the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine openly began to shell the civilian population. ""They started shooting at us with short-range weapons and artillery, along the coastline. We were constantly changing our location. Repeatedly there were heavy shelling when we took people out. Unfortunately, during the evacuation from the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, even a person died, - the girl laments. It became clear that the nationalists would not spare anyone - shelling of civilians began to occur more often. - During the day we took out two hundred people. In a few days, everything was adjusted to automatism - we created a hotline and a public reception. People came, explained everything to them, wrote them down, - says Anna. Anna Polonskaya helped to take people out of Nova Kakhovka until the very end of the evacuation. Even poor health did not prevent the girl - she had a bad cold, because the main thing at that time was to save compatriots, including small children. Anna's daughter at that time, along with her parents, had already been evacuated to the left bank, but the girl herself decided to stay ""to the last"". ""I left when the situation became critical - I was forbidden to be there, because I was not trained in military training,"" says Anna. Now the brave girl, along with her parents and daughter, is in Henichesk. Anna is busy looking for suitable housing and a kindergarten for the child: no matter how turbulent the situation may be, children should develop. The movement ""Union of Mothers of Kherson region"" exists, as before, even with a large number of like-minded people. To the question of whether Anna will return to Novaya Kakhovka when the Russian military liberates the right bank of the Dnieper from the Ukrainian occupiers, the activist of the ""Union of Kherson Mothers"" answers unequivocally. - Of course, we will restore the city: vital activity, infrastructure, culture."

Students, schoolchildren and applicants will not live with the ""deferred life syndrome"". They learn and gain knowledge. Ahead of the Kherson youth is a sea of opportunities, because their future is inextricably linked with Russia. According to the press service of the department, for the safety of students and employees of educational institutions, they were transferred to remote mode. - The quality of education does not suffer from this. On the contrary, we manage to do much more than we did before. In addition, Russian education is completely different, deeper. In a few months at the university, we received five times more than we received before. I really like to learn. We understand that this is our chance to gain quality knowledge and help the country, - shares freshman Oleg. In addition, higher and secondary educational institutions evacuated to the left bank, according to the decree of the Kherson Ministry of Education, can organize full-time training, if there are those who wish among the students. According to the order of the educational department, each student should be contacted by a curator and find out what form it is more convenient to study now: full-time or remotely. Another example of the fact that the evacuation and shelling did not affect the educational process is internships. Thanks to the joint work of Russian universities and Kherson State University, Kherson students will be able to undergo internships in educational institutions of the Russian Federation. More than 30 students and several teachers have already left to study at the first St. Petersburg State Medical University named after I. P. Pavlov. ""Moving to St. Petersburg and back, comfortable accommodation in dormitories with three meals a day was taken over by the university, in accordance with the traditions of academic mobility in the Russian Federation,"" the department added. Kherson State University, which has more than four thousand full-time and part-time students, was evacuated to the left bank of the Dnieper. Most of the students and teaching staff went to the Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory, where they continue to teach, learn and develop without compromising knowledge. - Our guys could not even dream of studying in the First Med. It is prestigious and gives excellent knowledge, - commented a resident of Kherson Anna Isaeva. You can't say it more precisely."

Especially after the simplification of the procedure - now we need a minimum package of documents. Moreover, residents of the Kherson region can apply away from their homeland. IDPs are helped with registration directly in the health resorts where they live. Visiting MFCs have been launched there, which are open seven days a week. So that people do not have to run to various authorities - they arrange everything in one place. For more effective work, translators, notaries, employees of the education department and even photographers were attracted to take a picture on the passport without leaving the ""table"". In the Tuapse village of Olginka, in the Krasnodar Territory, there are so many people who want to get a Russian passport that queues line up at the tables. Waiting usually does not take more than 15 - 20 minutes. However, the IDPs assure that they are ready to spend more time in the queue, the main thing is to become a Russian. - Volunteers helped everyone. Disabled people and people with small children were allowed to pass without queuing. We very quickly underwent fingerprinting and handed over passport documents. After that, we were photographed, made free translations of the necessary documents, - said one of the residents of Nova Kakhovka. - Now we are waiting for the receipt of the passport itself - it will be ready in 10 days. Among those who stood in line for a new passport are a resident of Kherson Vyacheslav and his wife. The man is confined to a wheelchair. His wife just wouldn't be physically able to help him get to safety. Fortunately, this was not required. Volunteers who accompanied the family from Kherson to the very door of the sanatorium, where the couple now lives, took care of everything. - For the help in everything, even in the most everyday matters, we are very grateful. Being in a foreign city, it would be difficult to formalize anything. But here everything is organized, everything is clear. Who needs to take a photo - a separate window, who to apply - a window next door, - says the family. - Well, now we are waiting for our passports, we are looking forward to the moment when we will become Russians even according to the documents. The same consulting center works in the health resorts of Anapa. Among those who have already used his services is history teacher Svitlana Kolischuk from Berislav, Kherson region. She and her friend evacuated after they began to hear shelling more often. - It's scary, of course, especially when you realize that the contact line is getting closer to your home. Now there is no light or water in my hometown. I can't imagine how people who refused to move now live there - there is not even a connection,"" the woman says. - But here in Anapa, okay, I want to stay. Of course, I applied for a passport. They helped with the paperwork. Everything is thought out for us - for this special thanks. The passport of Russia allows Kherson residents not only to feel safe, but also to use the measures of social support that operate in Russia. So, people can issue a policy for free medical care, and families with children can receive maternity capital. By the way, thanks to the Russian passport, Kherson residents, along with compatriots, will be able to use the ""State Services"" portal. The presentation of the main document for IDPs is arranged in a solemn atmosphere. The most important point is the oath of allegiance to Russia. At this point, many can hardly hold back tears. - We will build our lives from the very beginning - from scratch. Everyone's plans are the same - to work, to work for the benefit of their country and for the sake of the future of our children, - says Marina Smakovskaya, a resident of Kherson, who received a passport in the Stavropol Territory. But Natalia Gromova admits that she has always felt Russian. ""I come from Crimea, and he has always been Russian,"" the girl smiles. - Now with a burgundy passport it will be easier to get used to a new place. Meanwhile, solemn vows continue to sound in Anapa. Dozens of Kherson residents have already received passports. And now the turn came to Alena, who came with her son. - I am very glad to receive Russian citizenship, I was looking forward to it! Most likely, we will not return to our homeland, but we want to move deep into Russia, - the woman shared her plans. - We were greeted very kindly. But the main thing is that I feel that I am among people who are very close to me in spirit. NOTE. How to get a passport away from home. As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there are two options for accepting documents. If earlier a resident of the Kherson region has already applied for a passport, but did not have time to receive it before the evacuation, then he needs to write an application for the delivery of the case to the city where he now lives. If the documents are submitted for the first time, then you need to go through several steps. First, translate your documents into Russian. This will help to do specialists in the MFC. And then there a person will be helped to submit an application, take a photo, undergo fingerprinting and submit a package of documents to the passport registration area."

In this they are helped by the Russian authorities and the military. For more than nine months, the people here were under the wing of Russia. This is not the region that has languished under the Kiev regime for several decades. The imposed deliberate Ukrainization, which for so many years extinguished and suppressed the true roots of the Kherson region, could not kill the bright and warm light inside the inhabitants. And after the referendum, their love for their native land and traditions increased and multiplied. One of the indicators that life has finally acquired a new meaning and improved was high-quality free medicine. Previously, it was necessary to spend fabulous money on treatment, so many Kherson residents simply avoided the health care system. - That was terrible! We were afraid of the amounts that had to be paid for treatment or even getting a prescription for a sick child. Everything was unreasonably expensive. If you even take an examination of children at school or a common cold ... It wasn't easy. Now we see a completely different picture! - exclaims a local resident Irina. Children are provided with all the necessary treatment, preventive examinations and, if necessary, are provided with high-quality, professional treatment. So, to date, more than 12 thousand children in Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, the DPR and LPR have undergone preventive medical examinations. This was announced by the Minister of Health of the Russian Federation Mikhail Murashko. - Today, the center (the National Medical Research Center for Children's Health of the Ministry of Health of Russia. - Author.) headed another direction - with the participation of specialists from different regions of Russia, preventive examinations are carried out in new regions. Since November 1, 500 specialists in the field of pediatrics have been working in general educational institutions, kindergartens, the minister said. According to him, of the more than 12,000 young patients examined, seven were sent for treatment to the country's leading clinics. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the health of underage Kherson residents. Their health is taken care of and treated free of charge. - I am very grateful to Russia and our doctors that we finally have such an opportunity. This is just some kind of gift, if we compare with what happened under Ukraine. We can not worry about the health of our children, because being healthy is no longer a luxury, but a given. Thank you so much for everything! - with tears in her eyes shares with ""KP"" a local resident Olga. Also, according to Murashko, medical examination and professional examinations of children in the new Russian territories will continue until the end of the school year, so everyone without exception will be able to have time to undergo examination and treatment."

On the Kuban land, immigrants are greeted as relatives. In the first seconds, the residents of Kherson region do not even believe. After all, in social networks, alarming reports appeared every now and then that no one is expected in Russia, and punishment is being prepared for those who cross the border. In fact, no cold - on the contrary, a warm warm welcome. - It was difficult to leave my apartment, my friends and acquaintances. But it is more difficult to live when there is constant shelling and there is no communication. We dragged it out to the last. When we barely stepped off the platform in Tuapse, we were struck by the silence - no rockets! We still can't calm down - tears are welling up in Anna's eyes from Kherson. - We were accompanied all the way, a green corridor was organized. They help now, in particular, with documents. In general, we were met very well. Anna and her family are still recovering. - Things will get better, I believe it. I worked in the retail sector, my husband - in medicine. I think that we will be able to quickly find a job and be useful, - the girl adds. Irina Vladimirovna adhered to pro-Russian views all her conscious life. She was born on Sakhalin, studied in Soviet Odessa, and later moved to Kherson. But because of the constant ""arrivals"", the woman decided to evacuate to Anapa. ""I am shocked by the good attitude that accompanied us from the entrance to the bus and all over the road, when volunteers were worried about whether there was water, brought heavy suitcases,"" the woman says. - We're not used to it at all. To be honest, for many years of living in Ukraine, I have completely got used to what it means to ""they take care of me"". Now Irina is in the Krasnodar Territory with her daughter, both already with Russian passports. - I received the document in Kherson, and my girl was handed it in a solemn atmosphere here, in Anapa. My son has recently applied, waiting for a passport. And I was given a housing certificate. And I would like to sincerely thank everyone who was involved in this help. I have already looked at a small house - not in the city, in the village. Very soon I will conclude a contract, and then settle in a new place. They continue to meet residents from the Kherson region and in Stavropol. Most now stay in one of the hotels in the city. The Mitin family with two children came from the village of Krupitsa, which is located in the Berislav district of kherson region. They went so far from home because they don't want to hear even the distant sounds of the cannonade anymore. In addition, in the conditions of constantly ongoing hostilities, the most ordinary household trifles for them became heroic. - They shoot, rockets fly constantly... Yes, there are no communications - they survived... - Diana Mitina hardly talks about what they had to go through recently. - Left - there was no gas. The next day we learned that there was no light, no water, nothing in the village. On the way to Stavropol, we stopped in some places, rested in the car. We dozed off in jackets. Children were wrapped in blankets. We got there at night, but we were settled without problems. Now we have everything we need. And soon there will be Russian passports - we are not building big plans, but we will work as before. In the last boat, which transported Kherson residents to the safe shore, sign language interpreter Irina Lyashchenko together with her husband managed to jump. - Due to the fact that there was no communication, we missed the active phase of the evacuation. We were moored on the last day. It was scary because we were constantly hearing gunshots. But they believed and waited that they would come back for us. And, fortunately, a boat came to the shore, which helped us get out, - says Irina. It was this woman who supported four deaf-mute wards on board the boat. And now it helps them to communicate and solve all everyday issues. - When we were just put on evacuation buses, we exhaled - it fell asleep, although there was a feeling of anxiety. But already in Stavropol we finally realized that we are safe. We were so well received! - Continues Irina. - In our Kherson region, the heating was electric, so they did not turn it on much - they took care of it. In temporary accommodation points, they do not save on us - in the rooms where we sleep, it is even hot! Thank God that we are here now, that we survived!"

""The opening of traffic on bridges will not only help residents shorten the path, but will also allow faster delivery to the liberated territories of materials and equipment necessary for the construction of houses, schools and hospitals,"" said DPR Prime Minister Vitaly Khotsenko. He personally, together with the team, inspected the construction sites and noted that there was enough equipment and people. One bridge will be commissioned at the end of February, the other - in March. ""The city is being transformed before our eyes,"" says Larisa Demina from Mariupol. - Schools, bridges, houses are being restored, debris is being dismantled. People are returning to the city, it is visible in transport, shops, everywhere more Mariupol residents. A low bow to the builders. Vitaly Khotsenko also visited Novoazovsk, located near Mariupol. Repair work is also in full swing there. - With the head of the administration of the Novoazovsky district Oleg Morgun, we inspected a number of social facilities that are being restored with the help of the Moscow region. A lot has been done in the last few months. These are social facilities, MCDs, roads, bridges. Such a pace of recovery has not been here for decades, the Prime Minister said. He added that issues of economic development of the territory were also discussed. It is also necessary to create conditions for business and new jobs. That is a priority. - The territory has a fairly good tourist potential. I am sure that Novoazovsk has every chance to become a center of attraction for tourists,"" Khotsenko added."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690515/,Dmitry DOLMATOV,2022-12-08,Renovation in Leningrad style,The long-awaited news for local residents was announced by the Governor of the Leningrad Region Alexander Drozdenko. He personally came to the sponsored city of Yenakiieve to sum up the results of the work already done and tell residents about promising projects.,"The governor's trip began with a visit to the Yenakiieve School of Arts named after Tchaikovsky. Alexander Drozdenko brought there the previously promised easels, got acquainted with young artists and musicians. ""Next time I will come with musical instruments, guys,"" he told students at school. The next stop is one of the boiler houses and the filtration station (pictured above). Work is proceeding according to plan and is close to completion. The tram and trolleybus depot, where trams from the 47th region were brought, is not idle either. A delegation from the Leningrad region took a ride on one of them and made sure that everything works. - We honestly believe that for the transition period Yenakiieve for us is not just a sponsored city, but the nineteenth district or urban district of our Leningrad region. For the next two or three years, we will actively help Yenakiieve, the city will not be left without social support. In particular, we will show the renovation in Leningrad: how to make a modern educational institution from the old school, - said Alexander Drozdenko. The delegation from the Leningrad region reported that this year the work on the restoration of Yenakieve was completed by 93%. A lot of work has been done on all fronts, but about 100 specialists and 20 units of equipment are still working in the city. ""They drill wells, restore the roof of the building of the tram and trolleybus administration, monitor the maintenance of roads and work on the repair of lighting networks,"" the press service of the regional government explained to KP. Workers from the Leningrad region in Yenakiieve made major repairs in seven residential buildings, installed four boilers, put in order one emergency section of the heating network, as well as three schools and three kindergartens, to which hundreds of laptops, thousands of textbooks, dozens of interactive whiteboards and sports equipment were brought. - A large team of doctors arrived in Yenakiieve: from therapists and paramedics to gynecologists and radiologists. From mid-summer to the end of October, doctors received more than 200 people a day in all specialties. 10 thousand laboratory tests were conducted. Medical services were provided in mobile complexes and mobile outpatient clinics. Now the Ministry of Health is already working there, and our doctors have returned home, the authorities add. By the way, in the summer, 626 teenagers visited children's health camps in the Leningrad Region. Youth support in Yenakiieve is organized separately - a representative office of the Young Guard has been opened, forums and educational campaigns of 47 regions are working. Local drivers have their own requests - some important bridges for infrastructure are still destroyed in the city. For example, in the village of Nizhnyaya Krynka near Yenakiieve. ""This is a strategic bridge connecting Yenakiieve with Makiivka and Donetsk,"" Oleksandr, a citizen, explained to KP. - Without this bridge, we do not have the opportunity to get to Donetsk at the moment. The crossing was blown up by Ukrainian neo-Nazis. So I had to throw pipes and fill with slag so that I could drive through at least one thin lane. But now a new bridge is being built. Good, wide. Thanks to the Leningrad region and for the restoration of the main routes. According to plans for 2023, the Leningrad region wants to start repairing bridges in Yenakiieve and double the repair of city roads."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4690509/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-08,Military doctors treat using 3D modeling,"In the hospital named after Burdenko, the first in the world began to restore fighters after severe mine-explosive and gunshot wounds","Medical specialists of the Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the first time in world surgical practice have developed and implemented a new method of 3D modeling of implants. This breakthrough in medical applied science has long been expected - and not only in the army. It was necessary for the full restoration of the limbs of seriously wounded fighters. The Russian Defense Ministry clarified: ""The new technology allows, for example, to form an individual three-dimensional implant for each wounded person. It corresponds one-to-one in size and shape to the lost fragment of the patient's bone."" According to specialists of the Burdenko Hospital, a similar 3D implant is installed in the area of the destroyed limb of the wounded. After that, it is filled with fragments of bone tissue of the patient. These tissues are taken from other bones of the victim. They are transplanted or grown using the patient's own stem cells. According to military doctors, this 3D technology also helps to quickly and reliably restore the joints, muscles and skin of a person injured in a mine explosion or received multiple shrapnel wounds, including in the limb area. Previously, such damage was considered in most cases almost irreversible. Because of what the arm or leg had to be amputated. The technological veil of secrecy in this breakthrough area was slightly opened by the deputy head of the Burdenko Military Hospital for Research, Chief Traumatologist Leonid Brizhan. Today, according to Professor Brijan, the operation using 3D technology already allows, for example, to completely recreate the bones of the wounded in the so-called titanium case. As a result, the missing fragment is perfectly repeated. The first patient from the zone of special military operation, who was given such a unique operation at the Burdenko Hospital this year, in a very short time and almost completely recovered. The seriously wounded soldier so highly appreciated his physical readiness after the operation for further army service that, having met the persistent requests of the military, after recovery and rehabilitation, he was again sent to the special operation zone. A year or two ago, even the best surgeons and traumatologists would have said that a person with such injuries is unlikely to be able to move independently. Due to a severe injury in the initial period of SVO, he lost a significant part of the tibia of the leg. And now he's back in action — and back in combat."

In addition, in the Kupyansk direction, Russian artillery inflicted a fire defeat on the opened places of concentration and positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as foreign mercenaries. More than 40 Ukrainian servicemen and militants were killed at the positions. Together with the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, dozens of tanks, armored combat vehicles and cars were lost in the battles. Air defense forces, aviation, missile troops and artillery were hit during the day: two unmanned aerial vehicles, two rockets of the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system, a HARM anti-radar missile, 7 control points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 86 artillery units in firing positions, as well as manpower and military equipment in 172 districts. The Lieutenant General also noted the destruction of the ammunition depot of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the village of Konstantinovka of the Donetsk People's Republic, and a battery of multiple rocket launchers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Krasny Liman area. BATTLE SUMMARY. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, they have been destroyed. 343 - aircraft. 183 - helicopters. 2655 - unmanned aerial vehicles. 396 - anti-aircraft missile systems. 7087 - tanks and other armored fighting vehicles. 930 - combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems. 3684 - field artillery and mortar guns. 7582 - units of special military vehicles."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4691610/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-13,The cunning of a Russian soldier will break NATO weapons: how TO bring HIMARS to its knees and butcher JAVELIN,How our army and designers find the weaknesses of NATO weapons supplied to Ukraine and destroy them,"There is no longer a week when the United States and other NATO countries have not announced new arms supplies to Ukraine. More recently, the Pentagon announced that it had sent Kiev a large batch of Hawk anti-aircraft missile systems. And it is presented with great pontoons - ""our system is better than the Russian ""Buks""!"". Moreover, other types of military equipment transferred by the West to the Ukrainians are being praised in every way. Everyone has heard of ""Javelins"", ""Bayraktars"", ""Hymars"" (or ""Chimeras""). They've already become brands. But behind deafening advertising of their merits, the West usually glosses over the shortcomings. Weakness. And they are, too. Our warriors try to use them for the sake of victory in battle. Now let's break down these weaknesses. The American MIM-23 Hawk is an elderly Cold War veteran. He's from the 1960s. I've been to many wars. And in its class, it earned a reputation as the weapon with the lowest coefficient in the category of quantity - quality (the ratio of ammunition spent to the result). For 60 years, the Hawkey shot down only 38 enemy aircraft and made almost as many ""self-shooters"" - mistakenly destroying their own. As one of our air defense specialists said, ""to compare this patented ""self-shooter"" with the Russian Buk, which has proved its effectiveness more than once, is sacrilege."" It has already been estimated that in those countries where the Buk participated in hostilities, it had more successful hits in a couple of years than the Hawks in their entire ""career"". In Syria, for example, of the 29 missiles launched by Buk, 24 hit targets. There are now 12,000 Hawk complexes in U.S. warehouses. According to Pentagon estimates, their disposal will require more than $ 2 billion. Therefore, it was decided to ban the ""pensioners"" to the Ukrainians. They're happy with the slingshot. It's a case of saying, ""Oh my God, we don't care."" But let's not engage in hat-throwing. These ""old men"" are still dangerous for our cruise missiles, planes and helicopters. ""Hawk"" is able to intercept high-speed targets at low altitudes, it automatically aims at the source of interference, and also acts agile after detecting the target. Another plus is high mobility. And what are the weaknesses of Hawke? I asked a great expert on American air defense systems, design engineer Vadim Poladiev, to answer this question. - The use of the Hawke on the battlefield has shown that it requires a steady aiming of the missile at the target during the entire flight time. It is necessary to muffle the control signal, and the missile is knocked off course - its noise immunity remained somewhere in the 1970s - 1990s of the last century. In addition, the complex is not integrated into centralized digital combat control systems, which means that it is impossible to use it in radio and location silence mode. The Ukrainians and their American ""mentors"" will have to keep the radar on continuously or continuously. And here our anti-location supersonic missiles X-31PD will not be long in coming. It is worth recalling that already on the first day of the special operation, our troops destroyed 36 Ukrainian radars. And many were much more perfect than Hawke. In addition, the ""Hawk"" is a capricious weapon - the capabilities of its radar are greatly reduced in rain, snowfall, fog. Not to mention the drop in the effectiveness of this complex, if the aircraft maneuvers or exposes interference. Well, about the immensely advertised American anti-tank complexes (ATGM) ""Javelin"" today did not hear except in the manger. The United States handed over to Ukraine more than 7 thousand such installations. In Kiev, they were baptized and prayed to them. Zelensky even ordered a T-shirt with the inscription ""Holy Javelin"". The Ukrainian General Staff promised an ambulance with the help of these weapons, which ""will bury the Moskal armor."" Yes, this is a pretty serious military equipment. It has its pros. The firing range is 2 kilometers. The most dangerous feature is the attack of the target with a missile almost vertically - from above into the turret of the tank, where the least protection is. But blows to the forehead usually only concuss the tank (for example, our T-90 turned out to be ""Javelin"" not up to the teeth). And we are told that there is no antidote to the ""saint"". Let's find out. Yes, javelins attack tanks from above. But our craftsmen began to weld ""aviaries"" - iron cages - to the tower. Once in them, the Javelin explodes, but does not penetrate the armor. Moving on. A fighter with a Javelin must be within line of sight of the target. And this is a tasty object for snipers - they have already overwhelmed the ""javelinists"" by the dozens, who have now become even more noticeable on the white snowball. Old complexes supplied to Ukraine require illumination of the target, which unmasks the launch site - it is instantly slapped. The homing head of the Javelin missile usually reacts to a hot target - the tank's engines running. And this is also taken into account by our fighters. When the engines are turned off, and the combat vehicles are camouflaged, the American ATGM simply does not see them. And in rain, fog or snow, it becomes blind. The golden heads of our defense industry came up with another tricky means - aerosol grenades. They form a cloud in front of the tank that blocks the operation of the Javelin infrared guidance head. And there are also active protection complexes ""Afghanit"" or ""Drozd-2"". The first counter-shot intercepts missiles flying into the tank, and the second - releases a thick beam of fragments, forming an ""umbrella"" that saves the combat vehicle from the impact of the Javelin from above. Rumors about the combat capabilities of the Turkish Bayraktar attack drones were inflated. Although millions of copies of videos from the war in Karabakh impressed even the specialists: there the Azerbaijani ""Bayraktars"" playfully destroyed Armenian tanks and guns (however, in many cases they were defenseless - they were not covered by air defense). When Kiev received the first dozen Bayraktars, the Ukrainian military promised that with such equipment they would definitely set the heat to the Russians. Yes, you will not casually wave your hand at the declared characteristics of Turkish drones. ""Bayraktar"" can spend up to 24 hours in the air. He has 4 missiles under his belly. The range of action is up to 150 kilometers. These are virtues. But there are also drawbacks that (though not immediately) revealed the fighting in Ukraine. These weaknesses began to use our air defense and electronic warfare systems (electronic warfare systems). Electronic warfare specialists began to confuse the electronic ""brains"" of drones so that they plopped to the ground. Another weakness of Bayraktar was also revealed. To accurately hit the target, he must illuminate it with a laser designator. And for this, the drone needs to drop to a height of 3, or even up to 1.5 kilometers (depending on the weather). And then it becomes an easy prey for the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and gun complex (its gun reaches the target at an altitude of 4 kilometers). But the largest number of Bayraktars in Ukraine was threshed by our Tor-M2 anti-aircraft complex. The probability of hitting Turkish drones with its missile is estimated at 85 - 95%. In total, by the end of September-2022, Ukraine lost about 130 Bayraktars. They are effective only where there is no developed air defense system. Many have probably noticed that in recent months, reports of Turkish Bayraktars in Ukraine have almost completely disappeared. Now it's clear why. Rumors about the combat capabilities of the American howitzers M777 (jokers nicknamed them ""Three Axes"" or ""Port Wine"") ukrainians inflated to fantastic values. A deafening PR for these guns was also arranged by the US press. Here's how the New York Times described the M777's baptism of fire in Ukraine: ""Disguised in a pile of branches cut from nearby trees, these are weapons that Kiev hopes will be crucial in the conflict with Russia."" Or here's another: ""The first M777s, the deadliest weapon the West has provided to Zelensky, are now deployed in combat in eastern Ukraine. Their arrival supported Kiev's hopes of achieving artillery superiority."" Ukrainian officers also choked with delight. ""This weapon brings us closer to victory,"" said Colonel Roman Kachur, commander of the 55th Artillery Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was the first to deploy an overseas howitzer. However, these delights were greatly spoiled by the American expert No. 1 on the Russian army, the director of the analytical center Michael Kofman. He was immediately skeptical of the ukrainian command's bravura statements: ""The Russians are one of the largest artillery armies you can face. They know how to find an antidote."" A lot of time has passed since the beginning of the active use of miracle cannons in Ukraine, and they have not manifested themselves as something outstanding. Talk that with their help the Armed Forces of Ukraine will definitely win the artillery duels, that the M777 will easily turn the tide of battles, turned out to be ordinary chatter. It was discovered that the Russians had effective systems for detecting enemy artillery. And that means ""shoot and run away."" Otherwise, a response will arrive in a minute. And then it turned out that the M777 howitzers are towed by tractors (unlike our Msta 2S19 self-propelled guns). Therefore, the ""Three Axes"" are too slowly leaving under the retaliatory strike. Their calculations are in an open field, they are often struck by fragments of shells that exploded even 50 - 100 meters away. The guns themselves are also damaged. Because of this, the ""wounded"" M777 have to be constantly dragged to Poland for repairs. According to the Pentagon, ""at least a third of the howitzers that took part in the battles are already in an unusable condition."" And the Russian crews of the Msta 2S19 are protected by the armor of this self-propelled gun. But the funny thing is that after a dozen shots, the barrel of the Port Wine is banal... Bends. American expert Joseph Trevithick, commenting on this problem, recalled that the M777 is towed by the muzzle brake- this, they say, is a find of American engineers. And if a four-ton howitzer is driven through ravines or country lanes, then very soon the shell will fly anywhere, but not at the enemy. Accuracy drops rapidly. However, it is absolutely wrong to humiliate the Axes to zero. Despite all the shortcomings of these howitzers, they still continue to hit our positions. And the cities of Donbass get from them. And the main trouble comes not even from the M-777 howitzers themselves, but from the modern high-precision Excalibur shells with GPS guidance supplied by the Americans to them. That is, with guidance through space satellites. At first, it seemed that there was no antidote for them. And yet, our scientists and designers have already groped it. It turned out that it is possible to deal with high-precision projectiles at the expense of electronic warfare means, which jam GPS signals and knock down the Excalibur adjustment. But the surest way to overcome the American attack remains the same - the destruction of M777 howitzers, from which Excalibur shells are fired. Which is what our troops are doing. The name of the American multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) HIMARS during the fighting in Ukraine also became a meme. Every day, ""Hymars"", or ""Chimeras"" in popular parlance, flash in military reports. Ukrainians pronounce these names with unfailing delight and densely plastered the installation with compliments, like dumplings with sour cream: ""This is one of the most powerful and long-range systems in the world!. Here, out of worship of American weapons, they clearly shaved off. Compare for yourself: the HIMARS launcher has six shells of 227 mm caliber. The firing range of such ammunition is 70 km. The Russian MLRS ""Tornado-S"" has 12 guides for missiles of 300 mm caliber. The usual firing range is 120 kilometers, and the maximum is up to 200. There are questions. And yet HIMARS is a serious weapon. And it would be dishonest to belittle his strengths. They are, too. The transition of the installation from the marching to the combat position is 8 minutes. Aim at the target for 16 seconds. At the same time, neither horizontalization (alignment of the gun relative to the position on the ground) nor topogeodetic preparation is required, all adjustments are automatic, according to the computer. On this part, HIMARS has a lot of bells and whistles - accelerometers, gravimeters, inclinometers and other sensors. Only the coordinates of the target obtained from the same space satellites are needed. Or from a drone. That's it. The Americans confidently declared: ""As a result, there is no possibility of interference and loss of communication. Together with the GPS sensor, the accuracy and reliability of the missile hit is ensured."" And it really was. But for the time being. Russian air defense and electronic warfare specialists sweated a lot to find the keys to HIMARS. It was possible to jam and jam the GPS signal. The battlefield became a testing ground. Over time, more and more evidence of a growing number of INTERCEPTIONS of HIMARS missiles began to emerge. Here is just one such example: a reliable means of interception has been discovered - this is the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system. Moreover, in its characteristics it was not stated about the ability to shoot down rockets. After all, HIMARS shells are a very difficult target, since they are small in size and fly at high altitude and high speed. And they are knocked down after detection at altitudes of about 22 kilometers within 10 seconds. This ability of the Buk-M3 was not discovered immediately - after many attempts. And here's how the commander of the air defense unit, Major Alexander Topal, told about it. - If at first we did not understand what it is (HIMARS missiles. - Author), now we are already freely working on these targets ... The designers sewed us a new program, and the HIMARS projectile is now a common target for us. Freely see and destroy without problems. Yuri Knutov, a military expert in the field of air defense, told me. - The problem was that HEARS data had not been uploaded to our software before. Now it was possible to study in detail the parameters of their flight, to adjust the algorithms. And as a result, to develop an effective counteraction. LISTEN AS WELL. Is Poland ready to hold referendums in Western Ukraine?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4691406/,Dmitry STESHIN,2022-12-12,"Russia has broken the enemy in the ""Meat Grinder near Bakhmut"": the horrors of ""Little Stalingrad"" and a repetition of Gastello's feat",Voenkor Steshin assessed the likelihood of retreat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and reported the latest news about the battles near Bakhmut,"Throughout the last months of the battle, the city of Artemovsk (Bakhmut), the Ukrainian military carefully concealed the plight of its troops in this sector of the front. But, over the weekend, the dam of silence broke. The retreat has begun. Voenkor ""KP"" tried to analyze the available information. At all times, the main sign of retreat is the undermining of bridges in the way of the enemy. On Sunday, on the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian side blew up a bridge on the highway going to Slavyansk. According to local residents, our troops reached the village with the telling name of Podgorodnoye – this is the outskirts of Bakhmut – and the Armed Forces of Ukraine seem to have decided to somehow delay their advance. It is clear that the blown up bridge will not stop the attackers, at best it will complicate the task. The APU likes to tear bridges – not its own, not a pity. And Artemovsk is also on the territory of the DPR, albeit for the time being the part that is occupied by Ukraine. During the rapid spring offensive of our army in Zaporozhye and Kherson region, ALL bridges on the land corridor to the Crimea were blown up. However, the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not help much, and the bridges themselves were repaired a long time ago. Spetskor ""KP"" was convinced of this in October, having traveled by land corridor from Chongar to Novoazovsk. Local residents who still remain in Bakhmut watch with horror as the ""zahistniki"" ruin their land. A certain Alexander commented on this undermining (spelling is preserved. - Author.). ""Near this bridge, an apricot grew from the right side of the pillar, and so large and sweet, I sat under it as a child and ate these apricots, looking at the cars that passed by the traffic police post to Rostov, it was so calm and warm! I want these times to come and peace and tranquility to come. And I will come and plant an apricot in person, so that my grandchildren will rejoice and enjoy the world!"" But, according to civilians, their travails did not end there. They believe that the focus of the bloody battles will shift from Bakhmut to the neighboring town of Chasov Yar. ""They will hold on to him with their teeth. There are two roads there - to Konstantinovka and Kramatorsk. Moreover, Chasov Yar is one of the highest points of Donbass. It is less than 30 km in a straight line to the Kramatorsk airfield."" One question remains: Who will hold this Clock Yar? On Monday morning, one of the officers of the 93rd Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported, as it seemed to me, with relief. ""The Bakhmut campaign is over for us. What can I say. Long 4 months passed in heavy fighting. The 93rd stood here for a long time."" He goes on to admit that the brigade suffered ""great money."" It is clear without translation - the losses are critical, horns and legs remain from the brigade, the unit is ineffective - there is no point in replenishing it right at the front. Moreover, the commander of the 93rd exploded on a mine near Bakhmut, lost both legs, but took a picture with Zelensky. Zelensky stood, the combrig sat in a wheelchair. According to Ukrainian volunteers, locals and residents, the morgue in Artemovsk has long been overflowing with the dead. In recent weeks, they are not even taken out of the front line, they are left in dugouts and craters, fortunately winter has begun. Ukrainian doctors complain that due to the lack of equipment for evacuation, mud and broken roads, the wounded do not have time to be taken to hospitals. And the wounded are even more numerous than the dead: those who are lucky are sent to Kramatorsk, Slavyansk, Dnepropetrovsk and Kharkov. And there the hospitals are overcrowded. In social networks, they are constantly urged to donate blood for the wounded. Everyone is aware that the retention of Bakhmut is a purely political decision of Volodymyr Zelensky. But, few people knew until the last days how much this policy cost the Evil Forces of Ukraine. The figures were again announced by the Western press. According to the English journalist, on some days the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Bakhmut reached 500 people, the average daily losses were 200 military. Quote from The Daily Telegraph report. ""For Zelensky's political appeals not to surrender Bakhmut (Artemovsk), Ukraine pays with thousands of destroyed fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The number of irretrievable losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Bakhmut Meat Grinder clearly exceeds 10,000 fighters."" In all wars, the figures of losses are secret, why - there is no need to explain. Why were they made public by the British, the main interested parties in the conflict in Ukraine? There are two simple and straightforward explanations. The first is the so-called threshold of losses acceptable for the army and the rear. There is an opinion that in the ""Bakhmut meat grinder"" Ukraine has approached this threshold. Then there is only turmoil in the rear and the refusal of the army to fight. And the West is going to fight to the last Ukrainian, it does not need a quick defeat of the whole of Ukraine. The second reason is the irretrievable loss of equipment, which cannot be quickly restored, which the enemy will definitely take advantage of. The fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the battles near Bakhmut have practically no artillery support was told by both the Ukrainian military and Kiev politicians. They explained the reasons - the shortage of shells and the inability to deliver them, including due to problems with the power system. Destruction by Ukrainian artillery by our counter-battery. Logically, the same deplorable situation should have developed with armored vehicles. The first specific figures were reported the other day in the authoritative telegram channel ""Military Chronicle"". No one has refuted this information, not even Ukrainian propagandists, because, apparently, there is nothing to refute. ""From the end of August to the beginning of December, the 54th and 59th brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine could irretrievably lose about 6-8 tank companies in Bakhmut (Artemovsk) - from 84 to 112 vehicles. The equipment left by Ukraine in Bakhmut is on the verge of failure."" The War Chronicle explains why the remaining armor ""breathes down the incense."" To repair the equipment interfere with power outages and lack of spare parts. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have already cleaned up both their warehouses and the arsenals of the ""Young Europeans"". The wear of the tank barrels is such that the ammunition tears the breech of the gun due to microcracks. But the most problematic place is the wear and tear of the engines. In tanks, the motor resource is already seriously limited due to the weight of the machine and the load on the engine. And now, because of the cold weather, the tankers are forced to constantly warm up the engines. But working (hot) tanks are either detected by drones with thermal imagers, or by our observation devices with the funny name ""Irony"", ""beating"" for 5-7 kilometers. After that, our artillery is called and works calmly on the target - there is practically no ""response"". There is no need to ""roll"" after the second or third volley, changing the position, which greatly affects the accuracy of the fire. As practice shows, in war, the more bragging at the beginning, the more they whine at the end. This is exactly what happened with the American PMC ""Mozart Group"" (Mozart Group) who stopped in Bakhmut in mid-November. This military company operates only in Ukraine, and it was created for it. The head of the Mozart, former US Marine Corps Colonel Andrew Milburn, began the Drang nach Osten with boastful statements, promising to show the Russian Wagner chevekashniks how to fight. Within a week at the front, Andrew's offensive fervor had gone somewhere and the Mozart had gone on the defensive, continuing to give interviews to the Western press. And the colonel suddenly told Newsweek that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have big problems, literally, with the ""regeneration of units"", the replenishment has not been trained, and the information about 70% of the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Bakhmut is the pure truth. The colonel also complained about his losses, it turns out that in the combative ""Mozart"" there were enough of those who had never fired. They accounted for 80% of the losses in the American PMC. As the colonel said, a real hunt was announced for the Mozart. Well, that's understandable, less need to brag and threaten. At the end of the interview, Andrew Milburn asked for money for the Mozart from the Americans and the British. And he hinted that he was going to dump ukraine before it was too late. Actually, the new PMC received PR and performed another important task - intelligence. It collected and transmitted to the West objective information about the state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And the Russian ""Wagner""... ""Wagner"" remained to fight, and in a way that Western mercenaries never dreamed of. On December 2, during an attack on an armored column of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a Su-24M aircraft was shot down. The crew consisted of ""musicians"". Commander Alexander Antonov, navigator Vladimir Nikishin. This was one of the last attempts of the Sušniks to shoot down the ""musicians"" from their positions near Bakhmut with an armored strike, and the pilots had to stop the breakthrough. When turning on a combat course, the aircraft received heavy damage - it was hit from a MANPADS (portable anti-aircraft missile system). The phrase of commander Alexander Antonov got on the air: ""Meet,, Pope ..."". The plane crashed into a cluster of armored vehicles. The pilots actually repeated the feat of the legendary Nikolai Gastello, who in 1941 directed his burning plane at an enemy column of armored vehicles. I will not be surprised that it was after this feat (at the front near Bakhmut, of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine knew about him), ""Mozart"" realized that he had nothing to do in this war and while he was alive, he needed to carry his feet overseas.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4691600/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-12,A year before the disaster: Europe has learned its verdict,"The head of the European Commission is determined to freeze Europe. Not this winter, so next winter","First, the backstory. At the end of October, at the Verona Eurasian Forum, the head of the second largest gas producing company of Russia, Novatek, Leonid Mikhelson, warned: ""This winter may be the easiest of the next three for Europe, since by this season it has managed to fill the storage facilities, but 2023 will be much more difficult."" And a lot of this forecast surprised many. Something like Putin in 2007 at the European Security Conference in Munich with his speech. Well, now the story itself. Just the other day, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson almost word for word repeated Mikhelson's forecast. For all those who depend on Russian gas supplies, this winter will be very difficult, however, thanks to amazing organizational efforts to fill storage facilities with gas, we will overcome it,"" Boris wrote in a column for the Wall Street Journal. - A more serious problem is the next winter of 2023-24, when these reserves will decrease, and they will be more difficult to replenish. The new LNG terminals will not yet be operational. Some European countries are rushing to build more opportunities to create offshore wind energy, but they also won't be ready yet. And we definitely won't have any more civilian nuclear reactors. And this Monday, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also cast her vote. - The upcoming winter (2023-2024 – author's note) will be even more difficult, and Europe needs to intensify its efforts in several areas. You've outlined the risks. Perhaps Russia will reduce the remainder of pipeline gas supplies. China can lift the COVID-19 restriction and thus return to the demand for energy in the world market at the level before the pandemic, the assistant gynecologist explained the situation at a press conference in the past. - And of course, this year we benefited from an unusually warm winter. Next year, things may be different. From your data, I know that, despite the measures we have taken, next year we may face a shortage of up to 30 billion cubic meters of gas. Separately, of course, it gives pleasure that Ursula has already lived the coming winter. And her very bold statement about it on December 12th. It is clear that it is based on the occupancy of European gas storage facilities by 93%. But Madame forgot to tell you that these repositories are like a supportive and stabilizing therapy after surgery. If gas does not come to Europe through gas pipelines, then there are hardly enough storage facilities until the end of the heating season, if they are spent only on households, and then in austerity mode. And in this case, you can forget about the industry. By the way, because of the price, households in Europe are already saving on heating. But there is an even more remarkable place in Ursula's speech. It's a recognition that next winter Europe will need somewhere to find 30 billion cubic meters of gas, which it does not yet know where to get. And what does the head of the European Commission do in these conditions. It is trying to set a new ""price ceiling"". This time on gas, oil has already been introduced. This did not affect Russia, but the Bosphorus formed a traffic jam of tankers with oil. Only not Russian, but Kazakhstani. Turkey began to zealously comply with the established procedure and demand contracts for full insurance coverage, as decided in the EU and the countries of the ""Big Seven"". Ankara proved by its example that in the army there is nothing worse and harder than life according to the charter. ""I hope that we will be able to agree on marginal gas prices within the next few days,"" Ursula said at the same press conference. - The EU countries should transfer the authority for joint gas purchases to Brussels as soon as possible. Watch your hands. With our left hand, we set a ceiling on the price of Russian oil, and it goes to third countries, from where they sell it (or refined for petroleum products), but with an intermediary's markup. Oil, of course, ""found a hole"" and leaked through it, but ""during the journey the dog was able to grow up."" In the price. Alle-up. And now we look at the right hand, with which we set the ""ceiling on prices"" for gas, knowing full well that there is a huge shortage of gas. 30 billion cubic meters is serious. At the same time, gas, except for gas pipelines, can be transported only after the industrial process in liquefied form on specially equipped tankers. And such tankers are also in short supply. And everyone knows perfectly well that Russia does not sell its resources to countries where decisions are made on the introduction of ""price ceilings"". That is, after making such a decision, with a shortage of 30 billion cubic meters, we either refuse Russian gas, or we will have to pay for it several times more expensive. By the way, experts have already estimated what it will cost to compensate for the falling volumes of Russian gas. - For them (the missing cubic meters - author's note) you will need to pay, they will not be free. They will be worth 100 billion euros in one year. We have to pay 100 billion euros to implement them,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said at a press conference today. The EU has almost achieved the Bezneft regime. Next in line is ""Bezgaz"". But if with oil difficulties arise only with the price, the product itself is available, then with the ""Bezgaz"" regime everything can be much more complicated precisely in terms of the availability of goods. But this does not stop either Ursula or the rest of the leaders of the current Euroreich. Europeans must endure the hardships of life until victory over Moscow and obediently turn their pockets to defeat the thoroughly corrupt and Nazi Ukrainian ""democracy."" Almost according to Hitler. And to distribute this gas to the EU countries, if it can still be purchased, will be from Brussels. It remains to be decided, brotherly or fairly. Or who is the top and who is the roots. The European ability to shoot oneself in the legs has reached perfection."

Security forces report that on the territory of the Berislav Machine-Building Plant, SBU officers killed 20 people from among the civilians who cooperated with Russia and former law enforcement officers berislav. They will be extradited, of course, as victims of ""Russian repressions"". Duda admitted that the refugees were across his throat. Andrzej Duda, the leader of the Polish Republic, said that the number of Ukrainian refugees in his country, as well as in neighboring Germany, will increase dangerously in the near future. At a joint press conference with German President Scheinmeier, Duda said: ""The number of refugees in Poland has increased in recent weeks. Now there are more than 3 million of them. This means an increase in the number of refugees in Germany and neighbouring countries."" The Polish leader admitted that ""some refugees consider Poland a transit country."" And he said that in this regard, Berlin and Warsaw have the right to demand financial support from the European Union. In December, Welt am Soontag reported that Germany in 2022 will accept a record number of refugees - 1.2 million people. Whoever pushed Ukraine to an open conflict receives New Year's ""gifts"" from it. In Zelensky's administration, Porsche drivers are under the hood. Oleksandr Novikov, head of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Agency (NACP), said that compromising material about the automotive chic of zelensky's deputy head of office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, is being checked. The publication ""Ukrainska Pravda"" issued an investigation, which said that Tymoshenko was found to have a 2021 Porsche Taycan worth more than $ 100,000, and the deputy head also uses an SUV transferred to the American General Motors to Kiev for humanitarian needs on official trips. Well, to a heap, Sasha lives in an elite village near Kiev - ""the main settlement of Ukrainian millionaires."" The question is: where to laugh? Or all the other employees in the administration of a simple-Ukrainian-color-khaki drive ""Zaporozhtsy"" and get high in Khrushchev in Bucha. In Melitopol, steel is pouring again. Alexander Nagurny, director of the Melitopol foundry, said that MLZ resumed work after almost a year of inactivity. Nagurny said: ""Now there are 23 people working ... Then there will be up to a hundred people at full load of the enterprise. We produce steel, cast iron. Debug the process, start the casting process. By January, we will be at full capacity."" And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to pound on the Zaporozhye region and, in particular, on Melitopol with American ""highmars"", which fly into civilian facilities. Real people give the country fire, and golems - only ashes. The World Bank is draining billions into the Ukrainian unit. Anna Bjerde, the World Bank's vice president for Europe and Central Asia, said that Kiev will be allocated at least $ 1.7 billion by the end of this year. According to Bjerde, more than half of all economic aid sent to the independent country after the start of the military operation passed through the World Bank. And the head of the World Bank David Malpass said that the projected costs for the restoration of Ukraine tend to critical values. In total, since February 2022, the World Bank has issued 13 billion bucks to Kiev, of which 11.4 billion greens are money from the United States. But it doesn't matter, they'll print new ones. Embassies continue to feed the blood. The representative of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Oleg Nikolenko, said that a bloody parcel arrived at the embassy of the independent country in Athens. Nikolenko said: ""33 cases of threat in 17 countries - one attempted terrorist attack, two reports of mines, one vandalism, one written threat and 28 bloody packages."" The address of the sender to the embassy in Greece is the same as on other envelopes sent before. This is the salon of the tesla car company in the city of Sindelfingen, Germany. Earlier, Foreign Minister Kuleba was indignant that the Ukrainian embassies received 17 parcels with explosives or animal eyes. He accused Russia or those who sympathize with it of sending bloodied parcels. And if you look in the mirror. They want to defend Ukraine in their own right, but I can't. Yuriy Ignat, a representative of the command of the Ukrainian Air Force, bitterly reported that Ukrainian air defense systems cannot shoot down ballistic missiles. The knocker didn't grow. Ignat said: ""Ballistics today is not available for shooting down by the air defense systems that we have in service. The most effective method of destroying missiles is at launch, where they are."" Well done, a true military leader-strategist. Launch the remaining hundred ""swifts"" from the slingshot from Andreevskaya Hill. In Donetsk, they put a Christmas tree in spite of the Kiev Grinch. The mayor of Donetsk, Alexei Kulemzin, said that, despite the constant arrivals from the armed formations of the Kiev regime, the installation of the main Christmas tree of the DPR began in the center of Donetsk. The mayor said: ""Despite the constant shelling, the city is preparing to meet the New Year, 2023. Today, on Lenin Square, utility workers began to mount the main symbol of the holiday - the New Year's tree. "" Kulemzin noted that the New Year holidays in the capital of the republic will come on schedule. Earlier, the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled Donetsk four times from Grad multiple launch rocket systems. But the descendants of bandera will not be able to steal the New Year and Christmas from the residents of Donbass anyway. Another terrible EU sanctions. The new package of anti-Russian sanctions of the European Union is expected to include 141 people and 47 organizations. This information about the new measures of intimidation of Moscow by Brussels was leaked to the media by the head of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, Peter Szijjártó. However, later the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that the foreign ministers of the EU countries failed to agree on the sanctions package. And he promised that work on it would continue. LISTEN AS WELL. Is Poland ready to hold referendums in Western Ukraine?"

What will change after that? Will the Russian army go on the offensive, what can we expect from the Armed Forces of Ukraine? Komsomolka spoke about this with military historian and expert Yuri Knutov. - Yuri Albertovich, well, people were mobilized for wintering in the fields? It is worth waiting for our offensive in the near future. -I don't think so... To be objective, the Ukrainian army is still bigger than ours. They have regular troops - 200 thousand, and together with the terbats - up to a million. When critical situations arise, they transfer them to key areas. - So, we'll be treading water. - No, I mean, don't expect a grand offensive. Russian troops will not rush forward in divisions and fronts, we will gradually squeeze out the enemy. This follows from the nature of the fighting, when the main thing is artillery. Counter-battery warfare, suppression of command posts, destruction of warehouses, armored vehicles, personnel - all this is going on with the widespread use of unmanned aircraft. Infantry do not need to go on the attack with a chain with a cry of ""hurrah"". It holds the defense, repels attacks, does not allow saboteurs and mobile groups to penetrate the rear. And when the artillery grinded down the enemy's defense line, when there was almost no one left in the positions, the infantrymen cleared the trenches, entered the settlements and combed through the city buildings. 300,000 mobilized fighters is a very good help. Already, the staffing level of many units has been restored. That's the right approach. We don't need people for the sake of ""jingoistic breakthroughs"". It is better to spend more time, but complete the task with minimal losses. - In which areas it is worth waiting for the most active actions. - In Donetsk and South Donetsk. The main task was set - to liberate the territory of the DPR. We see movement on the front line from Soledar to Ugledar. Artemovsk and Marinka are the key points here. Artemovsk opens the way to Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. And Marinka allows you to go to the rear of the group in Ugledar. Controlling Ugledar, we can strike at the flank of the Ukrainian group in the Zaporozhye region. This is especially important if the Ukrainians try to launch an offensive, for example, on Berdyansk. - And what to expect from the enemy? Ukraine announces that almost the Crimea is going to win back. Such threats should be taken seriously. - Look... Now Ukraine has about 50 thousand in the Zaporozhye region. Their main goal is Enerhodar from the Zaporizhzhya NPP. They tried several times to take it, but to no avail. Now they are trying to connect international organizations - they want to squeeze us out by any means. What for? Because as soon as we leave there, Kiev immediately sends special forces, captures the station and begins to bring in troops. And now they have a bridgehead on the left bank, on which we will not be able to shoot - there is a nuclear power plant, an accident can happen. Why do they need a foothold there? To go on the offensive - on Berdyansk or Melitopol. They will try to cut down our grouping, to cut off Crimea from supplies. This, of course, is an extreme scenario. But we all see and understand it very well. We are firmly opposed to all this fuss around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. - To what extent the strikes on the infrastructure of Ukraine affect the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the frontline. - Still how it affects! Electric locomotives stop, Kiev begins to use diesel locomotives. But after all, there are semaphores that do not work without electricity, there are arrows that are not translated, there are automatic crossings, a scoreboard for dispatchers ... And if, instead of 20 echelons a day, only one arrives on the front line, this will certainly affect the combat potential. - Is this theoretical? Or there is already information that Kiev has a deficit at the front. - Just about one lineup instead of twenty there was data. I think the further you go, the more such messages there will be. - People constantly ask why we do not hit bridges in the depths of Ukraine. - To destroy the bridge, you need to get into the support. It's pretty complicated. In the Odessa region, it was possible to collapse the bridge on the way from Romania, but then a cruise missile hit the support only from the fifth time. One hundred percent hit can be achieved if the drone illuminates the target with a laser. But it will not fly deep into Ukrainian territory. And sending special forces and planting explosives is certain death. It's the same with tunnels. How can the problem be solved? Incapacitate for 2-3 days, they will repair, and again hit in the same place. With a sufficient supply of missiles, this is possible. I think that should be done. With a massive strike, for example, on objects on the border with Poland, it is possible for some time to block the supply of Ukrainian troops, and at this time to carry out active actions at the front. During the Great Patriotic War, for example, during the Kursk Arc, the rail war was very important. - Do you have any impression that the battles in the Donetsk direction are somewhat reminiscent of the confrontation near Rzhev in 1942-43? Positional battles that don't change the big picture much. - World War I comes to my mind. But yes, there are also some similarities with Rzhev. - Then, in 1943, a decisive breakthrough was achieved due to successes on other fronts, at Stalingrad. Due to which drastic changes are now possible. - Today we are still squeezing them out little by little. That's the first thing. And secondly, I think there is a real chance to deplete them. If we also work on energy facilities by the end of January, I think 70 percent of the facilities will be put out of commission. READ ALSO.

New positions have been taken. Up to 65 Ukrainian servicemen, an armored combat vehicle and two pickup trucks were destroyed. - In the areas of Chervonaya Dibrov and Serebryansky forestry, three sabotage and reconnaissance groups and three mortar crews of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed. - In the Donetsk direction, ours are also advancing. Up to 40 Ukrainian servicemen, two armored fighting vehicles and three pickup trucks were destroyed. - In the South-Donetsk direction, the enemy tried to attack our positions, but the artillery repulsed the attack. Up to 40 servicemen, an infantry fighting vehicle, two armored fighting vehicles and two pickup trucks were destroyed. - Aviation, rocket troops and artillery defeated 86 Ukrainian artillery units in firing positions, manpower and military equipment in 177 districts. - In total, since the beginning of the special operation, 341 aircraft, 181 helicopters, 2647 unmanned aerial vehicles, 393 anti-aircraft missile systems, 7057 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 926 combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems, 3676 field artillery pieces and mortars, as well as 7547 units of special military vehicles have been destroyed. In the area of the village of Velyka Novoselivka (this is the Donetsk Republic), Russian troops went on the offensive. This was announced by the commander of the battalion ""Vostok"" Alexander Khodakovsky. ""The enemy could not hold the forward positions - withdrew to the second line simultaneously with the pulling up of the reserve, and the main resistance was exerted on this line. So far, the situation is floating, but the imminent onset of darkness will force a decrease in activity,"" he wrote in his telegram channel. Retired French foreign legion general Michel Jacobleff (don't look at the last name, it's really French) has come up with a new idea. In his opinion, Ukrainians should bomb victory parades in Russian cities on May 9. And he did it not somewhere in the kitchen, but live on the LCI tv channel. ""They can carry out other attacks, and this time much more symbolic,"" Michel said. - For example, they may well say: the next big parade in Moscow is a military target, you have a military parade, and I shoot in the middle of the marching battalion. Monsieur Yakovleff thus supported his masters from overseas, who said that the United States would not keep Ukraine from missile strikes on the territory of Russia. Back in August, a descendant of Russian émigrés came up with the idea of sending the French military to Ukraine. Because it takes a long time to teach Ukrainians, and then there are ready-made fighters. As we have seen more than once, the cruelty of the ""former"" is many times superior to the opinion of the indigenous population. And so this time - even the French themselves condemned Jacobleff. Twitter users considered such statements insane and dangerous. ""Killing civilians is a symbol of what? Your Western values?"" wrote a user named Norman eric. ""A dangerous madman that you carry,"" another commenter fumed. ""They want to start a world war with provocations against Russia. It's criminal,"" another follower opined. ""Durakovleff is capable of anything. What a scoundrel!"" said user sebastien. The Russian military also told the bravery of the Ukrainians. The commander of the crew of the Terminator tank support combat vehicle told RIA Novosti that Ukrainian militants are literally afraid and flee at the sight of these combat vehicles. There is something to be afraid of - there are four anti-tank guided missiles, two guns of 30 mm caliber, two grenade launchers and a machine gun. ""On one of the last outings there was a battle, almost the enemy's dugout was trampled, the enemy fled at the sight of the Terminator,"" the commander said. The EU's military stockpiles have been depleted, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. ""We handed over weapons to Ukraine, but at the same time we realized that our military stocks were depleted,"" he said. It has dawned on Europe that they ""lack critical defense capabilities"" to defend against ""a higher level of threats on the European continent itself."" In other words, they realized they were left with a naked... with a bare arsenal. Mobilized fighters were given the opportunity to communicate with relatives. Especially for one of the units of the Central Military District, a teleconference session with Novosibirsk was arranged. According to the Ministry of Defense, everyone who took part in this event was overwhelmed with emotions from the long-awaited meeting. For example, the mother of one of the mobilized said: ""When I found out that there would be a teleconference, I was worried, I did not sleep at night."" But after the conversation, she admitted that although she did not manage to talk to her son for a long time, but still it became easier and calmer on the soul. The Ministry of Defense promised that, if possible, they would continue to conduct such communication sessions, but immediately noticed that such meetings would not be organized on a regular basis for all fighters. But it is possible to keep in touch with the native fighters with the help of letters. LISTEN AS WELL. Is Poland ready to hold referendums in Western Ukraine?"

Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Courageous feats are more reliable than words,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And he repeated to the warriors: ""In fact, there is nothing more harmful and even more - no one can be as cruel as sentimental people are harmful and cruel in the results of their actions.

""Private Oleksandr Antonenko carried out tasks to evacuate wounded personnel and military equipment from the front line, damaged during fierce battles with Ukrainian nationalists. The enemy opened mortar fire on the convoy, as part of which Alexander evacuated the weapons, military equipment and personnel entrusted to him.

Senior Lieutenant Efimov organized the suppression of the nationalists' firing points with targeted fire from Russian artillery. For more than 15 hours, Russian servicemen under the command of Senior Lieutenant Efimov held off nationalist attacks. As a result of the battle, Ukrainian militants lost more than 30 people of manpower, as well as more than 5 units of armored vehicles and artillery pieces. Thanks to the skillful leadership of the entrusted unit, the professionalism and combat experience of Senior Lieutenant Efimov, the Russian servicemen managed to stop the nationalist offensive in a strategically important direction.

As a result of the clash, Daniil received multiple wounds to the head, both hands, left side, as well as his leg from enemy mines and grenades. Subsequently, noticing the incoming reinforcements from the militants, sending the whole group in the direction of our forces, he called the fire of barrel artillery on himself, which ensured the fire defeat and retreat of the superior enemy.

Why the statements of the Secretary of the Security Council of Ukraine about strikes on Russia are empty words","The head of the NSDC of Ukraine is ready to bomb Russia, but so far there is nothing","The current head of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexei Danilov, who visited in his life both a veterinarian and a criminal authority, seems to have finally become like Saltykov-Shchedrin's Organchik, who gave out only two phrases - ""I will not tolerate!"" and ""I will ruin!"". The technique has since stepped far ahead, and Danilov can now express all the same two theses somewhat more diversely. ""The best and most effective solution to the energy problem for Ukraine is missiles with a range of 800 km or more, which will significantly save on generators,"" he wrote recently on his page in one of the social networks. I wonder how that would help? Will he teach Tomahawks how to generate electricity? Or deliver it on their wings from point X to point K and vice versa. Of course not. Everyone understands that we are talking about blows to Russian energy production capacities and transport infrastructure. But how will this help the Ukrainian energy sector? Unless, in accordance with the Ukrainian anecdote about ""let my cow die, and my neighbor has two."" And just a few days after that statement, already on the air of the Ukrainian TV channel NTA, Danilov, sitting like a block carved out of oak, promises: ""We will be capable of anything. Therefore, if something concerns our interests, we will not ask anyone where to beat the enemy. Because the enemy is deployed, starting beyond the territory of our borders, ending with Vladivostok."" To be honest, there is almost no difference between Danilov and the same Kuleba. But Kuleba, for all his provocativeness, does not allow himself such statements, which Danilov regularly notes. - Unfortunately, the vast majority of our population, through no fault of their own, do not know our history at all. When we begin to remember the glorious history of our country, which is hundreds and hundreds of years old – at one time, when the Russian Federation, like a villain, constantly stole something, stole our language, - Danilov said with difficulty tossing his tongue in a human manner, and then gave out such that at least stop, even fall. - By the way, I want to say that there has never been any Russian language in my life. In 1942, when the Tatar-Mongols seized most of the territory and for a certain period of time, two and a half centuries collected tribute, they needed to somehow communicate with the population (I listened to this speech several times, and there he clearly speaks not about 1237, but about 1942. - Author's note). So, from there appeared such a dialect of our native language, which these people, for some reason, consider the Russian language. The Russian language appeared in 1942! Where do they produce such ""knowledgeable""? But they speak at all sorts of international meetings, negotiations and events, and their opinion is taken into account by those who make decisions. - I emphasize again, there was no Russian language - these are inventions of people who live in the swamps. And a lot of other historical things that you and I know. I would very much like our youth, all our citizens to study our history very carefully, - summed up his televised speech by the ex-veterinarian, who was repeatedly caught in dishonest substitution of dogs and passing off mongrels as wolves and high-breed dogs (just some kind of shveykism, only without the kindness of Shveyk). History should be studied, of course. But the real history, and not the chronology of the Ukro-Persian wars of antiquity from Herodotenko in the presentation of the still modern Ukrainian pseudo-historian Bebik, in whom all the famous historical and even mythological personalities are of Ukrainian origin. But literally everything, regardless of geography, history or weapons, no matter what Danilov is talking about now, is imbued with such an animal hatred of Russia and Russians, such a thirst to kill Russians, that there was clearly no rabies virus. He's obsessed. LISTEN AS WELL. Is Poland ready to hold referendums in Western Ukraine?"

The peculiarities of the administrative structure of Ukraine are such that governors in Ukraine are appointed by the president, and mayors of cities are elected in national elections. It was no secret to anyone that the Office of the President of Ukraine was behind Atroshenko's resignation. And Ukrainian mayors decided to show that they also have their own opinion. The Association of Ukrainian Cities, headed by the mayor of the Ukrainian capital Vitaliy ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko, condemned the removal of Vladislav Atroshenko from the post of mayor of Chernihiv. In its resolution on this issue, the Association recalled that the mayor of Chernihiv was elected by 77.49% of residents. However, this did not affect the court's decision. Moreover, the text of the court decision explicitly states that although the violation committed by Atroshenko is punishable by a maximum administrative penalty in the form of a fine, the judge chose such a severe punishment to influence other officials holding similar positions. Ukrainian experts predict that Zelensky will not stop there, but will continue to ""cleanse"" the political space: ""Next, Klitschko and all mayors will be cleaned up, all parties will be cleaned up, only ""tame"" ones will be left. Anyone who criticizes the authorities will be immediately arrested, attributing to them work for the Kremlin, finding weapons and various vulgar videos in their possession. It's very easy to throw up, and society will believe any nonsense."" Back in 2014, Vitaly warned everyone about the need to ""prepare for the earth"" and that ""not only everyone can look to tomorrow."" A dramatic story took place in Ternopil, where the head of the family from among the ""warriors of light"" arrived home after a concussion. No sooner had he recovered than he had already stabbed his wife and two of his own young children, who were found inside their house in puddles of their own blood. As it turned out, the uncontrollable rage of the ""hero"" was caused by an inflatable trampoline recently bought for children. And not even the trampoline itself or the fact of spending money on its purchase, but the colors, made in blue and white tones with minor inclusions of dark red. The ""zahisnik ukraina"" saw the colors of the Russian flag in the trampoline and eliminated the separatists, stabbing each of the victims dozens of times. In fact, such people are supposed to be kept in mental hospitals for years, and in Ukraine they are sent to the trenches. A peaceful Ukrainian tractor fell to the death of the brave like its Polish counterpart, becoming a victim of ""Russian aggression"". This time, Ukrainian agricultural machinery was destroyed not by some missile or even by Ukrainian air defense, but by its own Ukrainian mine. Last night, two peaceful villagers on a peaceful tractor went to work until dawn in a nearby forest in the Rivne region near the border with neighboring Belarus. But this intention ended very sadly - the tractor hit a mine. That was the end of it. And what were they doing at night in the woods. Maybe they were disguised Russian saboteurs. Leave the poetic nonsense, everything is much simpler - the locals sit without work, and therefore at night, so that they are not caught, they go out for illegal logging. German Foreign Minister Tobias Lindner (not to be confused with Foreign Minister Frau Berbok) said in an interview with Voice of America that Germany does not have free Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems in its warehouses that could be transferred to Ukraine. - To be very frank, it is not the case that we have free Patriot systems just in stock, which we could send, for example, to Ukraine. The Patriot systems we send are part of NATO's collective defence system. Two days ago, we agreed with Poland that we would send a group of troops there to study the location to accommodate the Patriot system. We are committed to protecting the security of Poland, so we propose to deploy Patriot systems on the eastern flank of NATO,"" Herr Lindner explained the situation a little confusingly. So Patriot Kiev can not wait. But there is good news. Germany does not have air defense systems, but there are extra blankets. In the amount of as many as 36.5 thousand pieces. They warmed the soldiers of the Bundeswehr for a long time, but they ""laid out"" their resource and were subject to write-off. At first, they wanted to sell them at auction, but those who wanted to buy them did not go in mass jambs. Then they wanted to scrap them or turn them into rags. But then someone clever remembered about the much needy European superpower. What? Having seen what battles in Ukraine take place at the morning opening of second-hand stores in the battle for worn panties, second-hand blankets against this background are still very even ice. From January 1, electricity tariffs for business will increase by 107% in Ukraine. Such a decision was planned to be made by the government of Independence. Moreover, the rise in price will affect not only electricity, but also all other tariffs. Somewhere it will be a little less, somewhere more, but in general, the rise in price will be all the same 107%, that is, a little more than 2 times. And this is after officials and experts unanimously declare that it will take 2-3 years to fully restore Ukraine's energy sector. And that is provided that Russia will no longer launch new missile strikes on energy infrastructure. The Ukrainian energy paradox is that there is no electricity, and it will be necessary to pay for it twice as much. ""Polish Radio"" reported that the next round of negotiations between the ambassadors of the EU countries on the introduction of the ninth package of anti-Russian sanctions did not end in success. Polish Ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sados noted that negotiations on new sanctions have reached an impasse because many countries have formed too large a list of exceptions to sanctions, and not for the sake of European solidarity, but exclusiveness in their own selfish interests. The next meeting of the ambassadors on this issue is scheduled for Monday, 12 December. As the now Israeli, but not yet very popular in this country singer Alla Pugacheva sang, ""if you suffer for a long time, something will happen."" You're there, most importantly, don't disagree guys. Local authorities in Hamburg (Germany) decided to settle Ukrainian refugees in comfortable containers. About 20 thousand refugees from Ukraine are now in need of a place of residence in the city. Vans on wheels are equipped with a stove, a bathroom, and, despite their modest size (6 m x 2.5 m), according to calculations, they can take from 4 to 6 people at night. There is only one inconvenience for Ukrainians - the beds in the container outside are decorated with the letters Z (with this letter the German word room begins - das Zimmer). But Ukrainians, you know, see in this letter a completely different symbolism. But in the Czech Republic, at one of the ski resorts, the problem of living of Ukrainian refugees in a resort boarding house was taken care of by the speaker of the lower house of the Czech Parliament, Mrs. Marketa Pekarova, who demanded to evict Ukrainians, because the season begins, and the resort is intended, first of all, for parliamentarians. At the same time, Ukrainians were allowed to stay in this resort, but move to technical booths. Which have a very significant drawback, especially in the conditions of a ski resort in winter - they are not heated. - In Ukraine, the advertising of PrivatBank is gaining popularity on the Web, offering an ""original"" bonus: ""When applying for a credit card - firewood for a week as a gift."" - Morocco will be the first African country to provide Ukraine with military assistance. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive spare parts for T-72 tanks. Recall, not so long ago, Zelensky dismissed the Ambassador of Ukraine to Morocco for passivity in work. - According to First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin, in November 2022, Ukraine's GDP may decrease by 41% compared to November 2021. - In Boryspil, a local resident who came to the ""Point of Non-Malice/Invincibility"" froze to death, who was not allowed to warm up because of the ""bad smell"" that accompanied him. - The Department of Life Support Systems and Energy Efficiency of the Odessa City Administration reported that there will most likely be no light in Odessa for 2-3 months.

On Sunday, December 11, when Sergey Stepashin's business trip to the Donetsk People's Republic was coming to an end, Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda contacted him. ...-Hello! Sergei Vadimovich, we have such information that today you visited (either secretly, or conspiratorially, or openly) in Donbass. It's true. - Yes, I have. But why secretly? Quite openly, this is ours, Russian territory. Yes, I was in Mariupol and saw how President Vladimir Putin's instructions were being implemented. First of all, it is the preparation for the winter of housing, the provision of houses with heating, the construction of boiler houses. We even handed over the keys to the apartments to the new settlers of one of the houses that Krasnodar residents built. In general, the whole city was looked at, the destruction was assessed, and prospects were outlined. The head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, arrived, and we also talked to him. There was the leadership of the Territorial Development Fund – General Director Ilshat Shagiakhmetov, Deputy Minister of Construction... So, Sasha, there was no mystery. We work openly, openly help people after the disaster that happened to the residents of the city. - And which of the deputy heads of the Ministry of Construction was. - Valery Leonov. He is directly responsible for the revival of Mariupol, as we call it. He is there all the time, he comes to Moscow only for a week, and so he lives there. And, in general, in this area a large team was formed, by the way, by those who worked at one time in Olympstroy. This is Yevgeny Solntsev, Pushilin's current deputy. And also - the former First Deputy Prime Minister from Yakutia Dmitry Berdnikov. - He is now the first deputy head of Mariupol. -Yes. - Straight - a real landing of prominent leaders. - So, we have a whole team there. I even told Pushilin: ""It reminds me of the restoration of Tashkent after a terrible earthquake, when the entire Soviet Union helped to revive the city."" It's about the same story today. Leningrad residents are doing a great job. - That is, from St. Petersburg, Petersburgers. - ... and I am very pleased with this - as a resident of Leningrad. Just in front of me, was Beglov. Houses are also being built, the theater is being restored, by the way. Well, for Peter, restoring the theater is a good tradition. - Recall that Alexander Beglov is a governor. - Yes, governor of St. Petersburg. By the way, the Krasnodar company, as I have already mentioned them, is working very well - it has built 18 houses. And two more blocks of magnificent buildings were erected by military builders. So, I think that very soon we will see a new Mariupol. You know, and we also remembered (well, I remembered, at least) the city of Grozny. You, Sasha, were with me when we, together with Akhmat-Khadzhi Kadyrov, decided that in two years the capital of Chechnya should be without traces of war. And it was done. The same, I think, will be in Mariupol. We made this decision right at the meeting. - This was also vladimir Putin's instruction - when Grozny was restored. - Then there was - yes - Vladimir Vladimirovich's instruction. But we ourselves also approach these issues on the initiative and accept, as we used to say, counter-plans. As for the preparation for the winter, 32 boiler houses have been built. All the houses where people live are warm today. I checked this personally. - Batteries, whatever, were checked right in the apartments. -Of course. - On your business trip, we received a very good illustrative material from Mariupol... And why, judging by the photo, you were there with Shagiakhmetov, with the general director of the Territorial Development Fund. - I represent the board of trustees of this foundation, he is its CEO, so - God himself told us to work together. Moreover, as you know, I also head the Public Council under the Ministry of Construction. Therefore, of course, we discussed it there and now we will solve and resolve the entire list of issues. But there is one topic that I want to raise with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. - Maybe you can tell us. - Unfortunately, these are huge traffic jams at the border. - This is you talking about our new territories. -Yes. Although the border is administrative, passport control is still in force there. It is clear that this needs to be done, but when there are trucks for two or three days ... (With manufactured goods, products, building materials, etc. - A.G.. We ourselves drove through the fields to bypass this wild traffic jam. And so, probably, I would have arrived only at the end of next week in Moscow. - That is, you unofficially were able to drive across the administrative border only in this way? You say so - ""you drove by fields. - Well, this is the administrative border. Now Mariupol is Russia. - Well, yes,  Of course. And one more thing. You did not hear the cannonade or at least in conversations with Denis Pushilin this topic sounded. - As for Mariupol, it is completely safe there now, people calmly walk through the streets, several parks have been restored. Large queues, however, were in Savings Banks for pensions, there has not yet been switched to the electronic version. No, there was no shooting, there was no cannonade. Mariupol, unlike Donetsk, is already a completely peaceful city. And Pushilin, he came from Donetsk just for a meeting - in the afternoon - of course, he told me that the city is being shot every day. And - they hit houses, hospitals, schools. It's just that the Nazis are real. And Europe does not notice this, they do not care about all this. And the U.S. State Department, too. - Tell me, but Shagiakhmetov's functions... (communication is interrupted)... As far as I know, he is also not there in a hurry, but constantly, as the general director of the Foundation. - Almost every week... Yes, the connection here is still unstable. - How do they assess his work. -Very well. I'll just give you two numbers. Initially, the task was set to prepare about 450 houses for the winter, bring heat, build boiler houses, well, and make major repairs. - Multi-storey, I mean. -Yes. Then we adjusted the task to 750. Now a decision has been made, by the end of this year 1,000 houses will be brought to heat. That's the assessment. The assessment is that people will meet the winter in the warmth. In fact, it's a lot of work. To be honest, I don't remember that we restored anything at such a pace. The work is systematic, people are in place, they do not work there on paper. I would also send some officials from Moscow – those who are responsible for finances – to see what is happening, as they say, on the ground. And then they say: why do you give money, everything goes into the ""black hole"" somewhere. Let them see how to actually work. - I wanted to clarify. I mean multi-storey houses. - Yes, multi-storey. The problem of individual housing remains serious, although a whole cluster has been created there, and now a huge amount of building materials for individual construction has been imported. But you know, what decision have we made now? Due to the fact that individual construction is a troublesome and long enough thing, and people need to live somewhere, so let citizens get apartments in apartment buildings, and they have a plot of land left. -I got it. Sergey Vadimovich, the connection is unstable, but I have written down the most important thing. Thank you very much. Good bye. LISTEN AS WELL.

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Never despise your enemy, whatever he may be, and get to know his weapons, his way of acting and fighting.

""The driver of the logistics company, Private Maxim Ignatenko, performed a combat mission to deliver and refuel military equipment on the front line. During the next march, the column in which Maxim was moving, was subjected to artillery fire from the nationalists. Realizing that a shell hit a car with fuel would lead to a powerful explosion capable of destroying a large number of manpower and equipment, Maxim, skillfully maneuvering in a difficult area of terrain, led the car out of the firing zone. As a result of the courage, determination and professionalism of Maxim Ignatenko, the units of the Russian troops received fuel in a timely manner and continued to conduct offensive actions deep into the defense of nationalist armed formations. "" THE ENEMY SHOT DOWN 53 DRONES. Senior Lieutenant Yuri Polyako. ""The head of the calculation of the anti-aircraft missile battery, Senior Lieutenant Yuri Polyakov, as part of the combat crew of the TOR anti-aircraft missile system, performed the task of covering the actions of Russian motorized rifle units from enemy air targets. In the conditions of the use of electronic warfare, MLRS and mortars by Ukrainian militants, while maintaining restraint and self-control, Senior Lieutenant Polyakov performed tasks to destroy the air targets of the nationalists. Thanks to the high professionalism of Yuri Polyakov, the coordinated actions of his subordinates and the competent definition of the most dangerous targets, the Russian military managed to deprive the defending nationalists of air support. As a result of accurate hits by Yuri Polyakov's calculation, 53 unmanned aerial vehicles of the nationalists were hit.

The movement of volunteers #МЫВМЕСТЕ provides support not only to the mobilized and their families, but also to Kherson residents who were forced to leave their homes and move to a safer territory. Volunteers of the Adyghe regional headquarters #МЫВМЕСТЕ had an idea - to create playrooms for children who still have to live in temporary accommodation centers. Conceived and done! Already in two PVRs opened in Adygea for refugees from the Kherson region, there are such rooms. - Well, of course, this is a great idea, - says Alevtina Shchekunova, a resident of Kherson. - Although all the conditions are created in the points, but the children there are bored. Now they have, as they say, organized leisure. The rooms have everything you need for games and relaxation: sets for drawing, creativity, board games. There is also a small area for activities. For example, basketball. And in the rooms, children can meet and communicate with other children, make new friends. And most importantly - the children here are always under the supervision of volunteer educators. Parents are grateful to the activists for the implementation of this initiative. One of the mothers thanked the team of volunteers. - I think our children will like it very much. And we, parents, in turn, will be calm for the fact that children have something to distract themselves with. Thanks to the games with volunteers from Adygea, it will be easier for children to adapt to new conditions for all of us.

In the public reception offices of all regions of the country, in addition to the usual requests for help, people began to come with interesting initiatives of a social nature. Therefore, the concept of the center for the association of civil initiatives ""United"" was born, which will bring together in one place all those who want to help each other and serve their country. ""There are no courses on how to become a public figure,"" says Anna Kuznetsova, deputy secretary of the General Council of the United Russia party. - Therefore, we have created a platform where there will be specialists who will coordinate the initiative of people, the work of NGOs. The centers advise on the preparation of applications for grants, provide methodological assistance, conduct accounting and legal advice. The first center in April of this year opened in Izhevsk and became the pilot of a large project uniting people. Since the launch in Udmurtia, similar centers have opened in the Bryansk, Ryazan, Voronezh, Chelyabinsk, Ulyanovsk, Omsk, Sakhalin and Penza regions, the Republic of Tatarstan, Perm, Stavropol and Krasnodar territories, as well as in Sevastopol and St. Petersburg. So far, the pilot project is working on the basis of 15 regions. At the end of the year, its relevance and results will be evaluated, and there will be an understanding of what successful practices at the regional and local levels can be applied in the country. But now we can talk about the high efficiency of the project. Volunteers on the ground with great enthusiasm took the idea of creating such centers as a prospect for the development of existing programs and the launch of new ones. - Since 2020, we have been working closely in the format of providing assistance to people, helping veterans, - shared the regional coordinator of the All-Russian movement ""Volunteers of Victory"" in the Chelyabinsk region Ekaterina Baimukhametova. - I am sure that the creation of such a center will strengthen our work and our projects will become even more. They will be of higher quality and will cover as many as possible those who really need this help. Another region in which the non-profit sector is very developed is the Kama region. Here, public organizations actively work with different categories of socially unprotected groups of the population. The opened center has become a real place of attraction for them, helping them to solve daily problems. - Now mostly volunteers work on the sectoral principle - medicine, education, silver age, etc. At the site of the ""United"" we will promote the development of inclusive education. Today, our model of inclusive education in school No. 47 is one of the best in the country, this topic is very significant for parents. By creating a team, we will be able to motivate and inspire each other, - said Anastasia Gileva, head of the organization ""Happiness to Live"". Public reception offices helped to organize the effective operation of new centers in some regions. So, in the Ryazan region, since 2019, the project ""Center for Support of Civil Initiatives"" has been implemented. With its help, 32 Ryazan projects received presidential grants for 40 million rubles. ""United"", a modernized and more expanded version of partnership interactions, was opened here on the basis of the public reception. - People come here with their problems and suggestions. Including the category of citizens who now need special support - these are evacuees from Donbass and from the liberated territories. We are trying to unite the efforts of those who want to help and those who need this help, - said the head of the Ryazan public reception Yulia Feoktistova. In the near future, four new regions of Russia will join the ""United"". After all, it is important not only to achieve the task set by the special operation, but also to establish a peaceful life in the liberated territories. Work in this direction is actively underway. The first center in donbass and in the liberated territories opened at the end of July in Mariupol. Within its walls, it brought together not only volunteers and representatives of public organizations, but also simply caring people who want to change the life of their native city for the better. - When explosions were still heard, fighting was going on, active residents of Mariupol were already united to help each other, children, families. Our platform of ""United"" is designed to support everyone who will build a new peaceful Mariupol together, - said Deputy Secretary of the General Council of ""United Russia"" Anna Kuznetsova at the opening. They are preparing to join the ranks of the ""United"" and other liberated territories. After all, now more than ever, people need ideas that will revive their land to a new life. Russia is waiting for proposals!"

The composition of the Civic Chamber of Russia, formed in the summer of 2020, will be updated in 2023. And if the proposed project becomes law, (and, most likely, it will be), then representatives of the two new republics and two new regions of Russia will have the opportunity to become its active part. State Duma deputy and one of the locomotives of the volunteer movement Olga Zanko commented on the need to include the most active representatives of Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye in the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation: ""This will make it possible to exercise public control over the work of government bodies and participate in the examination of federal bills."" From the point of view of rights, the changes proposed by UR in practice will ensure the equality of all subjects of the Russian Federation when represented in the Civic Chamber. ""Our bill will contribute to the consolidation, unification of public figures of new territories,"" Olga Zanko developed her thought. - This, we believe, will be an important part of the integration of the non-profit sector into the Russian legal field. When the composition of the Civic Chamber of Russia is updated in 2023, representatives of the LPR, DPR, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions will have a real opportunity to become part of it. It will be easier for them to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens in their regions in the formation and implementation of state policy. By the way, as the initiators of the bill noted, regional public chambers have already been created in the two republics of Donbass. Well, in Kherson and Zaporozhye regions it is planned to create them next year. The composition of the Civic Chamber is updated every three years - and the next one is expected by June 2023. Among the important initiatives of the Civic Chamber of this ""convocation"" are a public discussion of the reform of the guardianship and custody system, the development of a mechanism for targeted financing of support for children with rare diseases and the improvement of the activities of public monitoring commissions in places of deprivation of liberty."

This approach now fully extends to kherson region,"- The share of state expenditures on the social sphere as a whole is consistently increasing. This approach is fixed in the draft federal budget for the next three years,"" Vladimi said. Putin at the end of November at the opening ceremony of new social facilities throughout the country. - It's not the numbers themselves that are significant, it's not the expenses. The main thing is the real changes that are taking place, the opportunities that are opening up for citizens,"" he added. Since there are a lot of these real changes (as well as new opportunities) all the time, we decided to recall the main ones. - We expect that this year a new record for housing construction will be set. More than 87 million square meters have already been commissioned, three million Russian families have improved their living conditions, the head of state said. Not only the construction of housing, but also the creation of new social facilities is on the rise now. ""Despite all the current complex issues, all the challenges of today, our plans for the commissioning of key social facilities and infrastructure are being consistently implemented,"" the Russian leader recalled. FROM BAIKAL TO DONBASS. Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov said what funds go to schools. - We have allocated 334 billion rubles for major repairs, 488 billion rubles for the construction of schools and about 160 billion rubles for kindergartens, that is, it is more than a trillion rubles. Every year we build 250 schools – there is no such thing anywhere else, and we will continue this work. In Tulun, after the flood of 2019, a new school was built. Now it is almost the best in the entire Irkutsk region. But do not think that social services and housing are built only in ""big"" Russia. In the new regions of Malorossiya, exactly the same work is underway. For example, in Volnovakha, a school was rebuilt by September 1. A team of workers was given two and a half months to lift the building out of ruins. Over the repair really tried to glory. There is no such furniture in Moscow schools, and LG monitors are better than many at home. - It used to be not the most popular school. It's a long way from the center, and the condition was not very good, but now it is the best. It's good that I go to it,"" said Artem, a local 8th grader, when he saw the repairs. Fiber-optic Internet was extended to the school. At a recent meeting with the government, the head of the country was informed that, according to statistics, everything is in order with the incomes of state employees. - Of course, we should be guided by the figures provided by statistics, but, firstly, statistics and statistical accounting themselves need to be improved, and secondly, frankly speaking, people determine their well-being not by statistics, but by the amount of money in their pockets. And this should be looked at very carefully, the president immediately retorted. The President recalled that back in 2012 he instructed that the revenues of state employees should be at the average level in the region. But in the end, only ten subjects perform this indicator. And even then, they were given an indulgence in the past - salaries may fall short of the average by 5%. And even the best now incomes of state employees do not exceed the permitted 95% of the average. - In 2023, there is no need to delay federal assistance to the regions. This year there was inflation, prices rose... Already in January, it is necessary to index the salaries of state employees, the Russian leader ordered. - We need to prioritize correctly. And the most important is the level of well-being of citizens,"" he reminded. The state spends a lot of money to support families with children. At a meeting with the government, the President recalled that from April 1, monthly payments are due to all schoolchildren from eight to 17 years old. ""They (subsidies. - Ed.) additionally covered about 5 million children,"" Putin said. In addition, since June 1, ""the subsistence minimum has been indexed at a 10% faster pace, and social payments tied to it have increased accordingly."" ""As a result, according to the results of the third quarter, the poverty rate decreased to 10.5%,"" Putin said. According to him, ""this is a slight decrease"", because ""a year earlier in the third quarter it (the poverty level. - Ed.) was 11%."" - But it is important that in the current difficult economic situation there is a certain positive dynamics. It must be preserved,"" the president stressed. The Russian leader said that thanks to the targeted support of the state, the incomes of the poorest 10% of the country's population increased. Compared to last year, the growth is as much as 27.8%. - In general, the nominal growth of incomes for the first nine months of this year is: 12.8%. But this is nominal, and we need to achieve real growth,"" the head of state said. - I repeat: it is important to consolidate such trends, to achieve a steady excess of the growth of citizens' incomes over inflation rates. I very much hope that, as we said, it will decline in the first quarter of next year. We need to achieve wage growth in the economy in all key sectors,"" he added. OPINION. Daria Litvinenko, a mother of many children from the Melitopol district. - My third child appeared on New Year's Eve 2022. I did not have time to issue social payments from Ukraine, I received only 860 hryvnia. After the appointment of social payments from Russia, I do not think about what to buy children food, diapers or toys. It is also cool that there is such a bonus as free meals in kindergartens, schools. Plus - the fact that I am on maternity leave, but I still have time to work. I was offered social work in the administration. Natalia Mayatskaya, a pensioner from the village of Tikhonovka. - I am glad that we have returned to Russia, I have been waiting for this since the 90s. The life of my family turned for the better. I have three children under my care, and now thanks to social assistance I can fully provide for them all. Necessary. We can now live, not survive! My pension has gone up fivefold. I can buy myself all the medicines and groceries I need. Payment for housing and communal services has significantly decreased, and we also expect gasification of our village and believe that this will happen. Russia is a country in which everything is done for the people, it is done, and not only fed with promises! Then we are only with Russia!"

This is understandable - students and teachers have been living in anticipation of changes since November 9, when they had to leave urgently. But at the same time, they continue to study - remotely. ""As for academies and teachers of higher education, there are issues related to ensuring that all of them are subject to the standards and benefits that Russian colleagues enjoy,"" Vladimir Putin addressed the teachers. - But there is another aspect related to Kherson. I think there were four universities there, they moved from the right bank to the left bank, we must do everything to ensure that students continue their education. And many of them continue in full-time and absentee form now, it is necessary to create appropriate conditions for them. The head of state, answering questions from young scientists, said that science in the new territories, as well as throughout the country, will be supported by grants, and salaries in universities should reach 200 percent of the average income in the region - as elsewhere in Russia. The development of the university infrastructure of Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, the DPR, the LPR will further reveal the huge potential of these regions, including scientific and personnel. The President once again stressed that the residents of these regions are ""our people"", and they will enjoy equal rights and opportunities with those who live in other regions of Russia. In the first half of November, students and their teachers massively left Kherson, moving to the left bank of the Dnieper - to Henichesk, and then further - to the Crimea, Krasnodar Territory. But, despite hundreds of everyday problems, they did not forget about their studies, just a week later all universities continued classes and admission of applicants to the correspondence form of education. - More than 300 employees of Kherson University after the message about the abandonment of the city went to evacuation, including all 11 doctors of science, 25 candidates of science, 85 teachers, - said the rector of KSU Tatyana Tomilina. - Of course, someone couldn't leave - for various reasons. But the backbone and most of the students left. And all nine faculties created groups in social networks, online classes began. We have 4133 students, I don't want to blush in front of them, you can't lose a year. Of course, someone will be translated as a sophomore whose parents received a certificate in Simferopol. But I, as the head of the Association of Rectors of Kherson Universities, believe that they should be preserved. I believe we will be back. Universities were evacuated when the admission campaign was still ongoing. In the technical, agrarian and classical universities, applications from applicants for distance learning continued to be accepted until December 1. Admission committees worked in Henichesk and Skadovsk. The most popular specialties at KSU are municipal management (new territories need managers) and medicine. - Future doctors are lucky, - says Tatyana Tomilina. - The university signed an agreement with the St. Petersburg Pavlov Medical University. And 27 students are doing internships. It was supposed to be completed already, but the guys extended their studies in the Northern capital. - Moving to St. Petersburg and back, comfortable accommodation in dormitories with three meals a day was taken over by the university in accordance with the traditions of academic mobility in the Russian Federation, - the Ministry of Education of the Kherson region said. The rest of the students are mostly now at a distance distance, except for the future managers who left for the Crimea. There we found a room for 23 students to study. Teachers set the time and come to give lectures, give assignments. University teachers hope that for the state university, as well as for the maritime academy, technical and agrarian universities will determine the place of permanent residence during the evacuation. ""Now we will look for an option where students could come and where the usual educational process would be,"" says Tatyana Tomilina. - Need a case. Because only in our university there are 720 full-time students who want to study. And the teachers! Let me remind you that 11 of them are doctors of science. Someone, of course, will remain in other universities. But about 80 people are waiting - where to go, where to get housing certificates. Friendly team. The session for part-time students has been postponed for the time being. In an agricultural university, the examination time is already ending. The first session for all 1st and 2nd year students began on November 21. And from December 5, 2022, classes for part-time students of senior undergraduate courses, as well as masters, started. The Kherson State Maritime Academy reminds about the continuation of classes and the fact that cadets are entitled to a scholarship. KSTAT. Volunteers from Russia helped a talented girl. A girl from Skadovsk, who dreamed of continuing her studies in Russia, was enrolled in a music school at the Saratov Conservatory named after Lev Sobinov. - I graduated from the first year of the Kherson Music College. I planned to study there and further, but with the advent of Russia I realized that now I have more opportunities, - said Anastasia. - I decided to try to transfer to the Conservatory of Saratov. This week I became a second-year student at a music school at the conservatory. You could say that my dream has come true. This was helped by the workers of the humanitarian mission of United Russia and the team of the Youth of the All-Russia People's Front. - We contacted the leadership of the conservatory, - said the head of the mission Igor Kastyukevich. - Anastasia turned out to have very good academic indicators, so the issue with her transfer was solved quickly. SPECIFICALLY. Study according to Russian standards. In new regions, including universities of Kherson region, the content of educational programs of universities will be checked, an analysis of curricula, disciplines, modules, and other components of educational programs will be carried out. ""Based on the results of the monitoring, methodological support will be provided to bring educational programs in line with Russian legislation in the field of higher education and common approaches will be developed so that from September 1, 2023, these universities begin educational activities according to Russian standards,"" the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia said in a statement. AND AT THIS TIME. Everyone will be assigned a curator. The Ministry of Education of Kherson region adopted a decree according to which all educational institutions will continue the educational process, both in correspondence and in full-time form. To ensure the safety of students and employees of Kherson educational institutions, it was instructed to create all conditions for studying in remote mode. According to the Ministry of Education of Kherson region, each student of universities and secondary vocational institutions will be contacted by their curator and individually choose the form of training. Teachers are beginning to use Russian educational platforms."

The Ministry of Defense of Russia set specific goals for front-line creative brigades: to conduct regular cultural and artistic services for fighters in the zone of the special operation, to collect army folklore and to accumulate unique experience of artists in combat conditions. It should be noted that the First Front-Line Creative Brigade of the Ministry of Defense of Russia left for the joint grouping of troops (forces) in November 2022. In addition to personal weapons (all have passed the training camp and know how to wield weapons), the musicians have all the necessary musical instruments, equipment and microphones.

The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on December 14, 2022. The LPR reported that the Ukrainian military used electric chairs to torture civilians. Torture facilities were discovered, where the Armed Forces of Ukraine mocked civilians. The Russian Armed Forces killed more than 40 Ukrainian soldiers and foreign mercenaries in the Kupyansk direction. In other areas, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 130 people. An air alert was announced throughout Ukraine on December 13, 2022. Warning signals are heard in all regions. France will send a new batch of air defense systems to Ukraine. Foreign Minister Colonna said that part of the air defense systems have already been transferred to Kiev. Residents of Kherson complained about the deterioration of life due to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Now in the city there are power outages and there is no water supply. General Magowen reported on the participation of British marines in covert operations in Ukraine. He said the Marines conducted operations with a high level of political and military risk. Pushilin said that Russian troops will soon liberate Maryinka in the DPR. More than 70% of the city's territory is already under fire control, the acting head of the DPR noted.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4692554/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-14,"Revealed the biggest military secret, which Zelensky carefully hid",Hackers broke into the archive of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with data on the missing Ukrainian military,"The most terrible thing for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team is not even the offensive of Russian troops, but information. Which is not distorted by his regular ""mouths of lies"" by Arestovich and Podolyak, but real, honest and truthful. It is not for nothing that the bank banned not only the photo and video shooting of the arrivals of Russian cruise missiles, but now reports on the next changes in the Ukrainian air defense - they will still not check. As, for example, today in Kiev, where at least 4 explosions thundered, and Zelensky reported that ""all the geraniums"" were shot down by valiant thieves."" But an even bigger torpedo into Zelensky's sinking ship is information about the number of these very dead ""scribblers"". How kiev soared to the ceiling when Ursula von der Leyen accidentally told about the 100,000 dead. They literally started splashing saliva in all directions. -Untruth! Misha Podolyak squealed, saying that only about 13,000 ""warriors of light"" died. - Not true!, - Zelensky raged, saying that the death toll on the Ukrainian side barely exceeds 9 thousand people. The onslaught was so fierce that Ursula immediately gave up, and her assistants not only reported that their shemines were using incorrect data, but also apologized for her. By the way, she herself did not apologize. And it is impossible not to agree with them on at least one – of course, it is not true, because the real number of dead soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is much higher than the figure voiced by the head of the European Commission. Hackers from the Anarchist Kombatant group hacked the relevant resources of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and published a certificate of the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine addressed to the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Sergei Shaptala, in which the number of dead recognized as missing was named with an accuracy of one person. That's 35,382 people. Once again, 35,382 dead servicemen of Ukraine were officially recognized as missing. These are not all the dead, these are those who remained unburied to lie on the battlefields, at best, they were buried by our servicemen in mass graves, but many still lie. And these are not prisoners. - In the appendix to the letter - a complete list of all the dead, but missing servicemen as of November 30, 2022, - reports the Telegram channel that announced the successful attack of Russian hackers and cites the ""blunder"". - Most of the ground forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - 667 sheets with names, surnames and dates of birth. Then theroborona (546 sheets), airborne assault troops (398), special operations forces (316) and representatives of the Navy (242 sheets). At the same time, it should be borne in mind that most of the dead Ukrainian soldiers and officers still reach those cities and villages from where they went to serve, and where they find their last refuge. So 100,000 dead is not the whole ""bouquet"". Moreover, a few days earlier, a list of dead officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine appeared on the Web. The list includes 1435 people with names, surnames and titles. Again, a complete ""mess"" - 80 second lieutenants, 291 lieutenants, 440 senior lieutenants, 263 captains, 179 majors, 120 lieutenant colonels and 62 colonels. There are also foreign mercenaries in the officer ranks of the armies of those countries where they served before, but now we are talking only about Ukrainians. Almost fifteen hundred dead officers, and, perhaps, in reality, there are even more. And at least two factors must be taken into account. The first is that officers in the Ground Forces (with the exception of special forces units, there is another ""porridge"") and theroborone command units starting from the platoon, in Ukrainian realities it can be twenty or thirty people). The squads are commanded by sergeants. And the second is that officers die not just in fewer cases than privates, but two orders of magnitude less often. If not more. Less often they go on the attack, less sit in the trenches on the very front - this is the fate of lieutenants, from junior to senior. And, starting with captains and above , these are already companies, headquarters of battalions, regiments, brigades, dugouts in three rolls, NP, CP and a great distance from the front line itself. The only exception here is among aviation and, partially, artillery. This is already, according to all the laws of physics, mathematics and just war, not even 150,000 dead, but much more. And this is the biggest military secret that Zelensky keeps, afraid to reveal it not to the enemy, but to his country. ""Some say that the concealment of this information is caused by Zelensky's desire not to pay compensation to the families of the victims. Like, missing - it's not necessarily dead, maybe even swept over. Out of sight, out of mind. But the issue here is not only about money – voicing real losses will cause a rush, and then a riot in which Zelensky and his team will drown, torn to shreds by fierce rebels against him and his power. Moreover, at first glance, paradoxically, but now Zelensky is interested in the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to suffer as many losses as possible. From Russia, he hopes, he will be protected by the West. But from their... And the fewer armed Ukrainian soldiers remain alive, the more chances Zelensky will have either to put down the rebellion by security forces loyal to him when everything is revealed, or, at worst, to save his own skin. The forest of weapons, dispositions and plans of the General Staff in Kiev hide the real number of dead Ukrainian soldiers. But the truth still comes out like zombies from the graves. LISTEN AS WELL.

Chevrons (of course, non-statutory) are also in the conditions of the SVO the attitude of fighters to their tasks and to the enemy, a reflection of their worldview. Our adversary widely and with blunt seriousness uses the symbols of the German Wehrmacht and SS units of the Second World War, emphasizing its Nazi essence. And Russian guys, on the contrary, demonstrate a sense of humor, sometimes black, and self-irony. In fact, the type and location of regular chevrons are regulated by the order of the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation No. 300 of June 22, 2015.

At the same time, air raid alarms were also sounded in Zhytomyr and Vinnytsia regions. Both of them are located just west of the Kiev region. The mayor of the capital, Vitali Klitschko, said in the morning in his telegram channel the following: ""Explosions in the Shevchenko district of the capital. Services go to the place."" An hour later, the former world boxing champion, who became the mayor, made a statement that in the Kiev sky, valiant Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners were able to shoot down ten drones. Administrative buildings were damaged. The head of the military administration of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba, in connection with the drone attack and the operation of air defense systems, appealed to residents to stay in shelters until the end of the announced air alert. After 9 a.m., it became known about the second wave of an air attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine, on which the supply of military equipment and personnel from the central and western regions of the independent to the conflict zone in the Donbas depends. Professor of MGIMO, Director of the Center for Political Studies Oleksiy Podberezkin on the air of Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda, answering the question of the presenter Maria Bachenina, recalled that there are no electricity generation facilities in the Shevchenko district of Kyiv. Therefore, there could not be objects for a drone attack there either. - Most likely, this is again the self-detonation of missiles of the old S-300 complexes of the Ukrainian air defense, - Suggested Mr. Podberezkin, - Inept shooting at an air target can lead to the fall of its fragments, remnants - and lead to significant destruction in the residential sector. This has happened more than once in the same Kiev. It may also be the remains of obsolete Buk sam missiles of Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners. The professor also expressed confidence that there can be no question of any ""conscious violation of the energy structure of one of the central districts of the Kiev capital. There is destruction and damage characteristic of the defeat of the remains of anti-aircraft missiles. When asked about the state of the Ukrainian energy sector, which, according to the leaders of the Kiev regime, is destroyed by more than half, and about the possibilities of correcting the situation, Oleksiy Podberezkin answered as follows. - As for Ukraine's ability to import electricity from Europe. The technical possibilities are there. But will Europe sell, and in what volumes? And the people in kiev who are in power should understand that the murder of civilians in Donetsk, Horlivka, Makiivka does not just happen.

""Beat the enemy, sparing neither him nor himself, the one who feels less sorry for himself wins,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle.

Corporal Artem TRANSPORTATION. In the course of repelling the enemy's offensive, reinforced by armored vehicles, there was a threat of breaking through the defenses on the line held by the unit, which included Corporal Artem Perevozan. Quickly assessing the situation, the senior rifleman of the motorized rifle company, Corporal Transportation, secretly moved to the flank of the advancing enemy. Waiting for the armored vehicles to approach the line of confident defeat from the standard anti-tank weapons, he set fire to two armored vehicles with several accurate shots. The enemy's motorized infantry, having lost fire support and being under the heavy fire of the Transportation detachment, retreated in a hurry.

As a result of another salvo of enemy artillery, the station, which provides communication inside the BTGr and with the higher command, received fragmentation damage from a shell that exploded nearby and failed. Despite the threat to life, Bessonov, realizing that the loss of communication with the higher command and within the units would make it impossible to quickly coordinate the actions of the forces in battle, moved with the crew to the damaged station and began to restore the equipment. Thanks to the courage and dedication of Bessonov, as well as the professionalism of his subordinates, Russian signalmen managed to quickly restore communication within the BTGr, which made it possible to transmit the coordinates of the enemy artillery positions, as a result of which they were suppressed by return artillery fire. For the courage and bravery shown in the performance of the combat mission, Captain Valentin Bessonov was awarded the Suvorov Medal."" A COMRADE COVERED THE RETREAT. Private Daniil Tyukavki. ""Acting as part of a group of Russian servicemen, machine gunner Private Daniil Tyukavkin during the battle provided cover for the unit. The enemy, using numerical superiority, made attempts to encircle Russian servicemen. In order to exclude the possibility of encirclement of the group, the commander decided to bring the unit to a more advantageous position. When retreating to new positions, Tyukavkin continued to cover the unit with fire. After the machine gun broke down, he took two machine guns captured from the enemy and continued to fight. Covering the withdrawal of the unit, he left the firing position last, until he was convinced of the withdrawal of the last man from his unit. Skillfully and competently changing firing positions, Private Daniil Tyukavkin did not allow the encirclement of the group and losses among the personnel, and also inflicted significant losses on the enemy, disrupting the nationalist offensive on the entrusted line of defense.

Not only are they seizing Orthodox churches throughout Ukraine, taking advantage of the persecution of the canonical UOC by the state and personally by the President of (so far) Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, they decided to additionally rob its parishioners. - Dear parishioners! In connection with the latest events, all baptismal rites conducted by priests of the UOC are canceled! You can sign up for re-baptism in the OCU with the priest - such announcements were full of churches in Ukraine. For real parishioners, these proposals cause a rush. Crossing according to the new one is a purely Ukrainian invention, a real heresy, but for the ""priests"" of the SCU this is not an argument, especially when there is an opportunity to earn, since baptism is supposed to be paid. And here the same Volodymyr Zelensky is simply obliged to subject his children to this procedure. And the eldest daughter, and especially the youngest son Kirill, who is now 9 years old. After all, Zelensky baptized him together with his wife not anywhere, but in the most ancient temple of Kiev - the St. Elias Church of the capital of Ukraine in its central district, in Podil. Zelensky then was even proud of this event and breathlessly told journalists about how the ceremony took place. - During the sacrament, Cyril behaved calmly. He is not capricious at all, although cheerful and mobile - he went to me, - Zelensky, who was then actively starring in Russian cinema and had not yet thought about the presidency, told StarHit. - A lot depends on the priest. He was young, kind and handsome. He spoke affectionately with his son, Kirill listened to him with interest. He cried only when he was pulled out of the font – maybe he wanted to swim some more. But he quickly calmed down – apparently, remembered that he was a real man. By the way, the cross, presented to Kirill, the parents then hid, saying that the neck is still thin, let the son grow up. Now, apparently, it is necessary to hide it again or change it for another. After all, now Zelensky is crushing the very denomination whose church baptized his children. And, apparently, she baptized him and his wife. By prohibiting canonical Orthodoxy, he forbids it both in himself and in his family members. Well, nothing, he will change his faith again, he is no stranger to it. After all, as the chief rabbi of Kryvyi Rih, Liron Edri, said, the father of the current president of Ukraine, Alexander, played a prominent role in the Jewish community of the city and often, although irregularly, attended synagogue. And Rabbi Michael Finkel noted that Zelensky is not a Jew, although he looks like him – Zelensky does not have a ""corresponding soul and self-consciousness"" because of the rejection of the ""faith of the fathers"" – Judaism. He abandoned Judaism in favor of Orthodoxy, and time passed, he abandoned canonical Orthodoxy in favor of schismatic Orthodoxy. So what? Or the president of Ukraine, an atheist who sells religion – fly to the sale, on Saturdays Shabbat, sorry, discount. It is the Ukrainian military that is now on the front lines recording videos with requests and demands to leave the canonical UOC alone. And for Zelensky, this is too small, he will cross, and even re-star, and, sweepingly, if he finds it useful for himself. And he will do it with the whole family. Nothing personal, just business.

African leaders spoke in favor of ending the conflict diplomatically. Taking into account the opinion of Kiev. Well, yes, accounting will happen - after denazification. Why Paris and Berlin remembered the sense of self-preservation so late. Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Federation Council, said that Germany and France show a sense of self-preservation when it comes to security guarantees for Russia and the principle of indivisibility of security in general. Kosachev said: ""A return to the principle of indivisibility of security is not a negotiating position of Russia, but the only possible guarantee of non-repetition of conflicts in the future. This is the only possible strategy for the future."" According to Kosachev, there is now a split in the West's approaches to this issue. For example, the leader of France proposed to think about what will happen after the end of the conflict in the independent country. In particular, about the new security architecture, which implies guarantees for all parties to the conflict. Outraged in Kiev and Warsaw, as well as in the Baltic countries. In vain, you are indignant - you need guarantees, first of all. The Americans are reviving the energy sector of Ukraine. Reuters reported that Washington sent the first batch of American equipment for the needs of the energy structure of the independent country. The first batch included equipment worth $ 13 million.

After the beginning of the SVO, the performer remained silent for six months and did not appear in social networks. Recently, she returned from Spain to Russia, and took part in the filming of a New Year's concert.

Ivan Prikhodko, the mayor of Horlivka, confirmed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled the territory of the Stirol chemical plant in this city of the DPR for the second time. Prior to that, Ukrainian militants conducted an artillery attack on Stirol on December 6. Four shells hit the territory of the enterprise.

The main task of the agent was to covertly shoot the station's security systems. Bloomberg told why the winter threatens to turn into a defeat for Ukraine.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4693410/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-15,"""Bakhmut executioner"" and exhaustion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: How much truth is there in the threats of the ""winter offensive"" of Ukraine",Political analyst Shurygin said in response to Reznik's words that there is no global offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"The head of the defense ministry, Alexei Reznikov, made a loud statement: ""My personal assessment is that our armed forces do not plan to stop in winter."" At the same time, the head of the Ministry of Defense himself noted that the Ukrainian side has stocks of winter equipment, three times higher than the critical level. And that APU ""just needs to wait until the ground becomes less damp."" Reznikov also believes that the speed of this winter counteroffensive of Ukraine depends on the supply of weapons from NATO countries. At the same time, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal admitted that his great country will suffer from electricity shortages in these difficult winter months. At the same time, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny reported to President Zelensky that ""everything is bad in Bakhumt."" So attack or flee. KP.RU turned to military experts for comment. Here's what a member of the ""Izborsk Club"" Vladislav Shurygin said. - What does the offensive statement of the Minister of Defense mean. - That means they're not really ready to attack. -That is. - We need to be critical of this. It is possible that this is an attempt to distract attention. Push in the misinformation. -What for. - The Armed Forces of Ukraine have huge problems. With weapons, with equipment, with equipment, with ammunition. - But are they so critical that the Armed Forces of Ukraine could not advance at all. - That's a question. Even though for the past two months they've only been saying they're about to start attacking? And yes, this is an open question. -Why. - If they do not start to advance, it means that in the battles of November-December, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, indeed, depleted their huge human reserves. Which they continuously threw, in particular, on the Bakhmut direction. For which the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny received the nickname ""Bakhmut executioner"". - So still - Ukraine's winter offensive is more likely to be - or rather not. - They will try to attack locally. They don't seem to have the forces for a global offensive anymore. But they will simply be forced to conduct winter offensive operations. They can't sit on the defensive. After all, it means to give the initiative to us completely. But there are no fools sitting there in the command. And here is the opinion of the expert of the Association of Military Political Scientists, Head of the Department of Political Science and Sociology of the Russian University of Economics Andrei Koshkin. - For some reason, by the beginning of December, everyone decided that it was winter that would bring a pause in hostilities. - But there are no such statements on either our side. Which would talk about the cessation of hostilities for the winter period. On the contrary, both sides are more likely to hear statements that the fighting will continue. There are specifics of warfare here. And this specificity will be taken into account by everyone on the line of combat contact. - In whose favor does winter play. - It depends on the terms of the collateral. This is not a plus if winter uniforms and special equipment cannot fail due to the fact that there are not enough tracked vehicles and civilian transport is used, which is not adapted to this. They complain that the roads are broken and washed away, and are waiting for them to freeze. If there are no heating points, the delivery of hot meals, this will not benefit the units preparing to attack. - Reznikov said that their stocks of winter equipment are 3 times higher than the critical level - that's what it means. - They are waiting for the road to freeze enough to bring the ""winter reserve"". But it's more of a political statement. There is no need for the military to say this. And since the Minister of Defense says this, it means that there was a need to launch just such information into a large information field. - Reznikov said that the speed of the offensive will depend on the military supplies of the West. - This is also a political statement. It should be a signal to the west - if you want us to move, advance - give us more weapons and equipment. On the other hand, there is a justification for our society – we are not given weapons, and therefore we do not advance! And, in general, serious experts come to the conclusion that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have the resources for significant offensive actions. Expect a paradigm shift... LISTEN AS WELL.

In 2014, the people christened the black fighter Black Lenin - after all, he justified all his adventures by the interests of the Russian world and the struggle for communism. The mulatto came to the front as a private in the Russian army in August. - I was outraged by the July shelling of the ZNPP and especially Donetsk. My mind boiled over indignantly, and I decided to go to the special operation zone as a volunteer. The beginning of the SVO surprisingly went into the hands of Benes Hristoforovich. The fact is that for the past eight years he has been unsuccessfully trying to obtain Russian citizenship. Recently, Benes lived with as many as three documents: a Latvian passport (by birthright), a DPR passport and a Russian refugee certificate. - And how did you get drafted into the regular army in the summer without our citizenship? Putin signed the law allowing this only in November. - I was taken into the Armed Forces of Russia as a citizen of the DPR. In 2016, I personally received a passport from the hands of Zakharchenko. - It turns out that now you are finally a citizen of Russia. -Yes. I was told that I would get a new passport in two weeks (already received. - Ed.). - Where do you serve now? What a title. - Territorially, I serve in intelligence, currently in the Zaporozhye region. But I also visit the Donbas direction, the Lugansk direction. I'm a private. - So you were an artillery sergeant! Just a scarce position. - Intelligence is new to me, so I'm a private. In the LPR, I was in the artillery. In the DPR, I served in a motorized rifle battalion. - You yourself have chosen where to serve and by whom. - I volunteered. I'm not mobilized. As you know, before the mobilization, the volunteers went to those units that, let's say, they are more in spirit, where they know each other, where they believe they can prove themselves better. - They react normally to skin color. - They react very well, they say: ""It is good that the guys of different races, different nationalities are now in this good deed, in the protection of Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions actually from the Euro-American occupiers. ... - There are already some awards. - Not at the moment. Well, I'm relatively recent, only since August. But I have the old ones - ""For the Defense of Lugansk"" and ""Soldier-Internationalist"". REFERENCE ""KP. The path that led Benes Khristoforovich to the fronts of the special operation turned out to be thorny. The mulatto was born in 1979 from a Ugandan RUDN university student to a Russian girl. He grew up in the east of Latvia. In the 90s he graduated from the Faculty of Biology of the University of Latvia. In the early 2000s, Benes went to marches in defense of the Russian language, pasted posters, and in 2005 he went to a Latvian prison for distributing leaflets with the text: ""Let's show the place to the cursed regime or just twist its neck."" After serving his sentence, Ayo moved away from sin to London. Here he received another higher education, also biological. In 2012, in The Hague, he took part in an action near the building of the Ministry of Justice and Security of holland - together with other activists he scattered leaflets, threw smoke bombs and stun grenades, for which he received 7 months in prison. In 2014, he went to Crimea to support the independence of the peninsula, and after summing up the results of the referendums, he moved to Donetsk. He was arrested by the SBU and deported to London, but still managed to get into the army of the DPR. He served there until 2020. At the same time, he received a master's degree in political science at the correspondence department of Luhansk Dahl University. Already in Russia, Benes once again thundered into the department. It turned out that Latvia put him on the international wanted list for terrorism, mercenarism and espionage. Police detained him at the request of Interpol. True, the authorities quickly figured it out and released the Afro-Latvian - in the end, everything that benes was accused of by the Balts, he did for the sake of Russia. In Moscow, Benes made a living on a construction site. And he spent all his free time participating in environmental actions of the Moscow Communists. Now the fate of the dark-skinned Russian has made a circle - he is back in Malorossiya, only not as a militiaman, but as a soldier of the Russian army and a citizen of the Russian Federation.

""Since 2014, the Investigative Committee of Russia has initiated 2287 criminal cases against 655 persons, including representatives of the military and political leadership of Ukraine, members of radical nationalist associations, as well as representatives of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. According to the investigation, as a result of the armed conflict, more than 4.8 thousand civilians were killed, including more than 130 minors. At least 8.5 thousand civilians were injured, more than 400 of them were children and adolescents,"" investigators of the Investigative Committee of Russia said at the meeting. According to experts of the department, more than 118 thousand people, including over 23 thousand minors, were recognized as victims of shelling of the armed formations of the Kiev regime. In addition, according to expert opinions, the total cost of restoration work on the territory of 61,000 houses and buildings in 12 cities of the DPR and LPR is at least 226 billion rubles. To date, the Investigative Committee of Russia has completed the investigation into 134 criminal cases, the defendants of which were Ukrainian servicemen who shelled residential buildings of civilians. The cynicism of the Ukrainian military amazes even investigators. So in the materials there is a case when the nationalists of the regiment ""Azov"" shot the village of Bezymyannoye on May 9, 2017 from a gun of the 1944 model. The time of the shelling of the settlement exactly coincided with the time of the solemn events held in it, when schoolchildren went to lay flowers at the monument that was installed in the Soviet years to the villagers who died during the Great Patriotic War. Also, the Chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia was informed about the circumstances of the investigation of the criminal case on the discovery of corpses in the fuel storage facility at the gas station in Severodonetsk. As part of the investigation, the bodies of civilians - a man and a woman with tied hands - were recovered from a depth of more than four meters with the help of employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. ""According to the preliminary assessment of the forensic expert, the victim has a gunshot wound in the head area. Documents certifying their identity were found with the victims. Currently, the investigation establishes all the circumstances of the incident and the persons involved in the crime,"" the meeting noted. Obviously, all this Ukrainian militants are taught in Poland and the UK. From the testimony of one of the mobilized citizens of Ukraine, it follows that he, along with other servicemen, was taken to a military airfield in Poland, from where he was subsequently transferred to a military base in the UK. For 35 days, they were trained in conducting combat operations in urban conditions, shooting small arms in various positions, adjusting artillery fire. The classes were conducted by instructors from among the servicemen of the British Armed Forces.

Rebecca Koffler, a former U.S. intelligence official, said it was time for the U.S. president to stop stoking the situation in Ukraine. It is time for him to make efforts to move the conflict into peace negotiations. In particular, because the US weapons stockpile is empty, and the countries involved in the conflict suffer enormous budget losses. Koffler added that the leader of Ukraine pursues unrealistic goals, and his desire to negotiate only with the new Russian leader does not pretend to take the situation seriously at all. The ex-intelligence officer assured that the people of the States, unlike Biden, are increasingly inclined to ensure that the conflict is resolved peacefully. As long as Zelensky is real, the goals are unrealistic, and vice versa. The next 300 million euros will go into the sand – and this is not the Dnieper peso.

Andrei Marochko, an officer of the people's militia of the LPR, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are experiencing an acute shortage of special vehicles. According to him, due to the shortage of tracked and wheeled special equipment, the Ukrainian army is increasingly using civilian vehicles that are not adapted for off-road movement and active hostilities. Problems with military logistics slow down the speed of the supply of ammunition, interfere with the evacuation of the wounded and the delivery of fighters to the positions. Due to the fact that the transport is not armored, the number of irretrievable human losses is growing. The road is winter, the doctor is driving, the powder is being carried. It will be worse.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4692832/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-14,"The use of Russian ""Terminators"" in battle turned Ukrainian soldiers into flight","The firepower of the ""tank support vehicles"" was an unpleasant surprise for the Armed Forces of Ukraine","An attempted attack on the Svatovo-Kremennaya line in the Lugansk People's Republic ended deplorably for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Fighters of the Russian military group ""O"" (""Brave"" - Central Military District) used combat tank support vehicles (BMPT) ""Terminator"". Their fire terrified the Ukrainian militants and forced them to flee their positions. The Ukrainian army has been trying to break through the front in the Svatovo area for several months. This city is of strategic importance, behind it opens the way to the depths of the LPR, including to Severodonetsk and Lisichansk. Svatovo is constantly shelled from Highmars, Ukrainian troops almost daily feel the defense, trying to break through the front. Now these attempts, among other military equipment, are opposed by the BMPT ""Terminator"". ""The situation is tense, but we are holding the front line, destroying the enemy's strongholds with artillery, tanks and heavy fire systems ""Solntsepek,"" the Russian military said. - When repelling several attacks, the Terminator helped us a lot, he literally turned the enemy into flight. BMPT ""Terminator"" is called ""tank on steroids"" or ""helicopter on caterpillars"". Produced by Uralvagonzavod, the Terminators were adopted by the Russian army as recently as 2018. Although the development began in the 90s. These machines are assembled on the basis of the T-72 tank, but they are much more maneuverable and able to quickly respond to the threat of attack from anti-tank systems. In the protection of tanks, in fact, is the main task of the ""Terminators"". They can detect and quickly hit even a fighter with a ""Javelin"" who has settled somewhere in the bushes. At the same time, according to experts, thanks to the dynamic protection of the Relikt, the Terminator itself is not so terrible anti-tank missiles. Mainly because the Relikt protects the entire perimeter of the vehicle, not just a 70-degree sector like the T-90 tank. The armament of the BMPT ""Terminator"", and these are two 30-millimeter guns 2A42, four launchers of guided missiles 9M120-1 ""Attack"", two AGS-17 grenade launchers and a 7.62-mm modernized Kalashnikov tank machine gun, allows you to conduct a single battle. This, apparently, contributed to the success of tank support combat vehicles near Svatovo. According to the above-mentioned military of the Central Military District, the Terminators and artillery inflicted a massive blow on the area of concentration of Ukrainian militants in the forest plantation, from where they were going to attack Russian positions. The fire was corrected from a drone, which managed to capture the reaction of the Ukrainians: many remained forever in the forest plantation, and the rest preferred to flee, throwing heavy weapons.

Kindergarten ""Lastochka"". From the very morning, the kids have a real adventure. They were visited by ""superheroes in white coats"": pediatricians, ophthalmologists and other doctors. Kind, smiling and very professional. Today they will thoroughly examine each baby. Not a single sore, if there is, God forbid, will go unnoticed. Free medical examinations of children continue in the region, which are carried out on behalf of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. According to Elena Petrenko, the mother of a five-year-old baby visiting Lastochka, she initially did not believe it when she learned that it was possible to check the health of the child from start to finish for free, and even right in the kindergarten. - After all, earlier, under the Ukrainian authorities, there was no such practice. Of course, our family took the opportunity. My daughter was examined by doctors. Fortunately, the baby's health is fine! She was seen by an ophthalmologist, a psychiatrist, and other narrow specialists,"" said Elena. Unfortunately, not everyone is so lucky. As one of the doctors, who introduced himself as Ivan Alexandrovich, commented, due to the fact that children were not screened annually, doctors are now identifying many pathologies in them that should have been detected in the early stages. - Often there are, for example, surgical pathologies. In order to stop the disease in time, such screening is carried out, - commented Ivan Alexandrovich. The Department of Health of the Zaporizhzhya region explained that free children's medical examinations started in early November. They are organized by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation together with the government of the Zaporizhzhya region. Now there are 8 medical teams from different regions of Russia in the region - a total of 102 medical workers. Among the specialized specialists are ophthalmologists, neuropathologists, psychiatrists, cardiologists and even specialists in ultrasound diagnostics. - Children need a professional examination. Now a lot of problems are found in children, and their parents call a special hotline and ask about the simplest things: how can you get a medical examination, where, when, - said the head of the department of preschool education of the Ministry of Education of the Zaporozhye region Larisa Artemova. According to the director of the regional health department Viktor Kuchkovy, he and his colleagues are faced with the task of examining all children in the region. - If necessary, additional examinations will be prescribed. If necessary, through the department, children in need of treatment will be sent to specialized medical institutions,"" Kuchkovoy said. By the way, doctors have already examined 10,129 children under the age of 18 years. Based on the results of the examination, a health map is drawn up for each child, and local doctors on the ground receive recommendations for individual treatment. - Doctors are very conscientious about their duties. Previously, there was no feeling that our children were still interesting to anyone other than us, parents. There was no sense that the state cared about families. All treatment was paid, so simply examining the child to understand what he has with health was a luxury that not everyone can afford. Few people found a material opportunity for this. And no one offered free medical examinations. So they ran to the hospital when they took it. I want to say a huge thank you to the doctors and the administration for organizing such work today, - Elena Petrenko shared her emotions. REFERENCE ""KP. Questions related to the medical examination can be asked to the operators of the hotline by phone +7-990-009-00-58 daily, except Saturday and Sunday, from 8.00 to 17.00."

According to him, the Ministry is making calculations on budgets aimed at improving the level of equipment and drug supply of medical institutions, as well as repairing buildings. - Of course, we need to increase the staffing of these territories with medical workers. Donetsk and Lugansk medical universities will join the system of higher Russian medical education, - said Mikhail Murashko. Speaking about medicine in the Zaporozhye region, the past authorities did not invest in its development for several decades. Under Ukraine, healthcare only grew old, both physically and morally. The concept of ""free medical care"" existed only on paper. ""There is money - you will be treated, there is no money - do not even count on anything,"" says Anna Pavlova, a resident of Melitopol. - More or less high-quality care could be obtained in paid clinics for a lot of money. The Zaporizhzhya region was part of the Russian Federation with worn-out hospitals, lack of drug supply and other problems. But now free medicine has returned to the region. ""There will be free medicine available in the region, including high-tech medicine,"" cardiologist Viktor Kuryanov, head of a group of doctors who came to Melitopol from the Almazov National Medical Research Center, said on the air of ZaTV. Today, the region continues to supply the missing medicines and equipment, specialist doctors from other cities of Russia come to fill the shortage of personnel. It should be noted that the new region of the Russian Federation, the federal center has already supplied more than 600 tons of drugs, including for the treatment of surgical, oncological, endocrinological diseases. Medicines are distributed to hospitals, FAPs, pharmacies. With pharmacies under the Ukrainian authorities, too, everything was not smooth. They were not enough, and in some settlements they were completely absent, however, as well as medical outpatient clinics. Now new pharmaceutical outlets are being actively opened in cities and villages. By the way, in the village of Timoshevka, Vasilyevsky District, not even a medical center worked for decades. In September, the construction of a modular hospital began there. According to the acting governor of the Zaporizhzhya region, Yevhen Balitsky, it will be a modern, equipped with all necessary medical center. - There are qualified personnel in the outpatient clinic. The module provides a number of premises fully equipped with everything necessary for the provision of medical care: a dental office, a gynecological office, a room for storing medicines and consumables, procedural and vaccination rooms, the acting governor specified. Work on this facility is carried out with the support of the government of the Novgorod region within the framework of a cooperation agreement and patronage assistance."

Each brigade has 25 people. Specialists came from Adygea and Crimea. Doctors come to the Kherson region ""on shifts"". So, specialists from the region-chief - Adygea - were in the Genichesk district in August and returned here again at the end of November to stay until the New Year. A whole team works to examine children: a pediatrician, a surgeon, a pediatric neurologist, an ultrasound doctor, a psychiatrist, a medical psychologist, nurses, a nurse and a laboratory assistant. Specialists brought with them the necessary specialized equipment and consumables. Doctors examine children, conduct psychological tests, take general tests and conduct ECG examinations. In some cases, according to indications, an ultrasound is done. Each child is worked with individually. Permission to conduct medical examination of children is signed by parents. The Minister of Health of the Kherson region says that almost everyone gives consent to a medical examination - people understand its importance. - This is a very important event, as a result of medical examination, hidden diseases are revealed. It is very important to detect these diseases at an early stage. The health of our children is the future of the entire nation. And in Ukraine, professional examinations of children were not carried out, - explains the Minister of Health of kherson region Vadim Ilmiev. So the parents are happy - now you can examine the child near home. Violetta's son is disabled. A woman with trembling tells how during childbirth one of the twins died, and the second lost the ability to walk independently. She says that Yarik was at the medical examination for a long time - for this she took him to Anapa. - Under Ukraine, as it was: if you do not give money, then you can not go to the hospital. No one treated or assisted for free. For the residents of Kherson, it was very unusual that medical care is free in Russia. Many people try to give money from old memory, but doctors refuse,"" Violetta told Komsomolka. By the way, in the spring volunteers from Russia presented Yarik with a new stroller. Now he can walk and move around peacefully. Before that, he spent six months in a wheelchair - small in size and constantly rubbing. For three weeks of medical examination in the Kherson region, 1614 minors were checked. The regional Ministry of Health assured that by the end of the year they will examine another five thousand local residents. ""Some of them have pathologies of pediatric, psychoneurological and surgical profile,"" said Akhmed Gumov, head of the pediatric team from Adygea. In the Genichesk district, the medical examination is already coming to an end. Soon, professional examinations will begin to be carried out in the Kalanchak and Skadovsky districts. Professional examinations will be held for all children of the Left Bank. For mobile medical examination, there are even special machines - mobile FAPs. They also came from other Russian regions."

Now Kherson residents are getting used to the new place of residence,"For someone, moving to a new city will be an important chapter in life, someone just came to wait out difficult times. Both of them understand that without the support of the authorities, volunteers and just not indifferent people, they will not remain. The family of Elena from Nova Kakhovka waited until the last moment that everything would get better. Home, work, school - it was very difficult to leave the usual way of life. But when shelling began near their apartment, the woman packed the belongings of her relatives in a day. We had to escape, and as quickly as possible. So two adults and two children ended up in Olginka, Tuapse district. They brought an old grandmother with them. - The main thing is that we are all together, and the conditions are very good. We were warmly welcomed, the staff of the boarding house where we live is polite, - says Elena. - We want to draw up all the documents, we did not have time to make a Russian passport at home, because we worked, there was no free time. Now they have written a statement. And we'll look at the situation. I would like to come back, but if it does not work out, then we will gladly stay here. Like the Krasnodar Territory, another southern region of Russia receives evacuees. Hundreds of people go to the Rostov region to get a roof over their heads. Tatiana and her teenage daughter took almost five days to reach the temporary stay. - Drove perfectly. People here are very kind, sympathetic, what is needed - please, we are satisfied with everything, - says a resident of the village of Malaya Lepetikha, Kherson region. - We are not making big plans yet. The main thing is that we are alive and safe. Viktor from Nova Kakhovka was evacuated in November to the Tuapse district of the Krasnodar Territory. For a month I completed the documents, received a payment of 100 thousand rubles and even found a job. Now he is thinking of staying in the Kuban. - It's great, just great! The food here is excellent. I started going to the gym to get in shape. The people here are very nice and friendly. The nature is beautiful, the climate is pleasant, I feel very comfortable here. I don't want to go home! - The man admits. A resident of the Kherson region Elena soon plans to change her residence permit. A female teacher has fallen in love with Anapa so much that she wants to stay at the resort and work with children. - Three days later, I received a call back from the Ministry of Education and was informed that there are a lot of vacancies in my specialty, teachers are needed everywhere. I believe that I am also needed, because I love my profession very much,"" she said. Elena plans to build her life in Russia. And there are all opportunities for this. But the main thing for a woman is her corner. In the near future, she hopes to obtain a housing certificate for the purchase of housing at the resort. The story of the large Nazarov family is similar to the rest of the stories of evacuees from the Kherson region - shelling, urgent collection of things and the road to the unknown. Then it seemed that surviving the fear of the future would not be easy. But after Alexander and Anna reached Anapa with their four children, it turned out that everything was not so bad, and most importantly - quiet and calm. - We have slept here for the first time in a long time. Now we are not afraid that there will be a arrival, and you and your children will suffer. And there they woke up from every rustle, everyone was on their nerves, - says the head of the family. After the move, anxiety was replaced by confidence in the future. The children went to school, there is temporary housing, they are fed and helped with paperwork. - We were so warmly received: both in the boarding house and just the residents of Anapa. They help everyone. They brought diapers, shampoos, creams, gave a winter stroller for the youngest daughter. People collect humanitarian aid and regularly bring it to us. Of course, we did not expect this, - admits Alexander. In his native village of Krynki, the man worked as a coach, graduated from the Kherson Higher School of Physical Culture. His wife is a cook by profession. Therefore, spouses will not be left without work. They have already submitted documents for a housing certificate. They believe that they will be able to establish life in Anapa, and preferably near the city, in a house with their own plot. - We are used to the fact that you can work on the land, grow vegetables and fruits. It is easier for us to stay in a private house, because there are a lot of us, - the man smiles. - The main thing is that peace should come. And the rest can be adjusted. THAT TIME. Evacuated residents of the Kherson region continue to receive Russian passports. On December 3, 114 new compatriots were handed documents in Tuapse. To date, more than 370 internally displaced persons who live in the area have received Russian citizenship. In total, there are about 4400 people in temporary accommodation centers on the basis of the health resorts of Dzhubga, Novomikhailovsky, Olginka, Nebug, Agoya, Lermontovo, Tenginki, Shepsi and Dederkoy."

In what hopeless situations do the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine find themselves?,The representative of the people's militia of the LPR Andrei Marochko spoke about the hopeless situation in which the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine found themselves,"Ukrainian servicemen refuse to follow the orders of their commanders. This was stated to the First Channel by the officer of the people's militia of the Lugansk People's Republic Andrei Marochko. According to him, the situation that is developing on the line of combat contact leads Ukrainian tankers to horror. It comes to the point that soldiers specially spoil armored vehicles - drain oil from tanks, solar, spoil the fingers of caterpillars. Just not to participate in hostilities. ""There were cases when the commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine brewed tankers in cars to force them to go on the offensive,"" the officer said. We turned for a comment to the representative of the LPR Andrei Marochko. On the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" he confirmed the above facts. ""Back in the summer, soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine massively recorded appeals to Zelensky that they massively lacked security and that they refused to follow orders,"" said Mikhail Antonov, a presenter at Radio KP. - There were several videos at once, then there was a lull. Now such videos appear again. And you say they refuse to follow orders. It's happening on a one-off or a mass scale. ""Yes, there was a moment when the Security Service of Ukraine worked very effectively with servicemen who recorded such videos and told the real state of affairs in the Ukrainian army,"" said Andriy Marochko. - The fact is that this was mainly due to the mobilized military personnel. The SBU managed to calm them down. Now the situation is different. The videos are recorded by both mobilized servicemen and cadres. The situation in which the Armed Forces of Ukraine find themselves is deplorable. And you can't hide an awl in a bag. The Ukrainian military has found ways to circumvent the bans of the SBU. They either post videos anonymously, or take desperate steps and record videos from the whole unit. And in such a way that formal charges cannot be brought against them. When they are thrown on embrasures without providing the means to confront our army, they find themselves in a desperate situation. They either record such videos, or go to certain death. - Now what is the situation in the contact zone in the LPR. - I would describe it as consistently tense. The defensive line has stabilized, and we are in full control of the areas for which we are responsible. There are positive developments. And it's not one direction. There are successes in the Kupyansk and Krasno-estuary directions. Today, our General Staff announced that another attempt to break through the defense line from the Ukrainian side turned out to be extremely deplorable for those servicemen who tried to do this. Once again, they suffered heavy losses. LISTEN AS WELL. Will the fourth offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine take place?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4692775/,Sergey SOTNIKOV,2022-12-13,Igor Telegin: The Victorious People,How in the Kherson region in a few months the chaos turned into order,"In the first week of the special operation, all the authorities of the Kiev regime left Kherson. The regional administration, the SBU, the police - like the wind blew away. It wasn't even anarchy that began, but real chaos, looting and looting became everyday things. On March 2, Russian troops entered the city, and then the formation of the administration of the Kherson region began. Film director Igor Telegin became one of the first who literally began to create order in society from scratch. Over the past six months, he had to endure dozens of threats, two assassination attempts and, despite everything, enter into the confidence of the people, hold Victory Day and a referendum on joining Russia. In March, the administration of the Kherson region consisted of only eight people. Igor Telegin was one of them. He was asked to head the department of domestic policy. Telegin has participated in the war in Afghanistan, and now he has accepted a new challenge. - No one has had such experience, - says Igor Telegin. - When the supporters of the Kiev regime left, they took away all the servers. There were houses, the population, some shops and everything. There was no power, so we had to create everything from scratch. And now it's a historical experience. But where to start? To work, it was necessary to build a plan of action. I just rolled up my sleeves and started thinking. Okay, I'll recruit a certain number of people, but do what? I needed to do domestic politics. And then I came up with the idea to write a program. He set goals, objectives and a plan for their implementation. The first thing to do was to stop the chaos in the city and calm people down. The population was already frightened, and from time to time shots were heard here, threats from the Kiev regime arrived, and there were terrorist attacks. On Victory Day, it became clear that Telegin was moving in the right direction. On May 9, the city had to hold a parade and take people outside. Then it seemed impossible, and in the end the result exceeded all expectations. True, not everyone was happy about Telegin's success in his new position. The Kiev regime was preparing terrorist attacks, hoping to eliminate the official. - Threats came from there, someone wrote ""death to collaborator Telegin"" on the door of the apartment. Another assassination attempt happened on August 22, right on the Day of the National Flag. I was walking home from work that evening. They tracked me down that road in the morning. And on the way back, 200 grams of TNT exploded right behind my left leg. I was thrown back by an explosion, I received a concussion, as well as multiple shrapnel wounds to my back and leg. Miraculously, he survived. After being wounded, Igor Telegin began to form the ""Combat Brotherhood"" in the Kherson region. His candidacy for the post of chairman was approved, and the man began to work. - Combat brotherhood is the foundation on which the patriotic education of our youth, who have been brainwashed here for 30 years, is based, allegedly we are victims of repression, the Holodomor and so on. They wanted to take away our identity from us. But try to break the winner - it will not work, so they made victims out of us: whine, cry, there was no Great Victory - this is how 30 years were washed. And we begin to revive the memory of the exploits of our ancestors, and we do it just through the ""Combat Brotherhood"". Young people need to be persuaded through our great traditions. Through Suvorov, Alexander Nevsky and Zhukov, because we are the victorious people."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4692667/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-14,America promised Ukraine Patriot air defense systems. Why do installations need Independence?,Plans to send Patriot to Ukraine may be announced as early as this week,"The American television channel CNN, citing its high-ranking sources in Washington, reported that the United States is completing consultations on sending Ukraine the most modern Patriot air defense systems in the West at the moment, and plans for sending may be announced as early as this week. It is planned to transfer to Kiev one battery of an anti-aircraft missile system (SAM), which includes, in addition to radar and other technical support vehicles, from four to eight launchers, each of which has four standard missiles. That is, in transport and launch containers (TPK) to Ukraine will bring from 16 to 32 Patriot air defense missiles. How many missiles will be delivered as additional ammunition is not reported. The weapon is serious, needless to say. But to consider it another ""wunderwaffle"", as they have already begun to dance with joy in Kiev, there are no sufficient grounds for this. According to American journalists, it was announced that an agreement on supplies would be reached at the end of this week. Therefore, within a week, the papers must be signed by the US Secretary of Defense, another week is given to receive a sanction from Biden. So before the New Year, the complexes are unlikely to go to Germany, where, as reported, the Ukrainian military will be trained to work for them. Another two to three months will be required, at a minimum, for this training. So before March-April, the American Patriot air defense systems will not take up combat duty in Ukraine. If this happens in a shorter time, then there are only two options for implementing such a scenario. The first is the option when the American servicemen themselves will work for them, who will be brought along with the installations. And this is a direct involvement in the conflict of the United States. However, Biden, who devotes his leisure time to breaking children's bicycles and getting to know his close relatives anew, may not be told about it. The second option means that the Ukrainian military has been undergoing training for some time (and it is not known which one) on the Patriot air defense system, which is in service in Germany. With the secret permission of the German Ministry of Defense and Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Anyway, a new international scandal. But even if everything is implemented according to the best scenario for Kiev, to believe that the Patriot will change the course of the conflict is excessive naivety. Why does Kiev need these air defense systems? Zelensky gives a completely unequivocal answer - to close the sky over the objects of energy infrastructure. And that's the first lie. Because the launchers work directly with the battery command post, where all the information on the targets being tracked is located, and where the commands come from. That is, to put one PU in Dnepropetrovsk, the second in Zaporozhye, and the third at the Rivne NPP. They should cover one area or one sufficiently large object. And we can even say with confidence that this object will be Kiev. Zelensky will try to secure the place where he himself works, and where the largest number of Ukrainians live in one square. And the rest in this case will remain without cover. Patriot complexes are not just expensive, but very expensive. The cost of one battery of air defense systems in full configuration is about one billion US dollars, and one missile, depending on the modification, varies from 3 to 6 million. At the same time, it should be taken into account that the Patriot air defense systems can be effectively used only against Kalibr cruise missiles or aircraft. No, you can also shoot down the Gerani, and, probably, it will be possible to shoot down (although not a fact), but spending several million dollars on a target worth several tens of thousands of bucks is still the same microscope (and even electron) to beat nuts. By the way, for sure these air defense systems will be delivered not under the grant program, but will be included in the program of the so-called ""Lend-Lease"", for which you will then have to pay, as well as for other debts. And against ballistic missiles, the Patriot is useless. This was revealed in Iraq when Saddam Hussein's Scuds flew past them without suffering any casualties. The Patriots screwed up in 1991, when they smashed the US Marine barracks in Dhahran, and in recent years, when the Houthi rebels slapped their Scudami and even drones at strategic targets in Saudi Arabia. So only cruise missiles remain from the targets of the air defense system, in particular, our Kalibr, the production of which, according to the calculations of Russian experts, costs 300-500 thousand dollars. And now – attention! The effectiveness of work against patriot air defense systems aircraft is 0.8. But against the missiles - 0.3-0.4. That is, in order to be guaranteed to shoot down one target missile, it is necessary to launch two or three anti-missile missiles. The Americans, in order to try to shoot down the same ""Scuds"", launched 4 Patriot missiles at once, and the drones of their air defense systems in Saudi Arabia simply blinked. Well, the fact that for the Russian military installations of the Patriot air defense system will become priority targets, so do not go to the grandmother. By the way, both Americans and Europeans are not in vain afraid to supply Ukraine with their most modern weapons, since their vaunted combat characteristics often burst with soap bubbles when confronted with real Russian military equipment. So you think a couple more times, gentlemen, about the supply of Abrams and Leopards, then measure seven more times, but we do not recommend cutting it off. Categorically. Moreover, the same German Leopards burned in Syria no worse than the American Abrams earlier in Iraq. The Patriot is also pretty much soaked, so why else and additionally trample it into that very substance. LISTEN AS WELL. Will the fourth offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine take place?"

For six months in the new region of the Russian Federation, Sergey Eliseev was awarded the Order of Courage. In a conversation with Komsomolka, he summed up the main results of his work in Kherson, spoke about assistance to the common population, threats against him from Ukrainian militants and suggested that his successor would have to decide. - Sergey Vladimirovich, you have created a new government of Kherson region from scratch. - That's right. In six months, we managed to create the entire structure of the new government. We have brought the work of the authorities in line with the regulatory framework of the Russian Federation. After all, kherson residents lived up to this moment in the conditions of an independent subject. Yes, we had difficulties with personnel, a huge shortage of managers. People were afraid to cooperate with the new government, because they were intimidated by the Ukrainians. In social networks and calls, they received threats that they would be found and killed. - There have been cases of attempts on life. - Unfortunately, yes. On several occasions, my guards filmed various explosive devices hidden or camouflaged in my travel routes. All this had a negative impact on the formation of a new government. Therefore, the most courageous Kherson residents cooperated with us. - How to organize effective management in such conditions. - Several regions of the Russian Federation were assigned to the region: Ryazan, Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kaliningrad and Pskov. They distributed among themselves the districts of Kherson, which were closely helped on all fronts. One of the main tasks of our chefs was precisely the training of the staff. It seems to me that we have coped with this task. A quality government has emerged. - How was the situation in agriculture. - It was extremely important to ensure the harvesting of grain crops. Together with the district administrations, we have created state unitary enterprises (SUE). They bought grain from the population and sold it outside the Kherson region. We have ensured that prices are market prices, without speculation. As a result, more than one million tons of grain crops were harvested. Eight elevators were launched for receiving, processing and storing grain. New combines and grain carriers have come to us. We bought the right amount of fertilizer. As far as the military situation allowed, we sowed the fields. - What about the industrial sector. - It should be noted that the management of many enterprises fled to Ukraine, opposed Russia. These enterprises were recognized as ownerless and, through the decision of the commission, were transferred to temporary management to new directors. So that the team works, and people receive a salary. But now, I must admit, almost all of the enterprises remained on the right bank, or in the 15-kilometer zone of the left bank, which was evacuated due to shelling. - To what extent social assistance to the population has been established. - Organized social and pension payments. We have not seen a single Ukrainian database. From scratch, we recalculated the entire number of pensioners and needy residents of the Kherson region. At the time of my departure, we verified about 215,000 pensioners. More than 70 thousand people received social payments. Salaries were paid steadily. - Educational institutions have worked in full. - To the maximum. On September 1, we launched schools, colleges and universities. Almost 25 thousand children went to study. - And in the field of health care there are successes. - We have launched the work of about 60 polyclinics and hospitals. A legal entity was re-registered, new chief doctors were appointed. And they also established the supply of medicines and equipment. - How kherson residents themselves have changed in six months of your work. - I believe that my greatest achievement is a change in the mood of the population. If at the time of my arrival there were many doubters, afraid, then by the referendum the situation had changed radically. People were not afraid to openly express their opinions, work with us and help us. I immediately said to all my subordinates: ""They will judge by you who the Russians are."" We were the first, and the first impression is the most memorable. It was important to do everything right, and we succeeded. - What are the future challenges facing your successor. - The successor, of course, will not be easy because of the evacuation of part of the population and government structures. Now the main thing is to establish effective management of the territory in the shortest possible time. I know that an entire government quarter will be built on the left bank. It is extremely important to ensure a decent life for evacuated people, because many have parted with their homes. It is crucial not to forget anyone - so that everyone receives the necessary payments, housing certificates. Well, so that ordinary everyday affairs were solved without problems - it was warm in the houses, the roads in winter were sprinkled with sand and salt. I believe that everything will be fine. THE QUESTION IS RIB. What is happening to people on the right bank of the Kherson region. - The Ukrainian authorities are engaged in repressions. For the slightest suspicion of sympathy for the Russian authorities, for the fact of obtaining a Russian passport. Even for the fact that the child was sent to a Russian school. For all this, people face criminal prosecution. Not to mention the fact that the UK is now conducting checks on the fact of death executions on the right bank. There's mayhem going on there."

As well as the desire of the White House ""to exert pressure on Russia."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he met with U.S. senators and then visited Congress to meet with members of the House of Representatives. Blinken said: ""What I heard there indicated continued strong bipartisan support for the efforts we are making to help Ukraine defend itself, to continue to press Russia to end this aggression, and to continue to strengthen our defence within NATO."" Girls, you can't fight. U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said Washington was not at war with Moscow. And does not seek conflict with her. However, it will continue to supply weapons to Kiev. And it will do so for as long as it takes. Ryder said: ""We are focused on providing Ukraine with the security assistance it needs to defend itself. We said we would do this long before Russia decided to launch an invasion. We will continue to do so for as long as necessary."" Stability is a sign of class. Or declassification. Secret documents of the SBU show that the Kiev regime has created an agent network from among the Lebanese Habashites – representatives of a religious movement with signs of a sect – in order to control the Crimean Tatar community in Ukraine. And community activists are under surveillance. A source of RIA Novosti in the Russian special services said: ""To control the religious sphere of life of the Crimean Tatars, the Ukrainian special services involve representatives of the Lebanese religious movement - Habashism - an odious trend in Islam, which has signs of a totalitarian sect. They are intolerant of other forms of Islam. Including, traditionally professed by the Crimean Tatars."" As follows from the secret documents of the SBU, they conduct surveillance of representatives of the Crimean Tatar community, limiting the possibilities of free religion, building mosques, while providing comprehensive support to the structures of the Habashit DUMU. Kiev is putting pressure on the Crimean Tatars, who allow negative assessments of the activities of the DUMU and Tamim. Freedom of religion? No, you haven't. At a meeting of the UN General Assembly held on Friday night Moscow time, a resolution submitted by Kiev condemning the alleged human rights violations allegedly recorded in Crimea was adopted. The draft document calls on Moscow to take measures to immediately put an end to all ""violations against the inhabitants"" of the peninsula. Violations include ""arbitrary detention and arrest, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, sexual and gender-based violence."" No one has given any factual evidence of such nonsense - and it was not required. Still, it is necessary to hold a visiting session in Yalta, Sevastopol or Kerch for human rights fighters who are staying in New York. The Land of the Rising Sun provides official development assistance for diplomatic and humanitarian reasons. This also applies to the funds allocated to 19 countries that did not support the UN resolution condemning the special military operation of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said: ""Assistance includes funds sent to countries through international organizations and through local non-governmental organizations. The lack of support for the resolution by these countries does not automatically make the aid sent to them automatically inappropriate."" In total, it was decided to allocate 12.8 billion yen ($ 91 million). Most of this amount should be received by Laos ($ 20 million), Vietnam and Iran will get $ 12 and $ 11 million, respectively. Also on the list of recipients of assistance are Kyrgyzstan, Ethiopia, Nicaragua. The alignment is with the Japanese. Adviser to the head of the DPR Igor Kimakovsky said that in the Czech Republic they are riveting drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He said: ""In the Czech Republic, they are trying to deploy the production of Ukrainian drones. And they hire Ukrainians right in this country."" According to Kimakovsky, given the energy problems in Ukraine, it is not possible to deploy weapons production there. At the same time, he added, if such attempts are made, these objects become targets for Russian strikes. And the Czechs are still in the house. Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State and former ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES on national security, announced a turning point in the conflict in Ukraine, which should be used to reach a negotiated settlement and avoid escalation, fraught with a global catastrophe. Kissinger's article titled ""How to Avoid a New World War"" is posted on the website of the British weekly The Spectator on the eve of the release of saturday's issue of the magazine. Listen to Old Man Henry — Nixon and Ford's former right-hand man won't lie. The Croatian parliament voted against Zagreb participating in the EU mission to train the Ukrainian military. They do not want to become hostages to the political differences of the leaders of the countries. The Croatian Constitution does not provide for a vote in Parliament on matters that are normally approved by the President in consultation with the Government. Earlier, the reluctance to train the dogs of war from the independent was expressed by the Hungarian parliament. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4694087/,Marina SMIRNOVA,2022-12-15,Water conduit of hope,"The project of a new water pipeline for Donbass will be no less important and large-scale than the Crimean bridge for the peninsula, which in 2014 returned to Russia.","On November 25, Ukrainian artillerymen broke the pumping station and the third rise of the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal. As a result, a humanitarian catastrophe almost happened in the republic - the region was left without its main waterway. Specialists from Moscow, who came to the DPR to help, established the delivery of water. Drinkable in bottles by trucks - to distribute free of charge to the population - and technical tanker trucks - for boiler houses. With the help of special equipment, the water with which the heating system is filled is collected from the mines and purified. ""There are enough flooded mines in Donbass,"" says Ivan Seltsev, a foreman at one of Moscow's construction companies. - So that hot water from the batteries is not drained by particularly cunning residents, we add a special paint to it. In such water you can no longer wash. We have to work seven days a week, around the clock, in shifts, but we do not complain. People need warmth. Also, Moscow builders drill artesian wells at boiler houses. Water from these wells is not suitable for drinking, but after filtration is suitable for boilers of the heating system. As for drinking water in bottles, you can get it in schools where distribution points are open. The same point is located on the first floor of the new building of the Prigorodny Railway Station (former supermarket ""Brusnytsia""). Bottled water is brought once every 2 - 3 days, the delivery schedule is posted in printed form on the door of distribution points. Through pipes, water in Donetsk, Makiivka, Yasynuvata and other cities is supplied every three days to certain microdistricts of the city. Recall that their list is sent by the company ""Voda Donbassa"" via SMS to subscribers of the telecom operator ""Phoenix"". Unfortunately, there is not enough pressure to deliver water to the upper floors, so residents gather at the water taps removed from the basements at the entrances on the street. Water is collected in turn. The procedure has already been worked out: for 2 hours, while water is supplied, you can even have time to wash it. According to Voda Donbassa, so far the water supply in the DPR can be maintained at the level of 25 - 30% of the required. - Despite the economical mode of operation of the water supply system, the supply of water in reserve reservoirs is limited due to insufficient natural replenishment. Therefore, all possible water bodies on the territory of the DPR are involved. Work was carried out on the supply of water from the Sadka River, the Western Dolomite Quarry of the Novotroitsk Mining Administration, volyntsevsky, Khanzhenkovsky, Olkhovsky, Zuevsky, Grabovsky reservoirs, - the company told Komsomolka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything possible to prevent the supply of water to residents. The other day, the building of the laboratory ""Waters of Donbass"" was shelled. Several staff members were injured. The schedule of water supply because of this shifted by several days. On November 16, after a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Marat Khusnullin, the acting head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, announced plans to build a water pipeline in the DPR from the Don River. ""Despite the fact that the project is complex and expensive, its implementation is scheduled for the first half of 2023,"" Pushilin said. When the construction is completed, the water situation in the DPR will radically improve. ""In terms of scale and significance for Donbass, I would compare this project with the construction of the Crimean bridge,"" economist Viktor Trofimov commented to Komsomolka. - I would hazard a guess that the construction will cost billions of rubles. But without an alternative to the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal blocked and broken by Ukraine, the republic loses its future as an economically successful region. And metallurgists, and coke chemists, and chemists - all need a lot of water. Much more than the population for economic and hygienic needs. You can't save on the future. According to the expert, the announced dates for the start of construction of a new water pipeline indicate that a maximum of specialists from different Russian regions will be involved in the implementation of the project. And the forces have already been tightened. After all, a year ago, no one thought about supplying water from the Don. - When the large-scale construction is completed, both our children and grandchildren will be proud of the project. After all, it will no longer be possible to declare a water blockade in Donbass. The Kiev regime will lose one of its favorite instruments of terror for the civilian population,"" Viktor Trofimov concluded. STAY INFORMED. The addresses of the points of distribution of industrial water, as well as the schedule of its delivery can be found in the city or village administrations, by phone or on the official website. Mayors of cities have repeatedly drawn the attention of residents that the schedule may be violated due to shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other unforeseen circumstances."

Through such a large-scale event, the Russian authorities decided to support volunteers who gathered and organized entire teams to help the residents of Donbass and the liberated territories of Ukraine. Participants of the movement throughout the year responded to any requests, formed humanitarian missions and even launched a mutual assistance service ""Good.Mutual"". Therefore, it was decided to establish a new special nomination of the award - ""#МЫВМЕСТЕ with Donbass"", among the spectators of which were young residents of the Zaporozhye region. For example, 17-year-old Elizaveta Glebova went to Moscow for the final of the forum. Together with her like-minded people, she went to the capital for a few days, held master classes and was at a dozen interesting meetings. She managed to visit the forum and look at the award from the outside. But next year she plans to take part and break into the final. - Although I did not participate in the award, but it was a valuable experience. Good friendly atmosphere and lots of new discoveries. And also a charge of motivation and understanding that I did everything not in vain! I want to help people even more, draw my friends and acquaintances into their volunteer circles and make more new discoveries,"" the participant said. In ordinary life, Elizabeth is engaged in volunteering among veterans, and also provides assistance to refugees. On December 5, the final was held, which was waiting for each participant of the forum. The main award was traditionally presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since young people from the Zaporozhye region have not yet fallen into the ranks of the participants of the award, but were only among the spectators, other guys were lucky to become winners. But during the #МЫВМЕСТЕ, they received not just a good time, but also a lot of useful master classes, a lot of new acquaintances and motivation. - Our guys went there last week. Everything went great, everyone was satisfied. Besides, we haven't had anything like this before. For young people, we can say, all ways of acquaintances, opportunities and exchange of experience were closed. Thanks to the organizers for arranging such wonderful events. We will strive for them, next year the guys will definitely become participants and finalists, - the press service of the Ministry of Youth Policy of the Zaporizhzhya region noted."

According to the explanation of the Ministry of Defense of November 8, 2022, such an amount is laid to privates in the position of a motorized rifleman. The Russian government supported the bill on the extension of social support measures to widows and widowers of combat veterans. This is an extension of the criterion according to which the disabled spouse of a deceased veteran who lives alone or with children is entitled to benefits. Earlier, deputies of ""United Russia"" proposed to provide benefits in cases where the widow (widower) lives with other persons, for example, with parents. The initiative was supported and will soon allow family members of combat veterans to receive a monthly cash payment established by the Pension Fund, preferential medical care, compensation for the cost of housing and communal services, as well as claim housing.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4694072/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-15,"Each ""bayonet"" is registered",Why did the President sign the Decree on the creation of a unified electronic database of military registration,"Recently, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the creation of a single electronic database of military registration. This applies to young people of military age, conscripts, contract soldiers, and those who are in the reserves. Why did the head of state (and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief) demand that this issue be resolved now? The answer is simple: the partial mobilization of reserves for a special military operation (SVO) revealed many punctures in the work of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff in this area. The President of the country thus admitted that paper workflow and means of information processing, which are used by military commissariats to account for conscripts, are hopelessly outdated. Yes, this was recognized even before the SVO by the leadership of the military department itself. Remember last year's famous visit of the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation to one of the Moscow military recruitment offices? Then Sergei Shoigu, not without sarcasm, noted that the work with documents due to the lack of computers is carried out by ""grandfatherly guerrilla methods"", when secret reports were laid ""in the hollow"". The necessary instructions have been given, but the amount of work is such that it cannot be shoveled quickly. It is necessary to process and clarify the data on almost 25 million people who are included in the so-called mobilization reserve. Therefore, everything will be done in stages. First, (in accordance with Putin's decree), the Ministry of Defense, together with the Ministry of Digitalization and regional authorities, is obliged to transfer data on citizens subject to military registration into electronic form by December 30 of this year. And then the government of the Russian Federation within the specified period will approve the stages of the formation of a single state resource, determine the operator for each stage, the procedure for maintaining the system, including the timing of the provision of information. Such a resource should be created before April 2024. Reflecting on this problem, lawyer Dmitry Ogorodov asked a reasonable question: why has the Ministry of Defense not yet created on a modern technical basis a system of military registration provided for by the Federal Law ""On Military Duty and Military Service"". The reasons are different and very serious. Back in those days when Anatoly Serdyukov was the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, the military department, in order to save budget funds, sharply lowered the status of military commissariats and reduced their number. Military enlistment offices were ""dispersed"", career officers were turned into civil servants. Many of them did not want to put up with this situation and went either to the troops or to the civilian. And those who remained, significantly reduced the salary. Vehicles were taken away from the military enlistment offices, and in addition, budgets were also cut. Money was not enough not only for computers and copiers, but also for paper. Almost all documents were filled out manually. Mountains of papers often gave rise to confusion and errors. But this, of course, is not someone's malicious intent, but outdated paper information processing technologies. The lack of up-to-date information about conscripts and reservists in military recruitment offices has caused many problems. Partial mobilization highlighted them. On this occasion, the same lawyer Dmitry Ogorodov said. - So it came to the point that after the announcement of partial mobilization, military enlistment offices sent summonses to disabled and seriously ill people who were not fit for military service. Given the task of calling up 100 people, some military recruitment offices sent summonses to 200 mobilizers. And the information about them was often outdated and erroneous. Such a fan mailing of subpoenas to everyone caused unnecessary political irritation in society. The lawyer is sure that the creation of such a state information resource is unlikely to harm law-abiding citizens who should not be called up (disability, other grounds). But evading the draft will become more difficult. Putin's decree on the creation of a single electronic database of military registration is of great strategic importance for ensuring reliable defense of the state. The head of state promptly responded to the problem, which was shown ""in full growth"" by partial mobilization. And he ordered to create a reliable mechanism for solving this problem. It is obvious that the Kremlin is closely monitoring all the shortcomings in the army, demanding to correct them. The president seeks to strengthen national security by making it easier for citizens to interact with military recruitment offices. It requires the executive branch to have an in-depth understanding of the quantity and quality of conscription and mobilization human resources. All this is done for their effective use in the interests of ensuring the defense of the state. This is also done to carry out more effective planned work on the preparation of the necessary number of military-trained citizens in the reserve. To ensure the transfer of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops, military formations and bodies from peacetime to wartime. In pursuance of Putin's decree, the order of the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation No. 700 ""On Approval of the Instruction on the Organization of Work to Ensure the Functioning of the Military Registration System"" appeared very quickly. This document describes in detail how accounting should be carried out in a new way. The goals are defined, the objectives are clear. Get to work, comrades!"

In the zone of their attention - worn and damaged communications,"The Armed Forces of Ukraine have been destroying the infrastructure of the LPR for the ninth year. Utilities, power lines are one of the main targets of Ukrainian militants. If we take into account that the heating mains were worn out by 80 percent under Ukraine, then after the shelling the picture is quite deplorable. Only in two months, Ukrainian militants inflicted 250 strikes on gas and heat supply facilities in the republic. And they damaged them. Therefore, builders and communal workers from almost all over the country gathered to help the LPR prepare for the winter. Equipment for starting heating came from the regions: block-modular, mobile boiler houses, pumping stations, valves and shut-off valves. And the seconded specialists became part of the emergency teams, which are now helping the housing and communal services of the LPR to survive. They patch, weld, repair and repair. Around the clock. Day in and day out. New brigades were created to quickly eliminate accidents on communications. - I used to work at facilities in Kherson, - says heat engineer Andriy Voitenko. - Now we work with the guys in the villages near Lugansk. Local residents call us their ""ambulance"", often asked to solve problems and not according to our profile. For example, they ask what documents to collect, who to contact about the registration of acts for housing broken by shells. We help in any way we can. At the same time, according to the acting head of the republic Leonid Pasechnik, in the main part of the republic, with the exception of Lisichansk, Severodnetsk, Rubezhne, Kremennaya, heating has already been launched, work to prepare for the entry into the winter has been completed by 98%. The territories listed by Pasechnik remain complex. Cities that are closer to the front and have suffered more from shelling are still more difficult to survive the winter. However, here everything is being done to provide residents with the necessary utilities. Thus, in Kremennaya and Rubezhne, power supply has been fully restored, in Severodonetsk - partially. ""There are problems with water in these regions, but they will also be solved,"" said Maxim Shugaley, head of the Foundation for the Protection of National Values."

Scientific and educational environment is being integrated into Zaporizhzhya region,"The II Congress of Young Scientists was held in Sochi. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with the forum participants - scientists and laboratory assistants of research institutes from all over the country. Discussing the problems and future of science, answering questions from the audience, the head of the country called one of the important tasks the provision of university teachers and employees of research institutes of new Russian regions with the same social guarantees and working conditions that their colleagues in Russia have. ""People who came and voted need to grow into the Russian reality, feel the advantage of joining the Russian Federation, and Russia needs to gain a foothold thoroughly,"" Putin said. In the new regions of the Russian Federation, including the Zaporozhye region, the scientific and educational infrastructure is in a difficult state. This is the state of buildings, structures, instrument base and much more. The President stressed that the renewal will require several tens of billions of rubles, and these funds will be provided for in the federal budget. According to the President, to make a big leap in science and help the annexed territories grow in this direction. In particular, scientists and universities of the Zaporizhzhya region and other liberated territories will be allocated grant support for research and development of new technologies. ""These are our people, of course, we must do everything to support them,"" Putin said. In the laboratories of universities, students will be able to develop new medical equipment, conduct biological research and experiments, invent in the agricultural sector, implement engineering, innovative and other ideas. The most important thing is that scientists of any age will be able to earn on their developments. The head of Rospatent, Yuri Zubov, who was also present at the Congress, said that he was ready to organize innovation support centers in every region of Russia. Such an opportunity will be considered for the Zaporozhye region. - Developers will be able to turn to innovation and technology support centers for help in patenting their invention and bringing the idea to economic gain. For several years now, such a mechanism of a tripartite agreement has been implemented, when the Ministry of Economic Development, Rospatent and the head of the region sign a document as a roadmap for the development of vertical directions to each innovative enterprise or university. The desire of inventors and rectors of universities to patent and dispose of their applications is important here,"" Zubov said. It is worth noting that from September 1, 2023, students of universities of the Zaporozhye region will begin to study in a new way - according to Russian standards. To this end, the Federal Ministry will conduct an analysis of curricula, disciplines, modules, and other components of educational programs. Higher educational institutions have already begun to be helped with educational literature, the opening of network programs and forms of double diplomas in 106 areas of training. Also, more than 6 thousand teachers were retrained. In addition, by analogy with federal departments in the regions of Russia, including the Zaporozhye region, the posts of deputy governors for science will be created. In some regions, these chairs have already been occupied by effective specialists. WHAT ELSE. Scientific organizations of the Zaporizhzhya region will receive grant funding from the Russian Science Foundation (RSF). Grants of the Russian Science Foundation will be able to receive organizations of the Zaporozhye region after the registration of legal entities. Now the necessary work is being done in this direction. In particular, the question of who will be the founder of scientific organizations in the new Russian regions is being decided. - Scientific and educational organizations will be able to submit applications when they receive the status of a Russian legal entity. Otherwise, we will not be able to pay money, our law says so. After the registration of legal entities, organizations will be able to fully participate in our competitions, - said Andrey Blinov, Deputy General Director of the Russian Science Foundation, at the II Congress of Young Scientists. The Russian Science Foundation conducts a competitive selection of scientific and scientific-technical programs and projects in the field of fundamental and exploratory research."

Such an integrated approach will now be used in working with young people in the Zaporizhzhya region. Taking as a basis the model that was built in Russia at the federal level, the authorities of the new region created the regional Coordination Council of the All-Russian Public and State Movement of Children and Youth under the Governor of the Zaporozhye region. ""The movement of children and youth in the Zaporizhzhya region will become a platform that will allow children to develop spiritually and morally, have equal opportunities for comprehensive development and self-realization, and in the future take an active part in the development of the country,"" said the Governor of the region Yevhen Balitsky. The work of the public and state movement of children and youth will be supervised by the Ministry for Youth Policy of the Administration of the Zaporizhzhya region. The department has already shown its professionalism and high-quality work with young people. ""In general, it's great when there is a system,"" says Galina Borodenko, a 20-year-old resident of Berdyansk. - Order, program and platform on which you can stand firmly on your feet. You feel needed, important, you understand that the state is interested in you, and you can realize yourself. An example of work with young people in the region can be called the youth forum ""YugMoloda"", organized by the youth movement of the same name, which took place not so long ago. He showed how open young residents of the Zaporozhye region are to everything new and interesting, how they are drawn to various kinds of activities. So, the first youth forum in Berdyansk was attended by 300 children from the Zaporozhye region. Leading experts in their fields held lectures and master classes for schoolchildren and students. ""We must realize how important it is to work for the benefit of our children, to create all conditions for their full development and creation,"" said Yevgeny Balitsky. - And the All-Russian Public and State Movement of Children and Youth will become a single movement that will unite all children's organizations and associations of our region and integrate them into a single association of youth in Russia. Educating young people is not loud words, but real deeds: the elders show a living example of how to act according to conscience. For example, on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, activists of the #ЮгМолодой movement ""We are together with Russia"" and the head of the Vasilyevsky district Natalia Romanichenko delivered humanitarian aid to families where children with disabilities grow up, as well as to veterans of the Great Patriotic War, as part of the marathon of good deeds. An important component of the work is the memory of our ancestors. So, activists of the #ЮгМолодой movement (pictured) visited the excursion in the Kamennaya Mogila reserve. The children visited the museum, found out how many cultural layers archaeologists found in the Zaporozhye region. And young people donate blood, hang bird feeders in the park, take animals left without owners and look for a new home for them - all good deeds cannot be listed. The main thing is that the guys grow up with the understanding that help and humanity are good and right. And with the realization of this, they become the future of our land."

The Day of the Unknown Soldier is dedicated to the exploits of warriors whose names have sunk in the heat of battle. Among the missing soldiers around the world, the largest number of them falls on the countries of the former USSR. Many died fighting the enemy during the Great Patriotic War on the lands of the Zaporozhye region, defending its civilians, exhausted by the Nazis. We tell you what this day was like in the region. On the Day of the Unknown Soldier, we remember those who did not return from the war, giving their lives for our future. We pay tribute to the memory of Soviet soldiers who fell without a trace on the battlefields. Their feat is immortalized in marble and bronze. ""Unfortunately, today in Ukraine and in Europe there is a real war with monuments to Soviet soldiers. But they can't respond to vandals who have no honor or memory. We will answer for them! - said in his telegram channel the governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky. - The Day of the Unknown Soldier is a special day for our people and each of us. Today we bow our heads before the soldiers, whose feat has remained unknown. Eternal memory to the heroes!. ""Our duty is to preserve the memory of the fallen and pass on the truth about the Great Patriotic War from generation to generation and to continue the search for the fallen soldiers,"" added Galina Danilchenko, head of the Melitopol administration. - ""Your name is unknown, your feat is immortal!"" - these words, inscribed on a granite slab on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the wall of the Moscow Kremlin, in the heart of each of us. On the Day of the Unknown Soldier, commemorative events were held in all cities and towns of the Zaporizhzhya region. So, in Melitopol, a rally was held near the memorial complex ""Mass Grave"". Representatives of the administration, commandants, volunteers and schoolchildren laid flowers at mass graves, monuments and memorials. - It is very disappointing when the feat of the people who protected us remains unknown. Therefore, Vladimir Putin in 2014 decided to commemorate December 3 as the Day of Remembrance of the Unknown Soldier, - said Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Administration of the Zaporizhzhya region Andriy Boyko. In Tokmak, which still lives under the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, this day is special, because for local residents the cruelty of the war is not a story from textbooks and the memory of the family of the great-grandfathers who fought. Despite the hostilities that are unfolding nearby, Tokmak continues to live, inspired by the Victory of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and is confident of the victory of the future - it is very much awaited here. ""This is a memory of our ancestors, of their heroic deeds, of love for our Motherland, which we are obliged to carry through our lives and pass on to the future generation,"" said Anton Titsky, head of the Ministry of Youth Policy of the Zaporizhzhya region."

Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause.

During the assault, the Imam personally destroyed the opponents in two fortified positions, after which, taking up the defense in the building, he organized a platoon fire system. The enemy, seeking to recapture the lost lines, launched a counterattack with the support of artillery. During the repulse of the attack, Imam Aliyev skillfully maneuvered the fire of the platoon and competently led the change of firing positions of the fire support equipment, despite the concussion received during the battle.

There are three versions,"After the explosion of a Ukrainian gift in the headquarters of the Polish police, the ceiling collapsed","Ukrainian weapons continue to sow chaos in the expanses of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Exactly a month ago, on November 15, a rocket landed near the East Polish village of Przewodów, killing two local residents. According to the most probable version, which was not denied even by the traditionally Russophobic officials of the United States and NATO, it was about the Ukrainian S-300 system, which for an unknown reason opened ""friendly fire"" on the border Lublin Voivodeship. Now the media reported on a new ""mysterious explosion"" - this time in Warsaw, and not anywhere, but at the police headquarters. The incident occurred on the morning of Wednesday, December 14, under the office of the head of the department - Major General Yaroslav Shymchik. The results are a collapsed ceiling, coupled with the hospitalization of the officer himself. Another nearby employee was slightly injured. However, instead of the expected ""hand of Moscow"" in the tragicomic terrorist attack, ... As reported by the Polish media, on December 11-12, a high-ranking police officer went on a working visit to Nezalezhnaya, communicated with colleagues from local special services, who gave him a grenade launcher. Let's leave behind the scenes the questions of how such a ""toy"" could be dragged across the Ukrainian-Polish border (the police is not an army, it is not supposed to have heavy weapons), and why to keep such a dangerous exhibit in a loaded state at all - any Varsovian will proudly remind you of the national proverb: ""Polska Nierzadem stoi"". Literally- ""Poland is in turmoil."" However, a rival agency, the prosecutor's office, launched a detailed investigation into the incident. CcTV footage is being watched, and eyewitnesses are being questioned. There are at least three versions: the police tried to study the gift, but could not cope with the unfamiliar device; it detonated itself (there is plenty of evidence of poor-quality ukrainian and Western weapons exploding in the hands of the shooters themselves); Finally, theoretically, a ""bookmark"" can be added to the grenade launcher so that it involuntarily fires after a while - however, in this case it is not very clear why. And all this once again raises the issue of shadow arms trafficking from Ukraine: dangerous ""toys"", including from the latest Western supplies, through smuggling schemes spread around the world until somewhere it rumbles – as on Wednesday in Warsaw.

He said: ""There is a run-in of drones. We started self-assembly. We have good technique. The developments were even before the CBO, and they continue. Exercises are held regularly."" According to Aksyonov, 19 defense industry enterprises operate on the peninsula with the volume of contracts for the state defense order worth more than 23 billion rubles. In particular, from the second quarter of 2022, the Fiolent plant, the Sudocomposite KTB, the Feodosia Optical Plant increased production by 35-40%. And then they will increase. Kiev, Crimea is not yours. Oleksiy Kulemzin, the mayor of Donetsk, said that the shells of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the massive shelling of Donetsk hit the dome of the Transfiguration Cathedral and the buildings of the Donetsk National Technical University. On Thursday night, Donetsk was subjected to the most powerful shelling since the beginning of the conflict in the Donbass in 2014. The Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 40 missiles from the Grad MLRS at the city. The Voroshilov and Kiev districts of Donetsk were affected. Under attack were the streets of Universitetskaya, Shchorsa, Bogdan Khmelnitsky Avenue, the city market. Civilians were killed again. But no one west of the Niemen sees any of this point-blank. Air raid sirens sounded on December 15 in Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovograd, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions. This follows from the data of the official Ukrainian resource for notification. Alerts in six Ukrainian regions were announced within 5 minutes of the morning on Wednesday, December 15. Bankova was bent over. Perhaps this is a harbinger of the Ukrainian winter offensive against the Russians. Or retreats. The Washington Post reports that Washington will send Kiev the best electronic equipment. It transforms unguided aerial munitions into ""smart bombs."" In sets of similar equipment (Joint Direct Attack Munition, JDAM) - global positioning devices to improve the accuracy of the defeat. They can be attached to various types of weapons. Including ground-based. If it is a miracle, it will not help evil to overcome good. It will only delay the torment. Andriy Marochko, an officer of the LPR NM, reported on the increased activity of Ukrainian saboteurs on the territory of the republic. According to him, the saboteurs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine operate in groups of 10-12 people. Marochko said: ""The main task of the saboteurs is to open our positions, determine the accumulation of weapons and equipment, as well as adjust artillery fire."" They're trying, and we're testing them. Here are the weirdos. The ending is known. Jarosław Szymczyk, the chief commandant of the Polish police, was injured in the explosion of one of the gifts he received during a visit to Ukraine. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Poland reported that the incident occurred in a room next to Szymczyk's office: ""One of the gifts that the commandant received during a working visit to Ukraine on December 11-12 of this year, where he met with the leadership of the police and the Emergency Service of Ukraine, exploded."" According to representatives of the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs, the gift was received from ""one of the heads of Ukrainian services."" During the explosion, Szymczyk received minor injuries. A civilian member of the General Directorate of the National Police was also injured. Yes, this happens in Kiev. But Warsaw does not attach too much importance to this. In an interview with The Economist, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was forced to admit that Russian partial mobilization made it possible to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the area of Kremennaya and Svatovo. Valery Zaluzhny said: ""Russian mobilization has worked."" Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky reluctantly agreed that Russia has a very great potential in terms of human resources. Gentlemen officers, maybe you should take your feet off after that. The head of the office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak opened up in an interview with the Economist magazine: ""The opinion of a number of Western politicians that sitting down at the negotiating table is the first thing to do before peace reigns in Ukraine is a fundamental mistake ..."" According to Zelensky's right-hand man, calling for negotiations between Moscow and Kiev before ""Russia recognizes Ukraine's very right to exist as a sovereign state"" is ""ridiculous."" Yermak said that before the parties sit down at the negotiating table, a number of conditions must be met. Including, ensuring the energy, food, nuclear, environmental safety of the independent country. Yes, there is a method of self-hypnosis, but it does not always work. LISTEN AS WELL.

The Motherland is the Motherland. - You visit Kaluga. -Of course. My mother lived there, I often visited her, even when I worked in Ukraine. Now my sister is there. I definitely visit the graves - all my loved ones are there. - Your career in Kiev was hindered by the fact that you come from Russia, studied in Moscow. - Up to a point, no. But when I had already reached a high level, I broke through: ""Moskal, pulls us into the ""Taiga Union"" (as the Customs Union was called by its opponents in Ukraine. - Ed.). I was often reproached for speaking Russian. I considered it extremely important that the Russian people hear the Russian speech from the head of the government. Even in the western regions, I tried to speak Russian, emphasizing the bilingualism of the country. - Why didn't you make Russian the second state language in Ukraine. - We managed to adopt the law ""On Regional Languages"". It allowed the Russian to be equal in regions where Russians made up a significant portion of the population. And what is characteristic - after the coup d'état, the first thing the putschists canceled was this law. - How you were received in the west of Ukraine. - I had a case back during the presidency of Kuchma (Azarov was then the first deputy prime minister. - Ed.). He sent me to the Lviv region and said (and Kuchma himself did not speak Ukrainian very well): ""Mykola, you need to learn the text for 3 - 4 minutes, otherwise you can get there ..."" I say, ""It would be right if I start my speech by removing 3 to 4 people from their jobs."" I know the psychology of Westerners well. They respect strength. If they feel that a person has arrived who can make a decision, they no longer dare to shout something there. - Now this psychology has changed. -Absolutely not. They have been in the service of hundreds of years - from the Austrians, the Poles. They have that kind of psychology. And if they see that they have more power, they begin to persecute, humiliate other people. That's what we're seeing now. - Yanukovych, under whom you worked as prime minister, was quite neutral until 2013. But suddenly, everyone was going to sign an association with the European Union. Why all of a sudden. - When we came to power, we began to deal with cases. And we inherited from the previous administration a package of documents on preparation for the association with the EU. Most of the work has already been done. Plus, they needed cheap money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And it was a trap. We understood that our main market is Russia and the countries of the former USSR. But on the other hand, we need money and technology. Where can I get them? We decided that in the West. - And you went to the West. - Not either. There we were required to switch to European standards. And that meant rebuilding the entire industry. You can't do that in a year or two. And the butting began. - And what about Russia. - Russia told us: ""Choose. But Ukraine will not be a transit zone where Western goods go in a direct course, local stickers are slapped on them and taken to Russia without any duties."" We're in a stalemate. Therefore, they wanted to postpone the signing of the association agreement with the EU until ""we reach an agreement."" Relations with Europe and America immediately became strained. And Russia and China have offered agreements worth billions of dollars. - And then the Maidan broke out. - This was taken advantage of, of course, by the American special services. They decided that this was an opportunity, and launched a coup scenario. What was the main slogan on the Maidan? The girl there was standing with a poster: ""I don't want the Taiga Union, I want the European Union and lace panties."" Well, this girl got the full program. - What was agreed with Russia then. - We have signed agreements on cheap gas. We have outlined a whole program for the production of a good aircraft based on the An-70, heavy missiles. It is now Russia that has created its own ""Sarmat"". And then all the heavy rockets were designed by the Dnepropetrovsk Yuzhmash. - If it were not for the Maidan, what kind of relations would Ukraine have with Russia. - Back in 2002, Putin, Nazarbayev, Lukashenko and Kuchma launched the project of the Common Economic Space. The four freedoms are the movement of goods, labour, capital and services. In fact, this was the Customs Union. - But not the new USSR. - What is the Soviet Union? It's a common market. No customs, uniform standards. - It's the same in the EU. - They've come to this. And we, on the contrary, fell apart. Who benefited from this? We all lost. And so we started working to get back. But while maintaining political independence. And then it began... - From whose side. - Our Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Justice tried especially hard. There were mostly Westerners. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hired only those who knew the Ukrainian language. God knows what kind of special, if only he would be a joke on the move. And the creation of the Common Economic Space was very closely monitored by the Americans. To them, this treaty was like a knife under the heart. And they torpedoed it with the first Maidan, Yushchenko's Orange Revolution. The same thing happened again on the second Maidan. - If in 2014 the Maidan had not won, and Azarov had remained the Prime Minister of Ukraine, what would it be now. - We had a program to activate the economy through technological industries. I have already said everywhere that Ukraine will not go far on one grain. - That is, the bet was on technology. -Yes. And there would be stability. When I was prime minister - for 1 dollar they gave 8 hryvnia (now 37 hryvnia for $ 1. - Ed.). Palyanitsa - this is the main bread in Kiev - cost 1 hryvnia 58 kopecks. So, what would Ukraine be like? Prosperous. The incomes of the population for 10 years, according to our plan, should have grown by 2.5 times (as a result, by 2020, compared to 2013, the per capita incomes of Ukrainians in terms of currency decreased by a quarter. - Ed.. - What are the options and chances for Ukraine now. - A chance will appear if you change the leadership. Well, you can not go further with these adventurers, puppets. With them, the country cannot but develop - it cannot exist. Here is Viktor Orban (Prime Minister of Hungary. - Ed.),  one of the independent European politicians said about Zelensky: ""You have to be an idiot to get into a conflict with a major nuclear power!"" With this leadership, Ukraine has no future. - And how it will actually be. - Ukraine is not an independent player now. Who makes decisions for her? Leaders of Russia and the United States. The answer to your question depends on them. - Is someone calling you from Ukraine? Colleagues, acquaintances. -Of course. Only we communicate in a complex way. Ukraine is under the hood. Back in my day, Americans were eavesdropping on everyone there. And now everything there is just under their full control. - Ukrainian propaganda tells us that everyone there is united in hatred of Russia. - Well, there isn't one. There are a lot of people with whom you can work. - You maintain relations with Yanukovych. - Congratulations to each other on holidays, on birthdays. By phone. I don't want to idealize him, but he wasn't who he's portrayed to be. - In Ukraine, you started your career in Donbass. Do you want to go back there. - I'd love to. But an interesting situation: even the first leaders of Donbass made a list of people whose arrival is undesirable. - And you're on that list. -Yes. I was upset... The time will come, I will definitely come there. LISTEN AS WELL. Will the fourth offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine take place?"

And Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny asks for tanks and lies.",Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have the resources for new major operations,"Zelensky demands from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine General Zaluzhny not to leave Artemovsk (Bakhmut). Leaving a ruined city before the New Year will negatively affect its rating. He does not think about how many Ukrainians will die there. He, in general, refused to answer the question of Western journalists about how much he is ready to lose Ukrainians before the end of the conflict with Russia. He just snapped back: ""Did we have to say, 'Take all our stuff, and we're going to go to Poland?' ""Many have left, but most in the country have stayed."" But against the freezing of the conflict, which has been hinted to Kiev from the West for more than a week, not only Zelensky himself, but also many representatives of the military-power bloc. Defense Minister Reznikov in a comment to Newsweek said that he was waiting for the offensive of Ukrainian troops as soon as the ground froze. - My personal assessment is as follows: our armed forces do not plan to stop. Our stocks of winter equipment are three times higher than the critical level. We just need to wait for the land to become less damp,"" Reznikov said. He was supported by the Deputy Head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexei Gromov in terms of abandoning the New Year's truce. Threatening statements that should support the morale in the Ukrainian army and show the West that Ukraine ""does not surrender to the enemy"", and therefore it needs more money, more weapons. And here, as if by order, in the British magazine The Economist there is a large interview with the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny. The general gave it, as indicated, as early as December 3, but it was published on the website of the publication only on the 15th. However, during these almost two weeks, no fundamental changes in the situation have occurred. And in it, the general, among all his complaints, confirms Reznikov's information that we should wait for an attempt at a Ukrainian offensive as soon as the ground freezes. - With such resources, I cannot conduct new major operations, although we are working on one right now. It's on the way, but you don't see it yet,"" Zaluzhny indirectly confirmed Reznikov's promises. It is clear that we are not talking about local attempts to recapture positions, but about something more. And our side will take this information into account, or rather, for sure, has already taken it into account. Although he sees his main task not in the offensive, to which zelensky's team is forcing him together with the president of (so far) Ukraine: ""The problem we face is, first of all, to keep this line and not to give up positions anymore. This is extremely important. Because I know that releasing it is ten to 15 times harder than not giving it up. So our task now is to hold out. Our task is to very clearly monitor with the help of our partners what is happening there, where they are preparing. This is our strategic task."" According to the priority, Zaluzhny sets the strategic tasks facing him as follows: 1 - holding lines and positions, 2 - accumulating resources for a future campaign that may begin in late January-February-early March, 3 - missile defense and air defense: ""In my personal opinion, I am not an expert in the field of energy, but it seems to me that we are on the verge. We're balancing on a fine line..."" About the fact that energy is of great importance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from logistics and the delivery of ammunition to the restoration of damaged military equipment - Zaluzhny delicately remains silent. In general, Zaluzhny's conversation leaves some squeamish aftertaste. And not because he complains all the time about the lack of this, the other, the third. Although in this he is a master. ""We need tanks, we need armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles. And we need ammunition,"" he addresses in his interview to the West, and adjusts requests towards reality. - Please note, I'm not talking about the F-16. - We already have several NASAMS [Norwegian-American air defense systems]. The IRIS-T [German air defense system] is already in use. A little. They just need to be strengthened. We need dozens of those, asks in another episode of the conversation. ""I need 300 tanks, 600-700 IFVs, 500 howitzers,"" he addresses with specific requirements, as if begging for an answer: ""You have all this, and even more, already had. So what?. In general, all those variations on the same old theme ""Give, give, give"". Or, as it was sung in one popular song a hundred years ago: ""At the Kursky railway station I stand young. Give Christ for the sake of a golden chervonk."" And it all looks quite normal. But as for feelings of squeamishness, it immediately arises as soon as General Zaluzhny begins to compare Russian troops and the Ukrainian army. And for him, the Russians, everything supposedly rests on the strength of Surovikin: ""You look at him and realize that either you are completing the task, or you .... (the ending is the literary equivalent)"". But in the Ukrainian army, the main thing is ""to be normal. Being normal means being human in any situation – that's the most important thing. To remain human in order to become a leader. To be smarter, to be stronger, to be more talented and in this case to try to control people."" And is it not the Ukrainians who shoot civilians even in the settlements ""liberated"" by them, not the Ukrainians who hung posters everywhere with calls to ""surrender traitors and collaborators by calling the SBU"", not the Ukrainians ""from all guns"" work with artillery on the territories of peaceful quarters of the cities of Donbass? According to him, the Russians are ""looking for ways to stop the fighting and get a pause by any means."" Then why does the general's main question – to hold the lines if the Russians want to ""stop fighting""? Does not answer and will not answer. And this, of course, is the ""dastardly Russians"" who have withdrew such a distance that it is impossible to get them out of the Highmars MLRS, as the general claims. Perhaps that is why the Armed Forces of Ukraine from these American MLRS loop both day and night at completely peaceful objects? The general has a strange logic, to put it mildly - from the regimental mortar you can get the ""sworn Moskals"" and from the long-range MLRS ""Highmars"" to cover the same ""Moskals"" does not work. Maybe we should take them away from the front line in this case.

Rich, poor, old and young, all in the same trench. True, some near Maryinka and in Artemovsk (Bakhmut) lay down lives, while others worry about them in Paris. But everyone in a single impulse rebuffs. From the president with his family (where he even has a nine-year-old son employed as an adviser in the supply of Western weapons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine) to the last homeless man on the bench. Olena Zelenskaya, the wife of Ukrainian President Voldemar, was here in Paris. She went on an important international business - to help the Christmas tree to dress up the Macron couple in the Elysee Palace. And what, it is warm, dry, there is water, the light is not cut off. It is a sin not to come to such good people and not help them solve the most pressing issues. Moreover, after such pathetic statements that Olena made in November, that all Ukrainians, again, like one Zelensky, are ready to endure a year, two, and three, and how much there, in general, it will be necessary to live without light, heat and water, if only to someday enter the bright future of the European Union with heating, electricity and sewerage. And that all this was in the Ukrainians themselves, it does not count. After that, Madame Zelenskaya even spoke in Paris at some forum and asked to send Ukraine more diesel and gasoline generators to Ukrainians as a gift under the Christmas tree. But it had no success and, unlike her husband, who at one time performed the number of the original piano performance immortal in marginal layers, did not even receive applause from the audience. Probably, Olena was very upset because she could not organize the delivery of generators to Ukraine for free. And what does a girl do in Paris, where there are so many fashion boutiques and shops? Especially when she's upset. That's right, she goes to ""shop"". Well, Olena was very upset. Shopping was unusual. For 40 thousand dollars, as written by European newspapers. Translated into rubles, this is a little more than 2.5 million rubles. It's strange, of course, that it's not on the euro, but they can see better there. It could have been more, but there was no time to linger, there are difficult times in Ukraine now, it was necessary to urgently return in order to ""overcome hardships and deprivations"" together with the people. Although, who knows, suddenly she is sick with this shopping, as they say now, a shopaholic. Then, especially, she needed to urgently be treated in that situation. No, of course, Olena also helped the Ukrainians. The network even has a photo of the cheapest vermicelli in a stylish package from ""Louis Viton"" with a sheet of paper pinned to it with the message that this is a ""gift"" from the Olena Zelenskaya Foundation. Take it, do not deny yourself anything, and the bag will still be able to fold the rags, or take out the waste products in it when the sewer collapses. The right thing in the household will come in handy. No, maybe you wanted her to buy generators for at least the same 40,000 bucks? And the mood after encountering an indifferent world in her is so bad and remains, so whatever. Callous, indifferent people. Olena will still think about whether to take such with her to the EU.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4694395/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-18,"The latest news about the situation on and around Ukraine on December 18, 2022: the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing an assassination attempt on Valery Gerasimov, and Zelensky tried to deceive the West with money","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 18, 2022","In the cities of Ukraine, they began to put Christmas trees on the squares. In Kiev this year, the main decoration of the city was a 12-meter artificial beauty, which was dressed in the colors of the Ukrainian flag with garlands of dark blue and yellow. Of course, compared to last year's natural 31-meter forest beauty, the current one looks pale. Moreover, the backlight, which is powered by the generator, will not be supplied all the time, but at certain hours. The top of the Christmas tree was decorated with the coat of arms of Ukraine, and at the bottom were placed the flags of countries that help Kiev. However, in comparison with the Christmas tree in Nikolaev, the capital's spruce can be considered a masterpiece. The authorities of Nikolaev simply threw a camouflage net on the monument to St. Nicholas and called the resulting structure a Christmas tree. True, the townspeople of Nikolaev themselves considered that the design is more like a giant sloppy pile of garbage than a Christmas tree. A stunning discovery was made by residents of the village of Kochanivka, Okhtyrka district, Sumy region. Going through the water to the local well, they were very surprised when, scooping up from the well, they pulled up a bucket with ... Oil. Conscious citizens signaled to the environmental inspectorate, and the experts who arrived confirmed the presence in the well of a ""viscous liquid of dark color with the smell of oil."" Further results will be known from the results of laboratory tests. Most likely, we are talking about the breakthrough of any pipeline, which was laid nearby. It is possible that some illegal tie-in has leaked. In the meantime, the villagers are scratching their heads over another problem - where to get water for drinking and household needs. Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz once again said that Germany will not unilaterally provide Ukraine with modern Western tanks that are in service with the Bundeswehr. - We adhere to three clear principles. First, we support Ukraine to the best of our ability. Second, we prevent a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. And thirdly, there will be no unilateral action on the part of Germany,"" Scholz announced. In general, ""such a cow is needed by yourself."" Well, Olaf, now expect new insults from Kiev from Andriy Melnyk, who left there. However, in Berlin, he was replaced as ambassador of Ukraine by no less rude. According to the well-known American newspaper Washington Post, Zelensky's team, without advertising its initiatives in the public space, proposed that Western governments finance direct cash payments to Ukrainian citizens. It was about $50 per person per month. According to Kiev's calculations, such financing of the population of Ukraine would cost the West $ 12 billion in six months. As the sources told WP in surprise, for a reason unknown to them, the initiative for some reason ""met with a cold reception from Western officials."" About the same as Bankova's proposal to FIFA that Zelensky make a video appeal before the final match of the World Cup, which ends in Qatar. I wonder why. Even more interestingly, even here, Zelensky and his advisers tried to deceive the West. A simple calculation shows that they provided data on the residence of 40 million people in Ukraine. Although the real population is now unlikely to be much more than half of this figure. Hardly anyone thinks that Zelensky will pay Ukrainians twice as much as promised, and then it turns out that someone wanted to pocket half of the amount. The influential American newspaper The New York Times reported that Washington failed to prevent Kiev's assassination attempt on the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov. When the Americans became aware of Gerasimov's impending visit to the zone of the Special Military Operation, they did not share this information with the Ukrainian side. But Kiev still learned about Gerasimov's plans. And then Washington began to dissuade the Ukrainian leadership from an assassination attempt on it in order to prevent the possibility of a WAR between the United States and Russia. ""We told them not to do that,"" a senior U.S. official told reporters. We said, ""Hey, that's too much."" But in response, the Ukrainian military informed the Americans that they had already launched an attack on the alleged location of the general. Gerasimov was not there, but U.S. officials said several Russians were killed in the strike. According to the Estonian National Broadcasting, thousands of people are dismissed every month in the republic. And, although general unemployment is growing by about 1% per month, it would seem, not such large numbers, this process has acquired the character of a progressive movement. - For people who have been reduced, this is a great loss. And in this one percent, about 6,000-7,000 people. Previously, it was about hundreds of people a month, - said the economist of Eesti Pank and added that those who work with people and companies from Russia are the first to fall under the reduction, since the main reasons for this process are the growing costs of companies and sanctions against Moscow. Ukrainian civilian doctors face a surge in unemployment. This was told by the head of the public organization ""Social Movement"" Vitaly Dudin, who announced the planned ""personnel optimization"". The reason is a decrease in funding. ""Thousands of doctors are under threat of layoffs,"" Dudin predicts. - Chief doctors claim that even salaries will not have enough money. - The budget for medicine is not increasing, but inflation is growing. Therefore, there will be not only reductions, there is a risk of ""bankruptcies"" of many clinics. Even relatively prosperous medical institutions now survive at the expense of humanitarian aid, what the state gives is barely enough to maintain current expenses and salaries. — explained the mechanism of what is happening deputy head of the board of the All-Ukrainian Medical Society Konstantin Nadutyi. And this is in conditions when the hospitals of Ukraine are full of wounded, and not only civilian hospitals, but also institutions of a completely different orientation are being repurposed for them. - The Swiss authorities said that the country on its own initiative joins the new EU sanctions against Russia. It seems that the Swiss have awakened an appetite for Russian assets abroad. - As part of the new EU sanctions, even toy drones are banned from supplying Russia. And they forgot about children's railways. - Ukrainian intelligence said that the next Russian strikes on the energy sector of Ukraine could be timed to coincide with UN meetings or days of the week. That's a perfectly accurate prediction. The next missile strike will necessarily be on some day of the week. Don't go to grandma. - The chief judge of the Supreme Court of Norway reported that his wife, whom he brought from Ukraine, tried to poison him. His wife Natalia (26 years younger than her husband) justified herself by the fact that it was her revenge for the fact that her husband supported Russia and Putin. As if he hadn't been sued. - The press service of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club reported that next year the grain harvest in Ukraine will decrease by 60% compared to 2021. - Informed sources report that part of the Western financial ""assistance"" (for the most part, loans) is spent on ""salaries and bonuses"" to Western mercenaries who ""receive such money that it does not add sympathy to them from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Command happiness, for one minute decides victory,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who has not lost a single battle. And he also taught: ""Pushing back the enemy is a failure. Cut off, surrounded, scattered – good luck."" DID NOT ALLOW THE LOSS OF CONTROL. Colonel Alexander SAVENKO. ""In the conditions of dense fire from small arms of nationalists on the positions of the Russian battalion tactical group in the area of one of the settlements, Colonel Alexander Savenkov organized the installation of a repeater on the roof of one of the buildings in the area of the observation post. With his non-standard and decisive actions, the officer provided kp officials with stable jamming-protected radio communication with subordinate units. A few days later, in the vicinity of another settlement, Ukrainian militants attempted a counteroffensive, which was accompanied by massive mortar shelling of the defensive lines of our troops. As a result of a mortar shell exploding near the hardware, the main communication system failed. Thanks to brave and decisive actions, as well as professional practical skills, Savenkov personally and in the shortest possible time organized communication with the higher CP on backup means of communication, while despite the continuing shelling, without leaving the combat post, he continued to provide communication with the higher command, which made it possible to prevent loss of control and repel the enemy attack. Also, as a result of another mortar attack, in conditions of poor visibility, Colonel Savenkov found two servicemen who received numerous shrapnel wounds, despite the incessant shelling, he personally pulled the wounded out of the fire, took them to a safe shelter and provided first aid. Through immediate, courageous and decisive action, the officer saved their lives. When organizing communications in new positions, the officer organized the planning and deployment of communication lines in the shortest possible time, which increased the stability of control. During the installation of repeaters, the enemy subjected the area of deployment to shelling from the MIRS ""Heimars"". Despite the shelling, being under continuous enemy fire, risking his life, showing courage and bravery, as a result of the shelling he was seriously wounded by shrapnel, but fulfilled the task, did not allow loss of control, which made it possible to repel the enemy's offensive. "" HE TOOK THE EQUIPMENT OUT OF THE SHELLING. Sergeant Fyodor RYBALO. ""The deputy commander of the platoon, Sergeant Fedor Rybalov, in the area of one of the settlements, was carrying out a combat mission to evacuate weapons and military equipment damaged during the battles with Ukrainian nationalists. At the time of the beginning of the evacuation, the enemy subjected the area of accumulation of equipment to artillery fire. Having assessed the situation, despite the threat to life, Sergeant Fyodor Rybalov decided, together with his subordinates, to continue to evacuate the weapons and military equipment entrusted to him. Skillfully maneuvering in a limited area, thanks to the coordinated actions of sergeant Rybalov's unit, the Russian servicemen managed to quickly withdraw the evacuated equipment from the firing zone without losses. At the same time, there were also no losses on the part of Fedor's subordinates."" FOIL THE ATTACK, DID NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SURROUNDED. Junior Sergeant Denis IVANO. ""The unit under the command of Junior Sergeant Denis Ivanov performed a combat mission as part of a company tactical group to search for saboteurs in a forest belt located in one of the tactical directions. Moving to the specified place, Denis, together with his subordinates, discovered a minefield on the approaches to the forest belt. Having bypassed the minefields from the flank, and moving along the forest belt, Denis saw a large number of military equipment and personnel preparing an attack on the area controlled by our servicemen. Having assessed the situation and quickly orienting himself in a difficult situation, Denis reported to the command post about the upcoming massive offensive, after which he entrenched himself on this line and organized a defense. The nationalists began to advance towards our positions when they were suddenly attacked by Denis Ivanov's unit. Despite the unequal battle, our servicemen under the command of Denis Ivanov for several hours did not allow the enemy to develop the offensive, shackling his forces. Having withstood repeated enemy attacks, Denis and his Marines ensured the retention of an important defensive line until reinforcements arrived. Thanks to the courage and dedication of Junior Sergeant Denis Ivanov, as well as the bravery and coherence of the actions of his subordinates, the Marines, despite repeated attempts by the militants to take them into the ring, managed to survive, causing significant damage to the advancing enemy forces, which forced him to retreat to the initial lines.

The interview is also quite frank. Because some harsh, even cruel - beyond the limits of human humanism phrases, which are sometimes capable of the military, but not politicians or diplomats, are not censored by the editors of the British magazine. It turns out that such phrases for the British and Western society in general become acceptable. Or even desirable?. How do you like such a confession of General Zaluzhny. - For us, the military, it all began in 2014. Eight years of struggle until 2022... Everything that happened on February 24 was an increase in scale. Before that, we had a front of 403 kilometers. And on February 24, this front grew to 2500 kilometers... All we've done is apply our knowledge and experience that we've had since. And the most important experience, which we professed almost as a religion, is that Russians and any other enemies should be killed, simply killed, and most importantly, not be afraid to do it. And that's what we're doing. It's just curious, and if Zaluzhny instead of ""kill Russians"" said ""kill Jews"" or ""kill negroes"" - the British just as calmly printed it. Further, Zaluzhny admits that ""since the beginning of the conflict, he has already dismissed ten Ukrainian generals, another shot himself .. The commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says that russian troops correctly planned the start of the special operation, but they had limited resources. ""I think they had the resources for three months to achieve their goals,"" Zaluzhny said. - They wanted to take Kiev. Militarily, it was the right decision — the easiest way to achieve your goal. I would do the same. About today's battles and the alignment of forces, the Ukrainian military leader says this. - The situation in Donbas is not easy... They (Russian troops) need time to gather resources and build new capabilities to continue to achieve their goals. But they are working on another task in parallel, doing everything possible to prevent us from regrouping and striking. They are shackling our troops to prevent us from regrouping. The fact that they are now fighting hard is, of course, very bad. This exhausts the armed forces of Ukraine. About the tactics and condition of the Ukrainian troops, Zaluzhny says even more striking things. He openly admits that he is throwing soldiers to slaughter, does not now provide assistance to those who are still holding back the Russian offensive in the Donbas. And at the same time, he is preparing fresh reserves for his future offensive in February. Just read that. - The next task that we have is to hold the line and not lose ground anymore. Because it is ten to fifteen times harder to release than not to surrender. Our troops are bleeding right now. But, forgive me soldiers in the trenches, it is now more important to focus on accumulating resources for the longer and heavier fighting that could begin next year. Our second strategic task is to prepare for the development of the conflict that may occur in February. To be able to fight with fresh forces and reserves. This can happen in February, at best in March, at worst in late January. A British magazine asks Zaluzhny about the ""offensive on Crimea"", which is promised in Kiev. And he responds, actually revealing the probable plan to capture Melitopol, that to take the Crimea in a fire blockade. ""To get to the borders of Crimea, today we need to cover a distance of 84 km to Melitopol,"" says the Ukrainian general. - By the way, this is enough for us, because Melitopol would give us full fire control of the land corridor (to crimea), because from Melitopol we can already fire on the Crimean Isthmus, the same HIMARS and so on. Surely these Napoleonic plans are known to the Russian General Staff and it knows how to disrupt them. Otherwise, the Ukrainian general would not have blurted them out so easily to journalists. Zaluzhny also admits that Ukraine's energy system is balancing ""on a fine line."" - I'm not an expert on energy, but it seems to me that we are on the verge. We're balancing on a fine line. And if (the power grid) is destroyed... Without water, light and heat, can we talk about the preparation of reserves for the continuation of hostilities. The Ukrainian commander tells a British magazine that he has ""enough people, I have enough. I don't need hundreds of thousands more."" But Zaluzhny asks for weapons and equipment: ""We need tanks, we need APCs, BMPs. And we need ammunition. I'm not talking about the F-16."" He also asks for air defense, recognizing that NATO makes all the calculations for the Ukrainians: ""NATO specialists know everything, absolutely everything, down to the smallest detail. The calculations are done. We already have several NASAMS (Norwegian-American air defense systems). IRIS-T (German air defense system) is already in use. But we need dozens of those."" The general is asked: ""Have Russian troops adapted to HIMARS (American multiple rocket launchers)."" ""Yes,"" Zaluzhny replies. -They've gone a distance unattainable for HIMARS. And we don't have anything long-range. There were also complaints about the greed of the West. Judging by his words, Zaluzhny wants to fan a conflict in Europe on the scale of the First World War. And the West from such a prospect ""faints"". - We are talking about the scale of the First World War. This is what Anthony Radakin (the commander of the British troops) said to me,"" Zaluzhny flaunts. ""But when I told him that the British army had fired a million shells in the First World War, and so far only 50,000 had been sent to us, he replied: 'We will lose Europe. We won't have anything to live on if you fire so many shells."" When people talk about 50,000 shells, people counting money faint. But with such resources, I cannot conduct new large operations, although we are now working on one, - Zaluzhny mysteriously intrigues. - It's on the way, but you can't see it yet. I need resources. I need 300 tanks, 600-700 IFVs, 500 howitzers, - the general gives specific figures and promises, if he is given all this, ""to reach the borders on February 23."" - But I get less than I need. And we have to seize a lot more territory. Well, at the end, The Economist asked Zaluzhny what he thought about partial mobilization in Russia. ""The Russian mobilization has worked,"" the Ukrainian general is forced to admit. - It's not true that their problems are terrible, that these people won't fight. They will. They are a problem for us. LISTEN AS WELL. Will the fourth offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine take place?"

Which was aimed at key Ukrainian energy security facilities. It is those that are directly involved in the movement of trains with equipment on the railways, and in the supply of electricity to factories. Those who are trying to restore the defeated both Ukrainian and Western armored vehicles knocked out in the battles in the Donbas, as well as in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions.According to various sources, a total of 60 to 100 high-precision missiles, as well as kamikaze drones of the Geranium type, were fired at energy facilities on the territory of the independent state on December 15. Ukrainian facilities were covered by two morning waves. Judging by the video footage from Kiev and the Kiev region, which appeared in social networks, police crews moved through the streets of the Ukrainian capital in the morning, who through loudspeakers called on fellow citizens to immediately leave the houses built under the Soviet Union and quickly take refuge in bomb shelters (built also in the Soviet era). Hide not from Russian missiles – from falling fragments of missiles of Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems. The mayor of the capital Vitali Klitschko in his telegram channel reported that, according to Kiev rescuers, explosions on Friday were noted in the Desnyansky, Dnipropetrovsk and Holosiiv districts of the capital. And he stressed that the case smells like kerosene. KP.RU asked military expert, retired Colonel Mykhailo Tymoshenko, for a comment. - Well, as reported, Ukrainian railways came to the kayuk. -No. 70% of roads are electrified in Ukraine. And 30% of the roads are machine-driven. Diesels go. - There are a lot of them. - A long time ago, after we began to knock out their traction substations, they began to pull up these diesel engines, removing them from non-electrified roads. To transport troops to the east, these spare diesel locomotives are actively used right now. And we don't know the number of diesel locomotives that Ukrainians use. - That is, these strikes did not interrupt the supply of Ukrainian troops by rail. - Unfortunately, no. In terms of the density of railways, Ukraine was the richest of all the Union republics of the USSR. Both in density and in length. And they have no problem moving from one road to another. If there's a craving. - And bridges. - Well, if they have more than 20 undamaged bridges across the Dnieper, so what do we want. - And the Soviet experience of rail warfare and countering it. - The experience was serious. If the station is a junction or a first-class station , there are backup diesel engines with electric generators. And you still have an energy management system. Let's say we knocked out a station that provided energy to a power plant that provided a road. Well, they can switch to wand control. Arrows are translated manually. Semaphores to manage. If they have the opportunity. I can crawl. - So we didn't cut off their oxygen. - Not yet. - On Friday, the blow fell on six regions - again they hit CHP and TPPs. - Thermal power plants - they feed the looped power grid. Dispatchers direct energy to the affected region. They're all relatively small. Everything is compact. - That is, the strikes of hundreds of missiles are almost in vain. - The railroad is a tenacious creature. And knocking bridges out is hard. If the bridge is steel, it is a lattice calculated with a margin. And you have to hit the grate exactly. Or, better, to the top of the support, to the rink on which the grate rests. But here sniper accuracy is needed. - We should have destroyed these two dozen bridges across the Dnieper a long time ago. - To destroy these bridges you need a hell of a rocket gap. - That's also why we didn't blow them up. - Including. As an example - the bridge in Odessa across the toka. It was hit more than 10 times. It is now working on a limited load. Well, you knocked out the rail and sleeper grate in some place. A track repair train arrives. And after 6-12 hours, it closes your funnel. He puts down the rails and the trains go. - That is, their destruction is Sisyphean labor. - Yes, as with traction substations. If you knock out the craving - it should be restored after 4 hours. This is if the distribution site is destroyed at these substations. And if the transformer is knocked out, it must be changed. - There is something to change. - They had a transformer factory in Zaporozhye. And when the reserve ran out, they began to beg Europe. In general, the center element is a transformer. Also, when you hit the TPP, it is best to get to the turbine or transformer shop. And if they get into distribution, high-voltage platforms - well, horseradish with them. Within 12 hours it will be restored. The maximum is a day. READ ALSO.

Moreover, not only capital buildings were destroyed, but also small crossings across tiny rivers, of which there are many in the Donbass. While such destruction is only a relative inconvenience for military equipment, it is not easy for the civilian population. How to take a detour through the mud food, passengers and just get to work. Therefore, the DPR government pays special attention to the restoration of bridges. ""The opening of traffic on bridges will not only help residents shorten the path, but will also allow faster delivery to the liberated territories of materials and equipment necessary for the construction of houses, schools and hospitals,"" said DPR Prime Minister Vitaly Khotsenko. In particular, at the end of November, work on the restoration of the bridge across the Kalmius River in the village of Staromaryevka on the highway of national importance Volnovakha - Telmanovo reached the final stage. According to Vitaly Khotsenko, the builders dismantled the destroyed structures, carried out work on the installation of a temporary bridge, laying a monolithic overhead slab, repairing supports, reinforcing and concreting. By the end of the year, this transport crossing and 5 more bridges in the republic will be put into operation. Among them is a bridge in The Lower Krynka. It is located in the protection zone of the Khanzhonkovsky reservoir and is a link between the cities of Donetsk, Makiivka, Khartsyzsk, Yenakiieve and nearby villages. Now the bridge is being built according to all the rules and regulations of the Russian Federation. It is planned to complete the work by the end of this year. - Our task is to open traffic for road transport as soon as possible. There is technology, people. The head of the republic, Denis Pushilin, came and promised to resolve the issue with crushed stone. We will cope, - an employee of the contractor organization on the construction of the bridge Sergey Novikov told Komsomolka. Two automobile bridges in the Novoazovsky district are also being restored. They will be put into operation in the spring of 2023 and will help in the restoration of Mariupol. According to Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Marat Khusnullin, a total of 500 kilometers of roads will be repaired in new territories this year. To speed up the work, mobile asphalt concrete plants brought from Russia are used. One of the most important projects is the reconstruction and expansion of the Novoazovsk-Mariupol road with a length of 44 km. It is the main supply artery of Mariupol. By the way, gas stations are being built and repaired along the reconstructed roads. There are now 337 gas stations in the DPR, another 9 are planned to be put into operation before the end of the year and 15 gas stations are under repair."

The acting head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin also took part in the landmark event. ""The 125th anniversary of the Yenakiieve Metallurgical Plant testifies to how deep the roots of the enterprise and the city are,"" says the head of the region. - But the most important asset of this enterprise at all times, of course, were people. For more than a century of history, the Yenakiieve Plant has gone through many tests, but the team coped with everything. During the Great Patriotic War, the enterprise was taken to the Urals, but after the complete liberation of the city, after 100 days, the first smelting took place at the plant. The last eight years have also been difficult for Yenakiieve Steel, during which hostilities continue in the republic, but, despite all today's difficulties, the enterprise is working, developing and preserving traditions. The manager of the plant, Alexander Kovalenko, said that for all the time of its existence, the plant produced 160 million tons of pig iron. - We calculated that if all this cast iron is turned into railway rails, then this way you can twist the globe more than two and a half times. And if you turn all this into a building profile, then you can lay a line from the Moon to the Earth 40 times! He said. It is difficult to imagine what physical efforts had to be made to produce such an amount, such a river of metal. Among the current employees of Yenakiieve Steel, there are many who have devoted more than one decade to their native plant, many who represent not the first generation of metallurgists devoted to the Yenakiieve enterprise. - A lot of generations have worked and are working here. We hope that our metallurgy will prosper, - says Alexey Velmozhin, deputy head of the blast furnace shop. - There is such a film ""Man of Steel"", all our people are made of steel, with a chic character, with a good attitude, with patriotism for their enterprise, for their city and for their republic. There were no metallurgists in the family of Alexander Titov, he is the first in the family who decided to connect his life with this sphere and has been working for Yenakiieve Steel for 16 years. Now Alexander is a master of production of the blast furnace shop, engaged in hot areas of work. ""Despite the fact that there were no metallurgists in my family, my father was a miner, my mother was a trade worker, I was very attracted to blast furnace production,"" says Alexander. - When I came to the enterprise, I was trained by the driver of the weighing car Sergey Golovko. He was my teacher and mentor, a very competent specialist, now he is on a well-deserved rest. There are also those who no longer work, but do not forget the working family. Among them is the former head of the blast furnace shop with 29 years of management experience Alexander Kuznetsov, he is an honored metallurgist, laureate of the State Prize. ""In every spark of cast iron that we will see is the work, patience and feat of all generations of the glorious labor collective of the plant,"" Kuznetsov said before the start of the anniversary smelting of pig iron. - We wish that cast iron will be poured at our plant for more than one hundred years. At the foundry yard of blast furnace No. 3, where the anniversary smelting took place, the watch was carried out by the master of the blast furnace Dmitry Zhuk, senior shift master Alexander Sharafanenko, gornovnye Evgeny Chikin, Ruslan Ruchkin, Alexander Rybachuk, Alexander Dragnysh, Alexander Galitsyn, Alexander Karpunin, Alexander Skiba and Andrey Nikiforenko. REFERENCE ""KP. Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works was founded in 1897 by the Russian-Belgian Metallurgical Society. One of the founders of the enterprise was a well-known engineer, merchant and industrialist Fedor Yenakiev, in whose honor the Donbass city was named. It was at Yenakiieve Steel that advanced technologies were introduced. Here, even in pre-revolutionary times, the largest blast furnace in Europe appeared, the first cast iron in Russia on mineral fuel was smelted here, and it was at this plant that the first Soviet sinter plant and filling machine were launched. To date, Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works remains one of the flagships of the Donbass industry, which has a full cycle of metallurgical production - from the production of agglomerate and cast iron to the manufacture of commercial cast and hot-rolled square billets, long products and wire rods. Yenakiieve Steel transferred to the management of the Southern Mining and Metallurgical Complex (SYMK) of the Russian investor Evgeny Yurchenko. The company is increasing its industrial capacity and developing, preserving centuries-old traditions."

Their capacities allow to ship five thousand tons of asphalt concrete mixture every day. ""It is important that the plants are mobile, they will move during the repair of other sections of the road,"" Yevgeny Balitsky emphasized. ""When working, technologies are used that give the coating a high margin of safety, which will allow you to do without repair for several years,"" the representative of the contractor added. The melitopol-Berdyansk highway will be given federal status. It will be repaired by the New Year.

Yes, the exercises are held according to legend, but the practice of actions by military doctors of the special purpose medical detachment during the exercises at the training grounds in the Republic of Belarus does not differ from the real ones. ""Wounded in the legs,"" you can hear from the trench. Fighters pull out a colleague according to all the rules. The task is to evacuate the wounded from the combat zone to safety.

On the street, he shows a generator that uninterruptedly provides the point with electricity. In the distance, the sounds of gunfire can be heard. Vitaly asks not to pay attention to them - on the front line this is the usual background. But most of all from their everyday life, fighters are proud of the bathhouse. - That's our beauty. Just look. There is a washing machine here - we wash, dry things. And here's the steam room. Here are the brooms hanging, the ceiling is insulated, the steam holds well. It's like a civilian. Warm, good and cozy, - summed up the tour mobilized. Aydin Zhamidulov was mobilized from the Orenburg region.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4695509/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-20,Zelensky accidentally admitted the terrible: Citizens of Ukraine became hostages of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,Zelensky in an interview admitted that the population of Ukraine does not make sense to let out of Kiev and other cities,"Remember the well-known slogan that, under Zelensky's predecessor as President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, became decisive in Kiev's attitude to the Donbass? I remind you, if anyone has forgotten: ""Donbass will be either Ukrainian or deserted."" Poroshenko's successor extended it to the whole of Ukraine. Of which he and his associates sincerely admit, completely ignoring the meaning of what they say. Let's start again with Donbass, about which the current Ukrainian authorities do not want to forget, dreaming of how they will conquer it and ""return"". Here is the head of the National Police Ihor Klymenko in an interview with RBC-Ukraine, who discusses how the ""liberation"" of Donbass will differ from the conquest of other lost territories. - There the children went to the second grade. Born in 14-15 years. People are poisoned by Russian propaganda. Large territories that have not heard the Ukrainian language for 8.5 years. In which hatred for everything Ukrainian, for Ukraine, was brought up and propagated. Therefore, the main problem is people, - Klymenko explained his position. "" We will all face the task of showing citizens who did not participate in illegal armed groups that our government is legitimate, real and really better. And the main thing is that this is the territory of our state - not of the Russian Federation, not of any ""union state"", but of Ukraine. - Therefore, I think that many people living there, perhaps, will go to look for the ""Russian world"" on the territory of the Russian Federation, he summed up, as always, which is characteristic of the current Ukrainian in power, lying. How could you not hear it. - We're going to have a job - they don't. We will have pensions - they do not. We will have the support of people - children and pensioners - but they do not. Our children will go to schools and kindergartens, and they will sit in basements. Because they don't know how to do anything! That's right, that's how we will win this war,"" Poroshenko promised on October 23, 2014, speaking at the Odessa Opera House. Now, thanks to Zelensky, children are sitting in basements all over Ukraine. But it doesn't bother him at all. People for him are just another defense of the territory under his control. ""Will Kiev be evacuated,"" a French journalist asked Zelensky, during which Zelensky said so many things that it was time to take him to a psychiatric hospital along with a microphone. But one revelation is knocked out even from his usual series of psychic deviations, and this is the answer to this question. - We'll stick with it. We don't have slavery, we have a democratic society. When people want to leave, they need to leave, they can afford it, and that's okay. Every person, defending the state, protects himself. The family is also part of the state. There are different examples, sometimes people need to leave, the state should give a corridor and opportunities for evacuation,"" Zelensky replied and continued. - But I want to say for sure that if the city is empty, it is very easy to capture, that's all. These are both historical and examples of our state. Let's leave aside his latest lies about a ""democratic society"" and ""when people want to leave, they can afford it."" For a month, students studying in foreign universities ask them to be released, but to no avail. So are the seafarers who have failed to meet their work contracts because they are not allowed out of the country. We will not pay attention to the fact that Kherson and Melitopol were not even empty at all when the Russian military came to them. Let's pay attention to zelensky's other words. ""If the city is empty, it is very easy to seize it,"" said the president of Ukraine (so far) and thereby signed that the ordinary population of his country, peaceful citizens are just hostages of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And that he perfectly understands the sparing nature of the actions of Russian troops, which are sparing for peaceful Ukrainians, who are trying not to strike at the ""peaceful"". And that is why he will not let anyone out of nowhere in order to complicate the task for Russia as much as possible. Because the Armed Forces of Ukraine will hide behind a ""human shield"" of the civilian population, like terrorists, which, in fact, they are. For Zelensky, the city is important, not the people. If earlier there was a slogan: ""Do not spare shells"", - now Zelensky has made his banner completely different: ""Do not regret the peaceful!. As in fact, for the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valery Zaluzhny, who asked Zelensky to sign a law on toughening penalties for the Ukrainian military. - A huge number of deserters, mass abandonment of combat positions, refusal to obey orders, - Zaluzhny listed the reasons why he supported the law ""On Strengthening Responsibility for the Military"" already adopted by the Verkhovna Rada. And all because the petition demanding that Zelensky veto this law gained not even 25 thousand votes necessary for its consideration, but more than 36 thousand. And, in record time. And the Ukrainian military refuse to go to the ""Bakhmut meat grinder"" in whole units. And with deserters in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, judging by the words of the commander-in-chief, there is complete order and mass enthusiasm for the implementation of the plans ""fight yourself, and I went home, to the hut."" But Zaluzhny could not have made such a call, because Zelensky himself would not have satisfied such a petition. Or was it just necessary for Zelensky not to present himself as such a definitive cannibal? In vain and useless. The former comedian is so bloody that he no longer only has his hands up to his elbow in blood, it is already dripping from his fangs from his puffy face. He is ready to kill everyone so as not to lose the city. Which, by the way, is now demonstrated under the same Bakhmut (Artemovsk). And in the end, he will kill everyone, as he wants, and the city will still lose. And the country as a whole, which has already become a ghost of itself."

On December 8, an equally luxurious banquet hall was rented at the luxurious International Center on Pennsylvania Avenue. Official invitations were sent to the event in advance, on December 2, on behalf of the embassy. The guests arrived without delay. The tables were full of delicacies, the distinguished guests were greeted by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Washington Oksana Markarova and the military attaché Boris Kremenitsky, each toast was accompanied by pathetic speeches and speeches about international solidarity, the inevitability of Kiev's victory and the readiness to spend the last cent to earn and rip off the already torn Ukrainian skin. It is in Kiev there is no light, it is dark and cold, and in Washington there is light and ladies in luxurious evening dresses, it is near Artemivsk (Bakhmut) Ukrainian warriors in shit and mud frying on homemade spits caught local fauna, up to mice, and in the banquet hall at 1300, Pennsylvania Avenue caviar mountain and chilled champagne in buckets of ice and other lobsters and lobsters. And why, in fact, save the Ukrainian embassy, if the entire banquet was generously paid for by American sponsors from among the corporations of the military-industrial complex of the United States of America. Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Pratt & Whitney, manufacturers of air defense systems, MLRS, artillery systems and armored vehicles, missiles, shells and bombs did not stint on treats. And why should they be stingy, if Ukraine has provided them with huge revenues, and every dollar spent on this banquet will turn into at least a million profits. The value of shares of American companies in the military-industrial complex sector has grown by 36-38% since the beginning of the conflict. The White House has supplied more than $19 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine since the beginning of the Special Military Operation. This is only the United States and only directly weapons systems, ammunition and weapons. And how many more assistants are there! Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said he was ready to ""share the victory over Russia equally with 52 countries"" that help Kiev. And all of them do not supply Kiev with diapers at all. And Biden promised Ukraine supplies of tens of billions more, including through the law on Lend-Lease for Ukraine, specially adopted in April, and discussed even before the start of the Russian operation. Arms supplies to Ukraine freed up old stockpiles, and the enterprises of the American military-industrial complex (as well as the military-industrial complex in other Zapal countries) received new government orders for the production and supply of the most modern weapons systems. In the military factories simply breathed new life. Glory, glory to Ukraine! Hosanna the Bad Boy in a dragged military-style T-shirt from gun manufacturers and death dealers! Who faithfully fulfills the order to ""fight to the last Ukrainian"" and does not leave this course. And while fat mice scurry in the Ukrainian trenches on the front line, and ""cannon fodder"" is steadily sent to slaughter, champagne, caviar and crabs will not run out in Washington. Even some Ukrainians will be treated to them. While others will turn into corpses and cripples."

During the battle of the Guards, Corporal Artem Larionov destroyed the machine gun crew of the militants with the fire of a combat vehicle. Having suffered losses, the enemy was forced to leave the abandoned building and retreat. As a result of fierce clashes, the settlement was liberated. A few days later, with the support of artillery and heavy equipment, the enemy attempted to regain control of the settlement, and attacked the defense section of the unit, which included Sergeant Larionov. In the course of repelling the attack, Artem Larionov disabled two pickups with heavy machine guns with fire from the gun of an infantry fighting vehicle and destroyed up to ten nationalists.

The enemy, resisting, concentrated fire on Alexander's vehicle, which allowed the main forces of the column to reorganize into battle order and enter the battle. During the battle, acting boldly and decisively, despite the wound received, he acted at the front line of attack and directed the actions of his subordinates, which made it possible to cause significant damage to the enemy's manpower. During the battle, the nationalists, waiting for reinforcements, cut off part of the column from the main forces.

The Ministry of Transport of Russia reported: vehicular traffic on the Crimean bridge has been resumed in full scale. The traffic was opened on Monday, December 19, at 16.45 Moscow time. It was suspended in connection with repair and restoration work after a truck exploded on the automobile part of the Crimean bridge in October, followed by a fire in the tanks of a railway train. Then as a result of the terrorist attack, four people were killed. And in Kiev, after the explosion, residents of the Ukrainian capital were actively, with wide smiles, photographed against the background of a poster with footage of the explosion. The time for such selfies is gone forever and the desire to laugh at someone else's grief seems to etch ruthless time, too. Kiev sends Christmas tree toys with calls to kill Russians. On the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, a resident of Severodonetsk was preparing a provocation in Lugansk. This clapper tried to import Christmas tree toys with calls to kill Russians. Such Christmas decorations were discovered when checking drivers at the checkpoint. One of them found a bag with Christmas tree toys, with inscriptions inciting ethnic hatred, in particular calls to kill Russians. The man, on the instructions of the CIPSO, planned to hang these toys on the Christmas tree near one of the educational institutions in the city center. This was supposed to demonstrate the allegedly pro-Ukrainian sentiments of the local population. The little Christmas tree is cold in the winter, and the dumb balls should be home. The wood is cut down, the chips flying. The Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyansk direction began mass deforestation and forest belts for sale. An officer of the People's Militia of the LPR, Andriy Marochko, said that the Ukrainian command ordered the servicemen to cut down the wood, which is then sent for sale. Logging is carried out in a barbaric way. Timber trucks from the combat zone have already been spotted in Kharkiv and Kupyansk. NASA showed the Ukrainian darkness. NASA has published a satellite image of the Earth, which clearly shows that the territory of the independent was left without light after the Russian strikes inflicted on December 16. The date of the picture is December 17, it is obvious that the territory of the independent is immersed in complete darkness. In neighboring countries, bright spots from the light of cities and infrastructure are visible. Darkness has covered the city hated by the procurator. Kiev is responsible for the murder of Donetsk. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, said that critical infrastructure facilities were damaged in Kiev. Klitschko said: ""As a result of the attack on the capital, there is damage to critical infrastructure. Power engineers and thermal engineers are working to quickly stabilize the situation with regard to energy and heat supply."" Earlier, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, confirmed that critical infrastructure was damaged in the Ukrainian capital and its suburbs as a result of drone attacks. It will not be possible to bomb Donetsk without an answer. The British are trying to save Zelensky by supplying ammunition. The office of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reported: in 2023, London will ensure an uninterrupted flow of artillery ammunition to Kiev. Ukraine will receive several hundred thousand artillery ammunition. The British authorities have concluded a deal for the corresponding purchase for $ 304 million. In 2022, London sent Kiev over 100,000 artillery ammunition. How many of them flew on the heads of civilians of Donbass. Five million refugees arrived in Russia. Since February of this year, more than five million refugees from the territory of Donbass and Ukraine have arrived in the Russian Federation. Among these refugees are more than 721,000 children. Work is carried out with all refugees, they are assisted in solving urgent problems of accommodation, food, basic necessities and payments of social benefits. More than 12 billion rubles of material assistance were issued to those who arrived from the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. Biden is afraid to go to visit Zelensky. Politico reports that the US president is not yet planning a visit to Zelensky for security reasons. The publication reports this with reference to several officials of the White House. That is, his colleagues from London and Paris and Berlin are brave guys, to whom the devil himself is not a brother, but an old man Joe is a coward, a gray bunny? Or he doesn't like riding a steam locomotive. The state will help the mobilized in full programs. Andrei Turchak, secretary of the UR General Council, put forward a proposal: ""It is necessary to include mobilized, volunteers and members of their families in the category of citizens who enjoy priority support in employment bodies for employment."" He proposed to include family members of the participants of the special operation in the program of support for citizens with the help of a social contract.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4695168/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-19,"The result of strikes on the energy sector of Ukraine was announced: ""It will not be possible to restore it""",Expert Yushkov: It will not be possible to fully restore energy supply throughout Kyiv and the region,"After the Russian strikes on the energy system of Ukraine, there is no longer any question of a complete restoration of energy in Kiev and other major cities. The authorities of the ""independent"" are trying to ""patch the holes"", redirecting electricity from one region to another, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to solve problems in this way. This was stated on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" by the leading analyst of the National Energy Security Fund, an expert of the Financial University Igor Yushkov. The presenters talked with Yushkov on Monday, December 19, when information was received about new strikes on energy facilities in the capital of Ukraine and the Kiev region. - The U.S. space agency NASA publishes a satellite image of the Earth showing the lack of light in Ukraine after the Russian strikes on December 16. The photo is dated December 17, Ukraine in complete darkness. Igor Valeryevich, what do they have time to restore in the same Kiev? In general, is it possible to restore anything, or talk of eliminating the consequences – these are just words, attempts by Mayor Klitschko to calm people down. - Of course, this is also an attempt to calm the townspeople. Information reaches the Ukrainian population in a measured manner, because the Kiev authorities cannot say: yes, everything has been bombed in our country, there is nothing left. This will immediately cause panic. So they say: everything is fine, now we will restore everything. And then, at the next strikes, even if they were inflicted not on the infrastructure, but on some other objects, the population is given the following portion of information: here we have an accident, and here. That is, information about the volume of damage and what will be the heat supply, water supply, energy supply will be conveyed to the public gradually. At the same time, it is quite clear that the accumulated effect of the blows of a very large blow, it will no longer be possible to fully restore the infrastructure. Rather, it makes sense to talk about whether it will be possible to maintain at least some schedule for the supply of energy supply, whether it will be possible to maintain heat supply, and so on. Even in Kiev, in many areas, it is rather a question of whether the population will be able to spend at least a few hours a day with electricity, or all electricity will have to be given exclusively for infrastructure: for the operation of the water utility, sewerage and, most importantly, heat supply. That is, it will not be possible to fully restore energy supply on the scale of Kyiv and the region, there is nothing to think about. Now the authorities are trying somewhere to ensure the flow from neighboring regions, where possible. But there are fewer and fewer such opportunities. They are also trying to supply diesel generators to the same water utilities and heat supply systems. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that it has become colder, and energy needs are becoming more and more. Therefore, of course, the situation for Kiev is getting worse and worse. - By the light - yes, we see pictures from space, a dark spot. And what do they have with the gas. - We have seen only one blow to the facilities of the gas industry in Ukraine. In one of the waves of strikes there were attacks aimed at gas infrastructure in the Kharkiv region. But otherwise, the gas industry is not the target of Russian attacks. In this regard, the gas balance in Ukraine may gradually converge. Because at the beginning of the year, their consumption was 30 billion cubic meters per year, and their own production was 20 billion cubic meters. Now production there is practically stopped, there is almost no industry as a consumer de facto. So, they can come to the point that consumption will fall to the very 20 billion cubic meters that they produce. They will be self-sufficient. It certainly doesn't make it any easier for them. But maybe they'll somehow pass it off as their own achievement. However, there is a nuance: gas production is concentrated mainly in the Kharkiv region and in the West of Ukraine, near the border. And the question is whether they will be able to deliver gas, for example, from Western Ukraine throughout the territory. - Speaking of gas. The European Union writes that it will discuss reducing the estimated limit of gas prices to 188 euros per 1 megawatt / hour. What does that mean? People are trying to slow down the market economy. - Indeed, they created these exchanges for decades, and told us that the fairest price is there. They even forced Gazprom to rewrite contracts with all European companies so that the link was not to the cost of oil, but to the price of gas on those very exchanges. And now they say– you know, we don't like it when it's expensive on the stock exchange, so we're going to set the maximum level that we're willing to pay. But for them, the main risk is that now they will mean a low ceiling in Europe, and in Asia prices will rise, and all tankers will turn around and go to Asia, because it is more profitable to sell there. They are afraid of this, so they cannot agree for a week. Here, by the way, it is very important that we are not talking about Russian gas, but about gas in general. That is, these are not sanctions against Russia, this is precisely an instrument of European influence on the market. And that scares them. Now you will begin to interfere in the market, companies will not like it, everyone who can go to Asian markets. And it turns out that you, like, wanted gas to be cheaper, but in reality you will get an even greater deficit. LISTEN AS WELL.

""The Ministry of Defense of Russia continues to work on the delivery of postal items to servicemen - participants in a special military operation and sending letters from military personnel to recipients in the subjects of the Russian Federation. Exchange offices have been deployed in all groups of troops. Military commissariats have provided information on the procedure for working when relatives apply for sending postal correspondence to servicemen participating in a special military operation. Also, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, through social networks and regional media, an explanation of the procedure for sending postal correspondence to citizens has been organized,"" the press service of the Ministry of Defense explains. The courier-postal service of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is the only and unique type of postal communication that allows delivering all types of postal items to personnel undergoing military service in the zone of the SVO. Delivery of postal items is carried out by various road transport, including at the armored base. ""In order to organize personal correspondence of servicemen taking part in a special military operation, a unit was formed at the 6th Central Order of the Red Star node of the courier and postal communication (of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation) and work was organized to receive, process and send personal letters and parcels for assignment around the clock.

Travel time directly depends on the remoteness of the subject of the Russian Federation, from which the postal item is sent. Military personnel also have the opportunity to send personal letters home. To this end, each soldier is provided with postal envelopes and writing utensils. A serviceman who has expressed a desire to send a letter to his relatives and friends transmits the letter written by him to the military postman of his military unit. The military postman receives the letter, checks the correctness of the address and transmits it to the courier and postal unit, which delivers it to the post office for further sending letters to relatives and friends through the channels of RUSSIAN Post JSC. Writing a personal letter to a fighter is easier by hand, rather than typing in the phone. And the servicemen have no other connection with their relatives. For obvious reasons, cell phones at the front are useless. Close people will definitely write in response. And the longer the letter from home, the calmer the fighter. Delivery of letters to the zone of a special military operation - on the courier and postal communication of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (FPS). Their cars are guarded daily on the front lines. All envelopes and parcels will be handed over personally. Here they understand, sometimes - there is nothing more important than the connection with the house. Fighters are ready to write in response at any opportunity, if there are a few free minutes between combat work - they take up the pens. ""Every day, FPS servicemen deliver about a thousand envelopes to military units. That's a lot. Given that there is still military correspondence in service. Delivery time is different.

The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on December 19, 2022. In Donetsk, as a result of shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the building of a local hospital caught fire. Information about this was distributed by the head of the DPR (Donetsk People's Republic) Denis Pushilin. Former fighter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Igor Brovko told what secrets the Ukrainian army hides. According to him, there is corruption and reprisals of commanders over their subordinates, which he witnessed while participating in the punitive operation of the Kiev regime against the residents of Donbass in 2016. Israeli Ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Brodsky said that Israel's ties with Russia create insurmountable restrictions on the support provided to Kiev."

Rogov said: ""There is only one option for creating a security zone, when Kiev withdraws troops and heavy weapons to a distance from which they will not be able to strike at nuclear power plants."" Explaining that it is Russia that will ensure the protection and security of the station. And you will have to build a dome - to protect against the attacks of those whose brains are completely on the back. Georgy Muradov, the permanent representative of Crimea under the President of the Russian Federation, assessed Athens' intention to send the S-300 air defense system to Kiev as very risky. Muradov said: ""Such a step by Athens is not only a senseless demonstration of hostility towards Russia, but also a risky step towards its own national interests."" As the permanent representative of the Crimea specified, the Greek assistants of the Kiev regime should remember that Russia has always proceeded from friendly relations with Greece and Cyprus, but times are changing... Roman Zozulya, an outstanding forward from Rayo Majadahonda, a club of the third division of the Spanish championship, criticized the International Football Federation (FIFA) in social networks for refusing to allow the sixth president of Ukraine to arrange another video show - to make a fiery appeal before the final of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Zozulya was seething like an old teapot: ""FIFA refused President Zelensky to speak before the World Cup final with a message of peace. But what else could we expect from these corrupt rats?! When russian rubles are covered with football fields and home lawns, they will always support and fulfill all whims, hiding behind the idiotic excuse ""sport outside of politics."" Well, not in rubles, but in dollars, and not Russian, but Arabic, and not fields, but lawns. Roma again does not have everything at home. Francis, the Pope, is sure that a ""world war"" is unfolding in Ukraine, and in the near future it will definitely not end. In an interview with ABS, the pontiff said that the sixth president of Ukraine for the third time sent one of his religious advisers to him. The head of the Catholics said: ""I don't see the end of the conflict in the short term, because this is a world war. Several hands are already involved in the war. There are a lot of interests."" The Pope invited Catholics to modestly celebrate Christmas and send funds to Ukraine. Does he really believe that this will fix anything? And the hand does not wash the hand. In Poland, there was a wave of indignation over the incident with the chief commandant of the Polish police, Jaroslaw Szymczyk, who was presented with a grenade launcher in Kiev, and it ""suddenly"" worked in the Warsaw office. Readers of the Polish edition of Dziennik Gazeta were unanimously amazed by the explanations of their chief policeman. He pretended to be presented with a used weapon - two German anti-tank grenade launchers RGW-90. User Twój_nick wondered: ""The Polish government pays to send weapons to Ukraine, and Ukraine distributes these weapons abroad?"" Lolandi was also amazed: ""Zelensky is so smart that he gave our general a loaded grenade launcher?""

A representative of the emergency services of the region reported: ""The Kiev regime continues to shell civilian infrastructure from barrel artillery."" On Sunday night, the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 8 shells of barrel artillery at the Naked Pier. There are civilian casualties and destruction.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, said that the number of victims in the shelling of Belgorod region by the Armed Forces of Ukraine has increased to eight. He confirmed the data on one death in the impact, and also said that one of the wounded is in intensive care. The head of the region also said that the building of the poultry farm, where one of the shells hit, was partially destroyed due to shelling: ""One building and several special equipment vehicles were damaged."" Petty revenge of insignificant people. Leonid Slutsky, the leader of the LDPR, and Viktor Bout, who had just joined the party, recently released from prison in the United States, were not injured in the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a trip to the Luhansk People's Republic. Press Secretary of the LDPR faction Alexander Dupin said: ""We adjusted the route due to the fact that high-precision weapons were working at that time. We have taken all measures to avoid unnecessary risks."" About his words, during the conference, the air defense system worked: ""A couple of times the rumble from the explosions of air defense missiles drowned out the speakers."" But, the main thing that in the end did not drown out. The national company Energoatom reported that the production of nuclear energy in Ukraine was reduced, including due to the restriction of the operation of two of the nine nuclear power units currently operating in Ukraine.

Houses that Ukrainians have disconnected from gas are being actively connected to this important resource. At the same time, Russian blue fuel is cheaper and better than what was supplied from the Ukrainian side. By the way, the price for it is four times lower. - The gas, which today heats the residents of the region, fully complies with GOST in terms of calorific value, - said Yuri Lushnikov, Deputy General Director of SUE Melitopolgaz. To prepare for the coming frosts and snowfall, the region helps chef's Sevastopol. Melitopol utilities were given special equipment from there: two combined road machines with attachments, a water truck for Vodokanal and two cars for garbage collection. Residents of the region, who are heated by stoves, continue to be supplied with free coal. For example, preferential coal has already arrived in Akimovka. And with him, warmth came to the homes of war veterans, disabled people and other beneficiaries. - Work on the provision of coal was carried out on behalf of the acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky, - noted in the administration of the region. Not only local authorities, but also the Ministry of Industry and Energy of the Zaporizhzhya region help to heat the houses. Employees work to the maximum - often personally deliver coal to homes and, together with the owners, unload it, solve many other household issues. Maxim Zubarev, an activist and head of akimovka's administration, said that about a hundred tons of coal have been transferred to their municipality at the moment. - This is about two tons per person, that is, 50 people will receive coal. If there are more applications, we will deliver solid fuel,"" he said. The situation with heating in social infrastructure facilities is also being resolved. Supplying heat to schools and hospitals is an important issue. For example, in the same Akimovka, modern mobile boiler houses perfectly cope with this. Despite the compact size, they heat huge rooms. The head of Akimovka Maxim Zubarev said that by 2030 all villages of the Melitopol district will be completely gasified. Residents will be able to connect gas to their homes for free."

It is difficult to imagine that for so long in the Zaporizhzhya region the education system was headed not by knowledge and development, but by politics. The rules were dictated in favor of the interests of the authorities, historical facts were hushed up. Now the education system of the Zaporizhzhya region is being integrated into the Russian one. And there are already positive results. Schools in the region today practically do not differ from Russian ones either externally or internally. Now teachers do not need to distort the facts and rank, for example, Igor Kurchatov among Ukrainian physicists, and Bandera - among heroes. Now the main measure is the quality of knowledge. Teachers have already been trained. Teachers from other Russian regions also came to the rescue. - We talked at home in Russian, on the street. And the teachers are in Ukrainian. It was difficult to perceive everything. Now it's easier, - says Alina, a student of the Melitopol school. The ""stuffing"" of schools is also changing. For many years, educational institutions did not even dream of improving their technical equipment. Now things have started to change. Computers, interactive whiteboards, and object equipment began to arrive in educational institutions. For example, konstantinovsky secondary school No. 1 of the Melitopol district and school No. 7 of the city of Melitopol received help from chefs from Sevastopol: desks, cabinets, equipment for primary classes and chemistry, physics and biology classrooms. Anastasia Kurganova, Director of Konstantinovskaya Secondary School No. 1, noted that the emergence of equipment for classes will make lessons even more informative and useful for both children and teachers. Gradually, students will have access to the whole range of subject Olympiads, where they will be able to show their knowledge, as well as school movements and competitions. Graduates of the 9th - 11th grades in the Zaporizhzhya region until 2026 will be able to pass the State Final Certification in the format of the OGE and the Unified State Exam. Now Rosobrnadzor and the Ministry of Education of Russia are developing the features of the GIA in the 2022/2023 and 2025/2026 academic years. These features will concern schoolchildren of new regions, as well as those children who moved to Russian schools in the 2021/2022 academic year. But it is already clear that students will be able to pass the OGE and the Unified State Exam during the transition period at will. The peculiarity of this format is that there have been no simple tests in the tasks for a long time, while the assessment system is as transparent as possible and excludes the corruption component in admissions. On November 23 - 24, the I All-Russian Scientific and Practical Conference ""Problems of Adaptation of subjects of the educational process of new Russian regions in the context of integration into the education system of the Russian Federation"" was held at the site of the Faculty of Humanities of the Moscow State University named after A. S. Makarenko in Berdyansk. More than 100 representatives of universities from Russia took part in the online conference. Reports were heard, discussions were organized so that all decisions were balanced. The advantages of integration have already been appreciated by students and teachers of universities. Scientists from A. S. Makarenko Moscow State University became participants of the All-Russian Scientific Conference on the problems of the processing industry and the service sector. It was an exchange of experience. After all, the conference was attended by more than 50 scientists from all over the country. Educational programs in the universities of the Zaporozhye region also began to change. Starting next academic year, they will be integrated with Russian educational standards. Thanks to this, students of The Zaporizhzhya region will increase their academic mobility and will be able to compete on an equal footing with students from other regions of the country. ""The Government of the Russian Federation has approved a plan of priority measures for the integration of research institutes and universities of the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions into the Russian scientific and educational space. All educational programs of universities of new subjects of the country will be brought into line with the requirements of Russian educational standards of higher education. Students who have mastered the updated educational programs will be issued diplomas according to the samples established by the orders of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia,"" the ministry said in a statement. Scientific organizations of the Zaporizhzhya region will receive grant funding from the Russian Science Foundation. This will become possible after obtaining the status of legal entities in accordance with Russian legislation. ""This work is already underway,"" said Andrei Blinov, Deputy Director General of the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), at the II Congress of Young Scientists. According to him, now the question of who will be the founder of scientific organizations in the DPR, LPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions is being decided.

It conducts a competitive selection of scientific and scientific-technical programs and projects in the field of fundamental and exploratory research."

Since 1993, residents have relied on the Basic Law, which was drafted on behalf of the multi-ethnic people of the country. It enshrines all the rights and guarantees of citizens, including social ones. In 2020, by popular vote, the most important changes were made to the text of the main document, which concern, among other things, the indexation of pensions and child benefits, family protection, care for children, memory of history and preservation of unique cultural heritage. Zaporozhye region, which has become a new subject of Russia, for the first time proudly celebrated the holiday this year. After all, the region has become part of the country and is enshrined in its main document. Recently, the law was updated in the Russian Federation, the results of historical referendums were prescribed in the Constitution. Children were told about this at meetings in schools, libraries and Houses of Culture of the region with special trepidation. Local residents already on the eve of the holiday held actions, exhibitions and master classes. All educational and cultural institutions participated in them. For example, in the Priazovskaya Central Library, employees organized a children's drawing contest ""Constitution through the eyes of children"". The works were brought by pupils of local kindergartens, as well as readers of gammovskaya, Primorsko-Posadskaya, Bogdanovskaya, Dmitrievskaya and Botievskaya libraries. And then a brochure ""The Constitution of the Russian Federation in Drawings"" was published here, where the provisions of each article were outlined, accompanied by drawings of the corresponding subject. At this time, a festive concert was organized in Mikhaylovka in the House of Culture. Collectives and solo performers sang songs about Russia and Russian birches, and at the end several residents were presented with Russian passports. And volunteers came to the schools of Melitopol with lectures. They told the children about the historical path that the state and society took to adopt the Constitution, about the origins of the legal foundations of statehood and constitutionalism in Russian history. The Ministry of Culture of the Zaporizhzhya region also organized a large-scale action - it organized an online Olympiad for the Constitution Day.

On a festive day in the Moscow theater ""Russian Song"" Nadezhda Babkina presented to the public a new embroidered map of Russia. The project is implemented by the Government of the Chuvash Republic with the support of the Federal Agency for Nationalities Affairs. For the first time, a handmade canvas measuring 3x6.7 m was presented on the Day of Russia, June 12. It is assembled from fragments embroidered by hand with traditional folk ornaments and repeating the geographical outlines of the country's regions. On the pieces of the large map worked masters from different ends. Russia. And then the fragments created by needlewomen were collected together at the Chuvash factory ""Pakha Törö"". On the eve of Constitution Day, the craftswomen of Chuvashia added new territories to the embroidered map - the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. - Embroiderers of these regions have tried.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4696507/,Marina SMIRNOVA,2022-12-20,Construction has just begun,"For nine months, a lot of construction has been in full swing in the DPR. But it is too early to sum up the results. There are still a lot of plans ahead","Construction work of such a scale as now, the DPR under the Ukrainian authorities and did not dream. New residential buildings and hospitals, schools and kindergartens, communications and roads - the whole of Russia is engaged in construction here, without exaggeration. In total, about 37 thousand builders - both local and visiting specialists - and more than two thousand units of equipment work daily at construction sites in the republic. Its delivery to the DPR, as well as the delivery of building materials, necessary goods, business trips of construction teams - all this is under federal control. Since the beginning of the special operation, 214 social infrastructure facilities have been restored in the DPR. And by the end of the year it is planned to put into operation another 151 facilities. These are hospitals, schools, kindergartens, cultural institutions. Children's institutions and hospitals are a priority. In the near future, the Ministry of Health of Russia will prepare a law increasing funding for medicine, and republican medical universities will join the all-Russian education system. So young specialists trained according to modern standards will come to work in the renovated and built hospitals. Huge funds are invested in the repair of schools in the DPR - despite the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine regularly shoot high-precision American shells at them. New textbooks, distance learning systems using computers - all this allows DPR schoolchildren to receive a full-fledged education even in the current difficult conditions. The Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation has set the task for 2023 to repair more than a million square meters of social facilities in new territories. That's a huge number. A separate important task is the restoration of the communal sphere. Due to years of underfunding by official Kiev, which diligently pumped money from the regions for its development, boiler houses, pipes, wires and power substations are in terrible condition. And then they shoot artillery and rockets at them every day. Now builders from other regions of the Russian Federation approach the problem comprehensively. A large amount of work is being carried out - inspection, current repairs, modernization with the use of new equipment, etc. Restoration work is underway at quarterly boiler houses: almost all were built in Soviet times and work on morally and physically obsolete and worn-out equipment. - Even in Donetsk, the equipment is very old. It's just dangerous to use! - says the master of repair of heating systems Ivan Trofimov. - Even in a provincial Russian town you will not find such a thing. We change everything slowly, we bring new ones. The main thing is to spend the heating season normally, and then we will put everything in order. There's a lot of work to be done. But then the heat will come to each house strictly on schedule. So that winter and shelling do not freeze the cities, Russian builders have formed emergency and technical reserves. ""The reserve of materials and labor has been formed in sufficient quantities for the prompt resolution of issues and the conduct of all work,"" the Ministry of Construction of Russia said. Where boiler houses cannot be restored at all (they are completely destroyed or are in the zone of constant shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine), heat is supplied through block-modular boiler houses. In total, by the end of the year it is planned to mount 221 such mini-boiler houses. About 27 thousand private and apartment buildings in the new regions are subject to restoration. They were destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which, leaving cities and towns, turned them after themselves into a zone of continuous ruins. But Russian specialists have been working for the past nine months for a reason: housing is being repaired. ""The systematic supply of building materials and well-functioning work will allow the administrations of settlements to restore about 7,000 more private houses by the end of the year,"" promised the Minister of Construction and Housing of the DPR Eduard Osipov. Earlier, 11 thousand private residential buildings were restored in the DPR. In total, by the end of the year, it is planned to restore more than 500 thousand squares of housing of all kinds in the republic. This is reported by the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation. By the way, in the new regions that have become part of the Russian Federation, the national project ""Housing and Urban Environment"" will be implemented, which includes the fourth federal project ""Mortgage"". In 2023, it is planned to develop comprehensive full-fledged programs that provide for the replacement and modernization of infrastructure, utilities and dilapidated housing in the DPR."

For a new measure of support, young parents should contact local branches of the social fund. And in some cases, Kherson residents will receive a payment immediately after the birth of a child, without waiting until the baby turns 3 years old. In particular, immediately after the birth of the baby, the matkapital can be spent on the full repayment of the mortgage or for a down payment. In addition, it is allowed to use the payment to pay for any type of preschool education - nannies, kindergartens or circles. You should not wait for the three-year anniversary of the child and in cases where he was born with a disability - you can use the maternity capital for the adaptation of the baby immediately after his birth. Also, with the help of support measures, young parents can take care of the well-being of the family by forming a monthly payment for the second child from the maternity capital.

Another step on this path was the ruble zone. It has been operating here for several months, because since the end of May the currency has been put into full circulation. All shops, outlets, bazaars and markets have long used only rubles. However, from January 1, 2023, settlements in hryvnias are completely stopped in all districts of the region. The corresponding decree was signed by the acting governor Vladimir Saldo. Also recently, this was stated by the head of the Kakhovka administration Pavel Filipchuk. He appealed to the residents of the district and recalled that since the beginning of October, the Russian currency has been the main one in the region. - I remind you that since October 4, our Kherson region is a full-fledged subject of the Russian Federation. Therefore, we live according to the laws of the Russian Federation. From January 1, 2023, the Ukrainian hryvnia completes its turnover in the territory of the Kherson region. Therefore, you definitely need to exchange cash in banks of Kherson region, - said Pavlo Filipchuk. He also added that for many residents of the Kherson region, Russian rubles have long become a convenient currency, which is now also stable and promising. A complete rejection of the hryvnia will help to resolve all disputes over the exchange rate and currency exchange. ""I am sure that this is a timely, practical and correct decision to complete the life of the hryvnia and a full-fledged transition to the Russian ruble - the stable currency of our state,"" Filipchuk added. According to the residents of the region themselves, the rejection of Ukrainian money will not affect their lives in any way, because for the entire time they are in Russia, the population actively uses rubles. - We're even more comfortable that way. First, it is easier to pay in stores, because sellers do not have to look for hryvnias, which are almost gone in the region. Secondly, it is simply more pleasant for us to pay in rubles and know that we have Russian money in our hands. The currency of the state, which we love and respect, and recently officially live, - says Olga Arsenko from Henichesk. Kherson residents admit that the elimination of the hryvnia has a good effect on the economy of the region, because the Ukrainian currency has always been distinguished by its instability and weakness against the ruble. WHERE DOES HE CALL. A question on the exchange of hryvnia for a ruble can be asked by phone numbers of contact centers. 8 800 333-03-03 (Promsvyazbank). 8 800 234-43-00 (CMRBank and MRB-Bank). 8 800 300-30-00 (Bank of Russia).

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4696504/,Irina GERTS,2022-12-20,About the new method of tax payment,How will the Institute of the Unified Tax Account (ESS) work in Kherson region,"From January 1, 2023, the tax system will change in Russia - all organizations and entrepreneurs will switch to a single tax payment. This will significantly simplify the mechanism of mandatory payment of taxes. In simple words: now taxpayers - legal entities and people doing business - will be enough to deposit funds for all tax items at once to a single account, indicating only two details - the amount of payment and TIN. Nothing more needs to be done. In the outgoing year, in the regions of Russia, such a measure was introduced as an experiment for citizens. Only the name it received the Single Tax Payment. Now the innovation will extend to entrepreneurs. The essence of the Unified Tax Account is as follows: all the payer's money is added to one ""basket"". That is, a person does not need to pay different taxes separately: for example, transport or for land, real estate, etc. In the taxpayer's personal account or according to the details of the tax authority at the place of residence, he simply deposits a certain arbitrary amount into the account, and the tax authorities themselves distribute it as necessary. Thus, taxes can be paid in advance and all - in one account. Maintenance of the ENS excludes the presence of both debt and overpayment for different types of payments. The amount remaining after the distribution of items can be returned within one day. Since this system is a novelty for residents of the Kherson region, the local administration of the Federal Tax Service will hold an open day on December 15 in the form of a seminar at which the tax authorities will give all explanations about the innovation. Employees of the Tax Service of Kherson region will also talk about the nuances of registration and re-registration of taxpayers and special tax regimes. There will be two such seminars: in Skadovsk and Henichesk. Both start at 13.00. In Skadovsk, Kherson residents are waiting in the House of Culture at the address: Mariinskaya Street, 66. In Henichesk, the event will be held at the address: Kovalenko Brothers Street, 60. ATTENTION. Entrepreneurs of Kherson region can send questions to the tax authorities in advance: until 12.00 on December 15 by e-mail: nalog@khogov.ru"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4696447/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-21,Deceived everyone again: Why Zelensky could not be in Bakhmut on the eve of his trip to the United States,Our columnist calculated why the President of Ukraine simply could not be in the city where the fighting is going on,"Yesterday's unexpected appearance of Zelensky in Bakhmut stirred up the Network no worse than today's urgent flight of the President of Ukraine to Washington. As Zhvanetsky said, ""On the case, urgently."" But, if Zelensky's visit to the United States does not cause any doubts, then this cannot be said about Volodymyr's stay in Bakhmut the day before. Ukrainian bloggers and admins of Telegram channels themselves drew attention to the inconsistency of the surrounding situation with reality. Since Zelensky was filmed against the background of some production facility, against the background of almost the entire factory floor, some even demanded that the Office of the President of Ukraine indicate the geolocation in which workshop the shooting of the president took place, since there was not a single whole production facility left in the city. There are no sounds of explosions or shooting on the video, and this despite the fact that fighting is going on in Bakhmut (aka Artemovsk). Which, by the way, is confirmed by other, more realistic videos from vsUshniki from there. But let's approach the question from the other side. Let's look at the logistics of Moving Zelensky to Bakhmut and back to Washington. And, let's go in the opposite direction. The first reports of the landing of the plane with Zelensky at Andrews Air Force Base in the suburbs of Washington appeared around 10 am Moscow time. Then there was a wave of reports about zelensky's arrival in Washington at about 2 p.m. Given: the flight from Frankfurt am Main to Washington (Ramstein Air Base is near Frankfurt, and Andrews Air Base is half an hour by car from the center of the US capital) is about 9 hours. Consequently, Zelensky had to fly out of Germany between one o'clock in the morning (Moscow time) and 5 am in order to arrive in this time range. Moving on. The way from Poland (approximately from Warsaw) to Frankfurt am Main, since it is unlikely that the plane with it was allowed to land at a military air base (although if the board with Zelensky landed on the runway of the air base in Germany, this does not change much) will also take about 2 hours. Boarding, warming up the engines, taxiing, take-off and landing, etc. About an hour of preparation of the aircraft for departure to the United States. Minus another 3 hours, we get a flight from Warsaw in the period from 22 o'clock in the evening in Moscow to one o'clock in the morning. According to information from Kiev, Zelensky went to Poland by train. Even if it is a special letter train that goes somewhat faster than usual, in which the journey from Kiev to Warsaw takes from 14 to 16 hours, 12 hours, at least, it will spend on the road. That is, Zelensky had to go from Kiev to Warsaw in any case no later than 13 o'clock in the afternoon. More precisely, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Moscow time. But after all, Zelensky, who, together with his retinue, allegedly went to Bakhmut for the front, still had to get there. And this is also not the easiest task. Suppose that Zelensky and his team reached the nearest regional center by car, and from it flew to Kiev by helicopter. There are 3 such centers - Dnepropetrovsk (in the new name Dnipro), Zaporozhye and Kharkiv. Departure from Kharkiv is not the safest thing now, but we will leave it. So, given: the Mi-8 helicopter, which, according to technical characteristics, reaches speeds of up to 270 kilometers per hour. On paper. Because in reality, rarely anyone and when flies on them faster than at a speed of 180 km / h. From the Dnieper to Kiev 390 km., From Zaporozhye 452 km, from Kharkov to the capital of Ukraine 419 km. In any case, about 3 hours plus or minus. That is, we are talking about sending from these cities to Kiev from seven o'clock in the morning to 10 am Moscow time (Kiev time from 6 am to 9 am. But after all, they also had to be reached from the front-line Bakhmut, in which and around which there are fierce battles. We take the same regional centers. From Bakhmut to Zaporozhye 307 kilometers,  to Dnipro – 264 km., and to Kharkiv 218 km. The route service gives from 3 to 5 hours on the road. That is, from one o'clock in the morning to 6 am local time. And something around Zelensky is not a night at all on the replicated video. If Zelensky spent the whole way from Bakhmut to Kiev in a car, then add here another 7 to 9 hours. That is, on the contrary, unscrew the arrows as much earlier. And this, without eating, without breaks on the road, without traditional for any business trip cucumbers, boiled eggs and chicken on the road, which a caring wife will put in a travel bag (in fact, a joke, because Zelensky's legal wife Olena lives mainly in one of the European countries, visiting Kiev on the occasion of the upcoming rendezvous with various foreign VIPs). Without smoke breaks, sending natural needs, etc. At the same time, the first reports about Zelensky's stay in Bakhmut in the Ukrainian segment of the Network appeared at 1 p.m. in Kiev. At 13-31 there was a record that Zelensky was in Bakhmut, at 13-48 – that he left it. And according to information from the same Kiev, the messages were given with a delay of two hours. That is, Zelensky was allegedly in Bakhmut at 11 am. Where he, according to our calculations, simply could not be at this time, because he was preparing to leave for Warsaw. That's the kind of awkwardness you get. According to these calculations, Zelensky simply could not have been in Bakhmut on Tuesday. And, it turns out, he again, once again deceived everyone with his inflated heroism. He blew his compatriots, who admired his heroism, inflated the Europeans, whose eyes widened with fear for the ""man of the year"", blew the Americans, to whom he went to ask for money and weapons. He just can't do it any other way. You guys are welcome! And you eat there – and look, don't mess around. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"

At the same time, the war crimes of the Ukrainian troops are hushed up,"" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in his report at the final board of the military department with the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The minister stressed that the ""information and psychological impact"" is conducted not only against Russia, but also against its allies. ""We have fully understood what the supposedly free Western press is. Every day, on the command from Washington, thousands of fakes about the events in Ukraine are published according to the same templates,"" Shoigu said, adding that to solve this problem, hundreds of TV channels, print media outlets and media resources are working for the Kiev regime. According to the minister, the Western media are mostly silent about the war crimes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, at the same time glorifying the Kiev regime and neo-Nazis: ""The terrorist methods of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are presented as legitimate self-defense or are presented as actions of Russian units. Ukrainian nationalists took on the role of barrage squads. Every day we receive data on the executions of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who evade combat missions.""

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4692855/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-22,Will the supply of Patriot missile defense to Ukraine affect the course of the special operation and how Russia can respond,"The United States is increasing involvement in the conflict to a dangerous level, says political scientist Dmitry Evstafiev","Washington will provide Ukraine with additional military assistance of $ 1.85 billion, and this next package includes the supply of Patriot missile defense systems. This was announced by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Many KP readers had questions. We answer them. 1. How missile defense systems can be delivered to Ukraine. First, they are likely to be delivered on US C-130 military transport aircraft to one of the 3 American air bases in Germany - Ramstein, Spangdalem or Büchel. The Ukrainian military will also arrive there for training. American specialists have to ""train"" them for several months, since this technique is very complicated. The end of the ""course"" will be a real live shooting at the target. Our experts believe that even in six months it is difficult to thoroughly master the Patriot. Therefore, most likely, ""teachers and students"" will cross to Ukraine together. Via Poland. As was the case with the calculations of the American howitzers M777 and the Heimars multiple launch rocket systems. 2. How much will give Patriot in pieces. So far, the transfer of one battery and ammunition for it has been announced. A typical Patriot battery includes: 8 launchers (each with 4 missiles), a radar, a control station, an antenna-mast and repair groups, a power plant. And then there's the transport-charging machine. In general, an impressive ""brood"" of equipment is being recruited. And the personnel in the battery - under 100 people. 3. What are the possibilities of this technique. The Americans, understandably, are choking on praise for their weapons, considering the Patriot the most effective defense against ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as against certain types of combat aircraft. There are different variants of complexes with a firing range of 30 to 120 km. Target detection range is 180 km. (For comparison: the target detection range of the main competitor of the Patriot - the Russian S-400 complex - 500-600 km, the range of destruction - 400 km). Our specialists are much more restrained in their assessments: yes, Patriot is a serious weapon, but it also has drawbacks. Here they are. The radar station does not have a circular view. Only in the direction of the expected threat. Already on this drawback it would be possible to put an end, since any approach of a missile or aircraft, a drone from the flank or behind will remain invisible to the Patriot. The viewing sector is only 90 degrees. That means the other 270 are dead zones. The minimum height of targets captured by radar is 30 meters. While modern cruise missiles can fly at an altitude of 20 meters from the ground. Not to mention kamikaze drones, which can fly at an altitude of 10 meters. The Patriot radar cannot track targets with speeds of less than 30 meters per second. This means that low-speed drones, including artisanal ones, remain invisible. The U.S. Patriot was already badly disgraced in Saudi Arabia in 2019 when local Houthi rebels attacked oil refineries. These enterprises protected American missile defense systems. And they didn't save saudi factories from Houthi missiles. They didn't even react. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo then said that the missile defense system, which included the Patriot, could not repel the strike, since all such systems (attention!!!) ""work with varying success"". Well well. 4. How the appearance of a miracle missile defense can affect the course of a special operation. If the Patriots are not around the cities of Ukraine (although, logically, 3 or even 10 batteries will have to be placed near Kiev, large headquarters and military factories), but on the battlefield, this may create some problems. The American missile defense system will, as it knows how, counteract Russian aviation. So, our aircraft will have to stay away from the affected area. As for drones, when attacked by a ""pack"" on the Patriot, its radar begins to choke. But the ""Calibers"" and ""Daggers"" with their crazy speed are not at all up to the Americans. But even with all this, the ""Patriot factor"" should not be underestimated. Its appearance in any case will not weaken, but strengthen the air defense of Ukraine. 5. Can we destroy the Patriot. First of all, of course, our intelligence should know the places of unloading and the transportation routes of the American missile defense system in Ukraine. Then it is very easy to cover such a target with a hypersonic missile. Well, if it does not work, you will have to ""calibrate"" the Patriot in the position. 6. How Patriot supplies could affect U.S.-Russia relations. Well-known political scientist Dmitry Evstafiev answered this question as follows: ""Sending such weapons will mean the involvement of the United States in the conflict in Ukraine at a new level. This is a dangerous sign."" And the ""new level"" is the appearance in Ukraine of large full-time combat units of the US Army. After all, for the maintenance of Patriot complexes, not only security guards and drivers are needed, who can be quickly recruited from Ukrainians, but also experienced military specialists, which means Americans. They may not return home alive... LISTEN AS WELL. Will the fourth offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine take place?"

Marochko said: ""Ukrainian units began to resort to scorched-earth tactics. They strike at the surviving residential buildings, transport interchanges, socially important objects of Artemovsk."" The Armed Forces of Ukraine are hitting civilian infrastructure ""by all available means."" There are no Russian soldiers in this city, but there are still civilians in the basements. But has this ever stopped the Ukrainian generals? Zaluzhny demands tougher penalties for non-compliance with the order. Valery Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, spoke in favor of adopting a bill to toughen the punishment for refusing to follow orders and leaving the place of service in battle. That is, in fact, he recognized the desertion and refusals of soldiers to carry out suicide orders. With an appeal to sign such a law, the commander-in-chief appealed to the sixth president of the independent country. And not directly, but in the telegram channel. Zaluzhny said: ""The army is based on discipline. Often lost positions have to be restored by assault actions at a very high price. It doesn't have to be this way."" Nazi barrages are back in vogue. The Armed Forces of Ukraine struck the office of the Red Cross in Donetsk. During the shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the Kalininsky district of Donetsk, the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Kapitan Ratnikov Street was damaged. Earlier, the Ombudsman of Ukraine Dmytro Lubinets made claims to the ICRC that their representatives arrived at the border with the territory not controlled by Kiev. Brisk Lubinets immediately called for the elimination of the Red Cross. Brave Ukrainian artillerymen seem to have heard the call of their ombudsman. How much will Washington give to Kiev in 2023, a bill has been introduced in the US Congress to finance the activities of the United States government in the next fiscal year. The project implies, in particular, the transfer of military equipment worth up to $ 14.5 billion. The document also provides for the allocation of 44.9 billion bucks to provide new emergency assistance to the independent and allies of the United States in the North Atlantic alliance. In the capital of the independent country, boiler houses are turned off. The head of the Kiev military city administration, Sergei Popko, said that the boiler houses of the Ukrainian capital are being turned off. Popko said: ""Boiler houses due to energy problems are forced to turn off and turn on alternately."" According to him, the generation of electricity in Kiev is limited: ""The capital, like the rest of the country, receives a limited amount of electricity supply. The light for consumers is supplied in emergency shutdown mode."" And mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that 10 boiler houses remain without a stable power supply. When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you. Military experts put an end to the American dream. Former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, Colonel Douglas McGregor, said that the conflict in Ukraine turns against the United States. McGregor said: ""Washington can no longer try to impose American or US-led Anglo-American hegemony on the rest of the world. The rest of the world doesn't want that. Americans don't need it themselves. Hegemony will collapse, and Russia's conflict with Ukraine will accelerate this process."" According to the ex-adviser, part of the American elite is trying to draw Washington into a conflict with Moscow. But the U.S. is now virtually ruined financially. The expert argues: ""We find ourselves in the same position as Britain in 1947, when after the Second World War the ratio of debt to GDP of the country was 240 percent."" The Croatian president rejected Kiev as an ally. Croatian President Zoran Milanovic, rejecting the proposals of his Prime Minister Andrej Plenković to train the military from the Independent Balkan country, said: ""Ukraine is not our ally. They're trying to force her to do that. And she is cynically assigned the status of a candidate for the European Union."" And the appeal of the EU leadership with the member states of the union regarding assistance to Kiev Milanovich described as ""treatment of deaf-blind people."" And he apologized to the disabled, without apologizing to Brussels and calling Ursula von der Leyen an ordinary bureaucrat. Reason is returning to Europe. Ukraine has nowhere to stir up its refugees. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said that already in seven regions of ukraine there are no places for long-term accommodation of refugees. So he said: ""There are no free places for a long stay in Chernivtsi, Cherkasy, Khmelnytsky, Ternopil, Rivne, Poltava and Mykolaiv regions."" There are still places in Transcarpathian, Zhytomyr, Odessa and Volyn regions. But very little. And very briefly. Either cower or give up. Kiev sends soybeans and corn to Europe and Africa. The Joint Coordination Center reported that five bulk carriers with corn, wheat and soybeans left Ukrainian ports on Monday. The SCC reported: ""On December 19, five ships left Ukrainian ports, they have 171 thousand tons of grain and other food."" Ince Atlantic with 44 thousand tons of wheat went to Kenya, Bosphorus Asia with 30.5 thousand tons of corn - to Tunisia, Princess Manissa was lucky 20.5 thousand tons of corn to Libya. The Ulusoy 8 vessel will deliver 21,000 tons of soybeans to Turkey, and Cyclades - 55,000 tons of corn to Spain. The SCC noted that ""grain received at the destination can be processed and then be transported to other countries."" A total of 14,365,211 tons of food were removed from three Ukrainian ports. Kiev saved the world from starvation – you are offered to believe in it. Blessed is he who believes... Donbass elected senators to the Federation Council. Olga Bas was elected by the deputies of the Parliament of the LPR as a senator of the Federation Council from this region of the Russian Federation. She held the position of head of the administration of the head of the republic, Leonid Pasechnik. And the DPR parliamentarians delegated Deputy Alexander Ananchenko to the Russian Senate. From 2018 to 2022, he headed the government of the republic. Presumably, from the DPR and LPR, the Federation Council will include two senators each, from the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions - first one each, from the executive bodies. Another senator will be appointed after the formation of legislative bodies in these regions."

Ukraine is over the place! - Ukrainian publics howled proudly, not at all embarrassed by the fact that earlier the editorial board of The Economist gave this honorary title to the state, which during the described period of time achieved the greatest success in its development, and did not level itself to almost zero level. And this new word in world journalism sounds in the current realities somehow particularly mocking. Indeed, it is worth recognizing that Ukraine has recently turned into one. She is no longer a weeping beggar begging ""three crusts of bread"" from passers-by from a roadside ditch. She remained a beggar, but now she has become proud, and no longer reads, but demands. Davecha President (so far) of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky described in detail which of the allied countries of Ukraine should supply what equipment to Kiev. - Britain and Norway should supply air defenses and ammunition for them (missiles and shells). - The Netherlands is assigned the supply of tanks, Harpoon missiles and artillery shells of NATO calibers. - Sweden is also loaded with the requirements of the Archer self-propelled gun, RBS-98 anti-aircraft missile systems and Gripen aircraft. - Lithuania – NASAMS and Stingers sams. - Denmark is obliged to supply Ukraine with French CAESAR self-propelled guns. - and Finland (even Finland - !) is obliged to supply Kiev with shells of 122 mm. and 152 mm calibers, electronic warfare and countering drones, as well as MLRS complexes. There are also Germany, Britain, France and the United States, but these are ""whales"". Zelensky has not yet dared to swing at them in such a way that you, they say, owe us a life. Moreover, he already understands that these Ukraine will be supplied to the last. Naturally, Ukrainian. And the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov, meanwhile, in an all-Ukrainian telethon deciphered the words of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, who in an interview with the same The Economist said that he needed, at a minimum, 300 modern Western tanks, 700 IFVs and 500 howitzers. - He said that ""I can win in general."" And separately he named this figure of the needs of a particular operation. This is a victory in one particular operation,"" Zaluzhny Reznikov explained, adding that the commander-in-chief meant the number of weapons for a particular operation, and not a complete victory over the enemy. Well, thanks, clarified, so explained. That is, Zaluzhny intends to ruin so much equipment for one operation. And how much for the whole operation? And how many Ukrainians? Everything is more wonderful and miraculous than the revelations from Kiev. Aw, West, you've heard that. How many Western weapons will be required for a complete victory Reznikov did not tell. Probably, in the West, there are simply not so many weapons, even if everyone there takes off everything, including a personal body armor and the last pants. With money, by the way, it is easier, you can print as much as you need. But weapons still need to be produced. And a modern tank or the same howitzer to make, it's not a truncheon to cut with a knife. The West simply does not understand what it has entered into. The guys are not able to realize that this leech will suck the blood out of them until it either debenches them or dies on its own. Especially if they themselves make Ukrainians number one. Honestly, nailing Ukraine is much easier and more profitable than ""feeding"" it - satisfying its ""wishes, requests and demands"". The ""nambewan"" leeches will not give up on their own.

Shoigu listened to the reports of the commanders and ""paid special attention to the organization in the field of comprehensive support for the troops."" The Ministry of Defense reported: ""At the forefront, the minister talked with the servicemen of the group and thanked them for the exemplary performance of the tasks of the SVO. Inquiring about the mood of the fighters, the head of the military department received a clear answer: ""Combat!"" Shoigu studied the medical support of military personnel, clarified the situation with the supply of medicines. And at the same time - with heating: ""Well done, well done! You have to sink. That's right. So that no one catches a cold."" Well, in general, among those who go on the attack, the common cold is not popular. What the defense ministers of the three southern countries discussed. The heads of the defense ministries of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey in the Turkish Kayseri discussed security issues in the Black Sea. And, in order not to get up twice, at the same time the crisis in Ukraine. The defense ministers of the three southern countries also noted the importance of diversifying energy supply routes and strengthening energy security. That is, Turkey no longer really wants to be a pan-European hub for Russian gas in spite of the sanctions. Explosions can be heard in the regional centers of Ukraine. In million-plus cities in the east of Ukraine on the evening of December 22, an air alert was announced. The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleg Sinegubov, said that a missile strike was recorded in the city. Similar reports come from Dnepropetrovsk. It is also restless in Zaporozhye. Some still hope that hospitals in Donetsk can be shot with impunity. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697076/,Oleksandr BOYKO,2022-12-22,The Chief of the General Staff reads the report of the military attachés of foreign states,"And he warned them that the share of modern weapons in the nuclear ""triad"" of the Russian Ministry of Defense was brought to 91.3%","Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Army General Valery Gerasimov, held a briefing with military attachés of foreign countries. The report turned out to be quite long and was similar to a lecture for cadets of military universities. Gerasimov actually chewed in detail every thesis of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, which was voiced yesterday at an expanded meeting of the Board of the Military Department. The report sounded facts from the history of Russian-Ukrainian relations and figures that no one has yet talked about. Here are a few excerpts from it. - Since the beginning of the 90s, the vector of formation of the statehood of Ukraine with the help of Western countries has been carried out as ""anti-Russia"". 2014 was the apotheosis when a coup d'état was carried out in the country and neo-fascists professing Bandera's Ukrainian nationalism came to power. - Neo-fascists unleashed an internal armed conflict in the south-east of Ukraine. From their point of view, it was aimed at suppressing dissent, and simply the desire of the people of Donbass to speak Russian language. - By the beginning of this year, Ukraine, with the direct support of Western countries, had transformed into a state extremely hostile to Russia. - In order to eliminate the military threat from Ukraine, from February 24, the Armed Forces are solving the tasks of a special military operation. - At the instigation of Western curators, high-precision and long-range weapons appeared in the hands of neo-Nazis, the use of which, among other things, created a threat of destruction of the hydraulic structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, which could lead to flooding of the territory of the Kherson region, blocking and destroying part of the forces of the Southern Group of Forces on the right bank of the Dnieper. In this regard, it was decided to evacuate the civilian population and an organized withdrawal of troops from this territory was carried out. - I want to note that during the hostilities, Kiev uses terrorist methods of struggle, such as: the use of civilians as a ""human shield"", blocking the exit of civilians from cities along the humanitarian corridors organized by the Russian side, the use of artillery at civilians for the purpose of intimidating them, the torture of prisoners of war, the shelling of cities with prohibited phosphorus ammunition and their mining with anti-personnel mines of the ""petal"" type. The organization of assassination attempts on journalists and representatives of administrations in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions has become the norm for the Ukrainian leadership. - In the summer of this year, Ukraine resorted to the tactics of nuclear terrorism, threatening Europe with a nuclear catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Systematic shelling of its territory is carried out almost daily. And only thanks to the competent and effective actions of the units of our Armed Forces to cover the nuclear power plant, it is possible to keep this nuclear facility safe. - Today, the United States and its allies are consistently increasing the volume of military assistance to Kiev to make the conflict protracted. The total foreign financial assistance to Ukraine amounted to almost $ 100 billion. In the supply of weapons, the most significant contribution is made by the United States, Great Britain, Poland and Romania. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, Western countries have handed over to Kiev four aircraft, more than 30 helicopters, over 350 tanks, about 1000 armored personnel carriers, at least 800 armored vehicles, as well as up to 700 artillery systems, 100 units of MLRS, 130 thousand anti-tank weapons, over 5300 MANPADS and at least five thousand UAVs for various purposes. - As part of the operation, high-precision long-range missiles hit more than 1,300 critical targets. This made it possible to significantly reduce the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces, disrupt the command and control system, paralyze the work of the military-industrial complex, and significantly complicate military transportation. For the first time in combat conditions, hypersonic weapons were used. The Kinzhal aircraft missile system has shown high efficiency and invulnerability in relation to air defense systems deployed in Ukraine. Operational-tactical and army aviation performs tasks with high combat intensity, daily making about 150 combat sorties. It destroyed more than 11,000 units of weapons and equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - Unmanned aerial vehicles are actively used to conduct reconnaissance and strike operations. With their help, about eight thousand were opened and more than 600 objects were destroyed. To stabilize the situation, protect new territories and conduct further offensive actions, it was necessary to increase the combat and numerical composition of groups of troops and forces. To this end, a partial mobilization was carried out, during which 300 thousand citizens in the reserve were called up for military service. I would especially like to note the active civic position of the country's population. Without waiting for subpoenas, more than 20,000 people joined the troops as volunteers. - Partial mobilization made it possible to significantly increase the combat capabilities of the troops, increase the combat and numerical composition of formations and units, and create additional reserves. As a result, the groups of troops of the Armed Forces of Russia have intensified hostilities, causing irreparable damage to the enemy in manpower and equipment. They took control of 5 times more territory of Ukraine than previously occupied by the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics. Currently, the line of combat contact stretches for 815 km. Taking into account the measures taken to build up the combat capabilities of the groups of troops, the situation on the front line has been stabilized, the main efforts of our troops are focused on completing the liberation of the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic. In addition, fire damage continues to be inflicted on critical transport and energy infrastructure facilities deep inside the territory of Ukraine, places of storage and storage of fuel and lubricants, missiles and ammunition, weapons and military equipment, as well as operational reserves at temporary deployment points. - NATO's activities continue to have a serious impact on the security situation in Europe. The United States views the Alliance as one of the tools to protect American interests on a global scale, to the detriment of the security of European countries. - Practical steps for the speedy integration of Sweden and Finland into the alliance indicate that under a far-fetched threat from Russia, Washington seeks to bring the NATO bloc as close as possible to our borders by involving new satellites. "" The Alliance's actions only increase tensions and reduce the level of security on the NATO-Russia line of contact. The U.S. and its allies also aim to intensify the geopolitical standoff with Russia in the Arctic. The right of our country to use the Northern Sea Route, which is one of the main challenges to security in the region, is disputed. Along with this, NATO, under the pretext of ""reacting"" to the activities of the Russian Armed Forces in the Arctic, is implementing a set of measures to strengthen the ""northern flank"" of the alliance, conducting an aggressive information campaign accusing Russia of militarizing the Arctic. - In the current situation, the Russian Federation continues its planned activities to strengthen the country's defense capability. During the year, the Armed Forces solved the tasks of increasing combat potential, improving the training of personnel, methods of command and control of troops and weapons, as well as the supply of modern weapons and equipment. In the strategic nuclear forces, re-equipment with modern and promising missile systems, modernization of long-range aircraft continued. The share of modern weapons in the nuclear ""triad"" was brought to 91.3%. In the outgoing year, the necessary measures were taken to increase the combat capabilities of general-purpose forces, including taking into account the experience of the CBO. - The composition and organizational structure of formations and military units was improved. More than 3100 units of armored, missile-artillery and other weapons were supplied to the troops of the military districts, the Northern Fleet and the Airborne Forces. To ensure the security of the Russian Federation, ships of the far and near sea zones are being built from the ocean and sea directions, and the basing system of the Navy is being improved. In order to counter potential threats to the Russian Federation in the aerospace sphere, the country's aerospace defence, based on the Aerospace Forces, is being improved. - Formations and military units of the VKS are equipped with modern aviation complexes and modernized attack helicopters. New systems and radar stations for various purposes are entering service with anti-aircraft missile and radio engineering troops. The capabilities of unmanned aircraft have increased due to the formation of new units and equipping the Armed Forces with modern complexes with reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicles. - In order to strengthen confidence-building measures, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation continues to increase the scale of interaction with foreign partners. Priority is still given to the development of partnership and allied relations with the CIS member states, the development of the military component of the CSTO, as well as the interaction of the defense ministries of the SCO member states. - Next year, work will continue to create conditions for stabilizing the situation at the global and regional levels, as well as the progressive and balanced development of the Army and Navy to ensure the peaceful socio-economic development of the country.

Maybe the Kremlin and the government should somehow regulate this spontaneous process related to the business trips of officials, former or current, I don't know, to Donbass, Kherson region and Zaporozhye? In fact, this process is uncontrolled. Or is this normal, given that everything is happening on our territory? I mean injuries and so on. This is not the first wound.

Peskov answered these questions in some detail. - Look, there are business trips of officials, and this is completely normal. Officials visit Russian regions. And they will visit. Moreover, these are regions that require special attention now, in the transition period, during the period of their integration and adaptation to all the living spaces of our large country.

Delivery of letters to the zone of a special military operation - on the courier and postal communication of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (FPS). Their cars are guarded daily on the front lines. All envelopes and parcels will be handed over personally. Here they understand, sometimes - there is nothing more important than the connection with the house. Fighters are ready to write in response at any opportunity, if there are a few free minutes between combat work - they take up the pens. Exchange offices have been deployed in all groups of troops, where participants can write and leave their letters. Every day, FPS servicemen deliver about a thousand envelopes to military units.

At a press conference following a meeting with the head of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, the head of the White House promised to provide assistance to Kiev until Independence ceases to exist. ""We will stand on the side of Ukraine as long as it exists,"" Biden said, while refraining from predicting how many days, weeks or months remained for this state. However, a few hours later, these promises were broken - the Senate suddenly postponed the vote on a new aid package for $ 45 billion Perhaps Washington has already begun to count the remaining days for Ukraine, as the overseas sponsor praised the head of the independent country who arrived ""for a bow"" for ""openness to achieving a ""just peace"" without territorial concessions. Naturally, on absolutely unacceptable conditions for Russia. That is, in fact, Washington simultaneously pretends to seek peace, but with the other hand gives Kiev the ""go-ahead"" to escalate the conflict with Moscow. Thus, demonstrating to Russia that it is possible to fulfill the goals of the special operation only after the complete overthrow of the puppet regime. After all, as long as Ukraine exists under the rule of Zelensky, Biden will support. He promised. So the real result of Zelensky's meeting with the host was confirmation from Washington: we are ready for any sacrifices from ukrainians indifferent to us in order to achieve strategic goals: to support the dollar by saturating our military industry with money. And to weaken Russia as much as possible during the military conflict. But will it work? A more than eloquent answer was the board of the Ministry of Defense with the participation of Vladimir Putin, where the reform of the Russian army was announced.

This is the first major public event since the beginning of the special operation, where President and Minister Sergei Shoigu discussed in detail the state of the army. The report of the commander-in-chief and the head of the army lasted more than an hour. We have collected their most important statements. - It is well known that today the military potential and capabilities of almost all major NATO countries are actively used against Russia. Nevertheless, our soldiers, sergeants and officers are fighting for Russia courageously and steadfastly, confidently, step by step solving the tasks set. And these tasks will certainly be fulfilled in all territories of Russia, including in the new territories, the safe life of all our citizens will be ensured, the president said at the very beginning, and then announced a minute of silence for the dead. Putin compared the fighters of the special operation with the heroes of the war with Napoleon, the First World War and the Great Patriotic War. - The fighting, of course, has identified issues on which we must work hard. Including those that we have discussed more than once. I mean communications, automated command and control systems for troops and weapons, counter-battery tactics and so on, the head of state listed. The President pointed out that all the practical experience of the military operation should be systematized and used to train new military personnel. And distinguished soldiers and officers ""should be promoted to command positions as a matter of priority."" - I expect that designers and engineers will continue to go to the front line. They regularly visit there, and then make adjustments to new models of equipment,"" the Russian leader said. Putin instructed the Defense Ministry, the government and industrialists to continue to work in one bundle to update equipment and equipment. - We know that there are no trifles on the battlefield. First aid kits, uniforms, dry rations - everything should be at the highest level. It is necessary to saturate the troops with night vision devices, sights. Everything that a fighter needs should be modern and comfortable, reliable,"" he added. The head of state said that 91% of our nuclear triad is equipped with new weapons. The Strategic Missile Forces are already receiving Avangard hypersonic missiles. In the near future, the rocket scientists will receive the Sarmat intercontinental missile. "" In early January next year, the frigate ""Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov"" will enter combat service with the latest, I repeat, having no analogues in the world, sea-based hypersonic missile systems ""Zircon"", - said the supreme. The President instructed to equip the army with a maximum of different drones, starting with strategic and ending with small reconnaissance ones. And every soldier should have access to data from the air. - We have no restrictions on financing. The country gives everything the army asks for. I hope the answer will be properly formulated, and the results will be achieved,"" Putin said. - The partial mobilization has revealed certain problems - this is well known to everyone - which should be promptly addressed. I know that the necessary measures are being taken, but we still need to pay attention to this and build this system in a modern way, the head of state instructed. He asked the Defense Ministry to ""be attentive to civil initiatives, take into account criticism and listen to those who do not hush up problems."" ""There has always been our strength in the unity of the army and the people,"" the president reminded. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke after the Russian leader. He recalled that the West gives Ukraine weapons, advisers and intelligence. - It should be noted that NATO staff officers, artillerymen and other specialists are in the combat zone. More than 500 US and NATO spacecraft are working in the interests of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, of which more than 70 are military, the rest are dual-use, the head of the Ministry of Defense reported. 27 NATO countries have spent $97 billion to support Kiev. Shoigu did not rule out that the weapons could then spread around the world, as already happened after America's flight from Afghanistan. Shoigu said that it is planned to change the age of military service. - When recruiting the Armed Forces, gradually increase the age of conscription of citizens from 18 to 21 years, and raise the limit to 30 years. The army itself should also increase. ""To guarantee the solution of the tasks of ensuring the military security of the Russian Federation, it is necessary to bring the number of armed forces to 1.5 million servicemen, including contract servicemen - up to 695 thousand people,"" the minister suggested. ""I agree with the proposals for further structural changes,"" Putin later replied. All three were listed by Sergei Shoigu. 1. ""Continue the CBO until its tasks are completed."" 2. ""The Russian group of troops must maintain peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and Syria."" 3. ""To increase the number of servicemen under the contract, taking into account the replacement of mobilized citizens in the groups of troops and the recruitment of new formations by the end of the year to 521 thousand people."" - If in February the appropriate actions had not been taken on our part, everything would have been the same, only from the worst positions for us. The situation in Ukraine has been brought by her so-called friends to the point where it has become deadly for Russia and suicidal for the Ukrainian people themselves. And we see this even in the nature of the fighting: it is simply amazing what is happening there, as if Ukrainians do not exist at all, they are thrown into the furnace and that's it,"" Putin said at the end of the open part of the board. - They (the West – Ed.) pursued their interests, weakened and tore historical Russia apart. And today, continuously supplying weapons to Ukraine, transferring mercenaries there, they are absolutely ruthless to its citizens. At their expense, they promote their geopolitical goals, which have nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. Also aimed at weakening, disintegrating, destroying Russia,"" he added. In the end, the president assured that he did not plan to militarize the economy. The improvement of the armed forces will take place ""calmly and rhythmically"", the state will fulfill all social obligations. - We have it all. All the opportunities to build your potential. We will certainly do this without any discounts. And unlike many other countries on its own scientific technological production and personnel base, the head of the country assured. LISTEN AS WELL.

Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Shoot rarely, yes accurately, bayonet koli strongly. A bullet is a fool, a bayonet is a good guy,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And he also warned: ""The uncut forest grows again."" HE TOOK HIS SUBORDINATES OUT OF THE SHELLING. Captain Yuri Kashevaro. ""The motorized rifle battalion, which included the deputy commander for military-political work, Captain Yuri Kashevarov, defended one of the settlements. The enemy, with superior forces supported by heavy armored vehicles, using artillery and mortar fire, attempted to dislodge our soldiers from their positions. During the battle, competently controlling his subordinates, Yuri destroyed two units of armored personnel carriers, two combat vehicles and a large number of enemy manpower. Also during the battle, Yuri, despite the continuing shelling from the enemy, pulled out from under enemy fire comrades who had been wounded, loaded them into a car and took them to a safe area for subsequent evacuation. Thanks to the bold and decisive actions of Captain Kashevarov and his subordinates, it was possible to prevent the breakthrough of the defense line. "" DEFEATED A GROUP OF SABOTEURS. Ensign Alexander MURAVTSE. ""A group of Russian servicemen, which included a paramedic of the company, Ensign Alexander Muratsev, performed special tasks in the area of one of the settlements. Moving along a given route in the forest belt, Alexander noticed a well-armed group of Ukrainian nationalists preparing for sabotage activities in the rear of the Russian troops. Alexander immediately reported to the commander. Having assessed the situation, the commander of our group decided to impose the battle on the enemy. Having destroyed the enemy's firing points with a sudden barrage of fire, the Russian servicemen significantly reduced the combat capabilities of the nationalists. During the battle, acting boldly and decisively, Alexander Muratsev under enemy fire evacuated wounded comrades from under enemy fire, after which he provided first aid. The professional actions of Alexander Muratsev made it possible to save the lives of his comrades."" IDENTIFIED CAMOUFLAGED OBJECTS. Junior Sergeant Pyotr Ilyushi. ""The group under the command of Junior Sergeant Pyotr Ilyushin performed special tasks near one of the settlements occupied by nationalists. Moving along a given route, Junior Sergeant Ilyushin discovered a carefully camouflaged enemy object. Having assessed the situation, Peter decided to attack the enemy's positions. Taking advantage of the fact that the group was not detected by the enemy, Peter ordered to secretly take advantageous positions along the perimeter of the object. On the conditional signal of Junior Sergeant Ilyushin, the group opened a heavy fire on the enemy. During the battle, the enemy, having suffered heavy losses, was forced to retreat. During the inspection of the facility, valuable information was found on it, which was transmitted to the higher command. For the courage and heroism shown in the performance of the task, Junior Sergeant Pyotr Ilyushin was awarded the Suvorov Medal."" LISTEN AS WELL.

Vasyl Malyuk, the acting head of the SBU, once again distinguished himself in words. The 39-year-old brigadier general said in an interview with Natalia Moseychuk, a ""journalist"" as odious as himself, commenting on the situation around the Crimean bridge: ""Based on the analysis of the operational situation, we simply have to cut off the logistics of the enemy there."" Well, when asked about the attempt to blow up this bridge, which occurred on October 8, for which the Ukrainian energy system is still paying, Malyuk replied that he could not comment on it and disclose some details, but ""over time everything will become known."" And so it has long been known what to build an institute. Tbilisi rejects Kiev's diktat. Mamuka Mdinaradze, executive secretary of the ruling Georgian Dream party, said calls from Kiev to release former Georgian President (and ex-governor of the Odessa region) Mikheil Saakashvili for medical treatment outside the republic were a gross interference in its internal affairs. This was the reaction to the statement of the sixth president of the independent country - to release Mishiko, for example, to Ukraine (yes, the situation there is now very conducive to the treatment of ailments). Zelensky remotely issued a diagnosis: the ex-president of Georgia is in serious condition. Mdinaradze reacted harshly: ""When we are urged, relying on a fake campaign and simulations, to make a decision, and this decision cannot be political, but must be taken by the justice system, this is gross interference in our affairs."" Nothing, they will all be cured – many in the coming year. Warsaw will limit aid to refugees from the east. Karolina Kozakevich, a columnist for Gazeta Wyborcza, wrote that during the autumn, the mayor of Przemysl bordering Ukraine, Wojciech Bakun, repeatedly reported that Ukrainians were engaged in extortion of benefits. This information was confirmed by other sources, for example, employees of schools in which children of Ukrainian citizens study. The result is logical. A spokeswoman for the Social Insurance Administration (OSS), Ivona Kovalska-Matis, said that soon the departure of a Citizen of Ukraine from Poland for more than a month will deprive him of the right to legally stay in the country. Well, the right to receive benefits for families ""500+"" is lost. The OSS suspended the issuance of more than 110 thousand benefits. Kowalska-Mathis warned: ""The OSS has access to the border service register used to verify eligibility for benefits"" This is sho tse take: zrada chi peremoga?. At Soledar, Ukrainian mobilizers are trying to abandon the position. Andriy Marochko, an officer of the LPR People's Militia, said that fresh mobilized Ukrainian fighters are not eager to defend Soledar. According to Marochko, yesterday's civilian, and now the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, without waiting for the tightening of measures for disciplinary offenses, began to leave their positions. They run where the eyes look. Including, in the direction of the enemy. This trend intensified after the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny appealed to Zelensky to sign a law on toughening the punishment of the military for disobedience and desertion. Until the law is signed, you need to wash off. In America, they saw nationalism in Ukrainian laws. Michael Docherty, a columnist for National Review, noted that the Kiev regime's laws abolishing Russian culture and language point to nationalism. In particular, he touched upon this topic at one of the American conferences, speaking about the adopted laws of Ukraine banning the publication of Russian-language materials, if they are not accompanied by a translation into Ukrainian. The observer noted that for at least a third of the residents of the independent Ukrainian is not their native language. And, accordingly, the adoption of such laws is an attempt to ""force millions of people to accept Ukrainian culture or cut off from public life."" This conclusion is 8 years late, but better late than never. In Belarus, the border areas with Ukraine were ""dried. Roman Golovchenko, the head of the Government of Belarus, signed a decree according to which the entry, entry, movement and temporary stay in the border strip on the territory of three districts of the Gomel region bordering Ukraine are temporarily restricted. The restrictions will affect the Loyevsky, Bragin and Khoiniki districts. Temporary restrictions do not apply to individuals traveling to the border strip to perform official duties, to the place of residence and back, to the place of residence (stay) of close relatives and back, as well as in exceptional cases with the permission of the Chairman of the State Border Committee of Belarus or an official authorized by him. And that's right, what is there to shasta, at this border, on the other side they drink too much without eating. In the LPR, they can privatize mines. Leonid Pasechnik, the acting head of the LPR, said that coal industry enterprises could be privatized in the republic if they continue to be unprofitable. The analysis of the state of the economy will be carried out jointly with federal bodies. Pasechnik said: ""If the situation does not change, we will start privatization. The main thing is to provide work and decent wages for people."" The head of the republic discussed the systemic problems of the coal industry at a recent meeting with the President of the Russian Federation - and heard a promise to subsidize salaries to employees and the preservation of enterprises. And in Kiev they will no longer sing ""You give the country coal!"". The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing for city battles in Artemovsk. Ukrainian troops are equipping firing points in the homes of residents of Artemovsk (Bakhmut). The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing this settlement for urban battles. In particular, the basements of social facilities are used as warehouses for shells. Artemovsk is an important transport hub for supplying the Ukrainian group of troops in the Donbas. And this knot has to be untied. Or rather, cut... The United States will not send its troops to Ukraine. Joe Biden will not send American troops to help Kiev (despite the tearful requests of Zelensky, who flew to Washington to strengthen assistance). A senior White House official said, ""The president has not hesitated and will not hesitate tomorrow, a month from now, or a year from now that the U.S. will not send troops into Ukraine to fight the Russians directly."" The US authorities after the start of the military operation in Ukraine have repeatedly stressed that they will not send the military to the conflict zone. Instead, Washington sent Kiev several batches of military aid - - - for $ 24 billion. And he will send more. American gun barons demand sacrifices. Kiev will be given the coveted ""Patriots. The next package of military assistance to Ukraine was told by the Secretary of State of the President of the United States Anthony Blinken. Kiev will receive weapons, ammunition and other military equipment worth $ 1.8 billion, including a Patriot missile defense battery and ammunition for it. Depending on the configuration, the battery has four or eight launchers for 16 or 32 missiles, respectively. As well as a radar station, a control point and an impressive outfit of auxiliary equipment. Up to 100 people can serve this farm. Where in Ukraine at the same time as the ""Patriots"" will appear such a number of trained personnel is an open question. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4696545/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-20,Our locomotive is flying forward,How does an armored train that performs special tasks of the SVO work?,"The fact that Russian armored vehicles on railway traction began active work in the zone of a special military operation became known in early March 2022. Back on March 7, video information appeared about how our armored train is calmly and confidently working in the southern direction of the SVO. He then helped in the evacuation of civilians, moved in the zone of Melitopol. At that time, the usual passenger train took citizens of foreign countries towards the Crimea by rail, and the Russian armored train covered this departure, ensuring the safety of hundreds of people. Time has passed. Some tasks have been adjusted. But the main goal of those who work under the cover of armor on the rails remained the same. They should help to ensure the safety of those who perform the main tasks of the CBO on a daily basis. Yes, this updated armored train has sufficient armored coverage. Yes, the main, possibly vulnerable parts of the composition tied to steel lines are protected to the right extent here. On the platforms there are weapons of different types. Along the entire train, equipment and firepower are competently placed. Proper shelters are equipped to fire and repel enemy attacks both from the ground and from the air. Of course, the question arises - what kind of equipment is the special train equipped with? Engineers and developers respond as follows: the latest technology, which is designed for technical reconnaissance and mine clearance. And also for the restoration of partially destroyed railway tracks, plus small artificial structures with not the most serious damage. The locomotive of the armored train is located approximately in the middle of the train. Why is this done? To exclude the possibility of disabling the locomotive with the first blow of the enemy. In the tail and in the head of the composition are placed armor capsules. Those who serve on an armored train have small arms of all types, ranging from an assault rifle to a heavy machine gun. It is armed with an anti-aircraft gun for the destruction of air and ground targets. The main caliber is a twin 23-millimeter gun. Equipped with positions for snipers. Since the main task of the special armored train remains to ensure the safety of military echelons with various cargoes, personnel and equipment, today it regularly moves forward, studying the route. A team of drivers of such a train is ready to instantly respond to any threats. For example, they can accelerate quite sharply in the event of a surprise attack by the enemy. But basically, an armored train follows its steel path not very fast - it does not have the task of setting speed records. And in front of each bridge and overpass, it certainly makes the necessary stop. The armored train dies down for a while, bristling with barrels. And the soldiers of the mine-demolition platoon move forward. They are covered by arrows from the head platforms. Fighters check the condition of the embankment. Carefully inspect the fences. They visually study the bridge supports - whether there are any explosive devices there. There is insurance - this is a special installation on an armored train. It suppresses the signals of radio-controlled landmines. In general, in case of a possible explosion of a steel highway, a special platform always goes ""in the head"". And by the way, it ensures the safety of traffic not only of military echelons. It should be noted that, if necessary, a special train of the Railway Troops of the Western Military District can become a reliable cover for trains with a civilian population. That is, our armored train has already left its spare track. And it's moving in the right direction..."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4696541/,Nikita MAKARENKOV,2022-12-20,Word of the Year - Patronage,"Russian regions, which took under the tutelage of the cities and districts of the DPR, have done a great job","In May of this year, by decision of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, Russian regions began to take patronage over the districts and cities of Donbass. The Pioneer was the Samara Region: the Samara authorities signed a patronage agreement with the city of Snezhnoye. For six months, Samara specialists have already put in order more than 80 objects here. Now 56 Russian regions are already patronizing the settlements of Donbass. According to the Deputy Chairman of the DPR Government Yevgeny Solntsev, a total of 1456 facilities were repaired and rebuilt in the republic by the forces of the chef regions. Among them are 101 schools and 81 kindergartens. ""Among the large facilities are the medical center, which the Ministry of Defense built in 84 days, the center of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, which was also built unprecedentedly quickly, the Nevsky residential quarter in Mariupol,"" Solntsev said. The deputy chairman of the government of the republic identified several regions-chiefs, which especially distinguished themselves by restoring the DPR. - First of all, I would like to thank Moscow for the colossal work that Muscovites are doing in Donetsk. Heating in our houses is thanks to them, - said Evgeny Solntsev. - The leading region is also the Moscow region. From there, most people work for us. Today it is eight thousand people. Solntsev stressed that the Tula region also fulfilled all the planned priority plans: specialists from Tula commissioned apartment buildings and a kindergarten in Mariupol. The Magadan region has made a beautiful memorial square in Zhdanovka. Residents of Yamal rebuilt a modern school in Volnovakha. - We set priorities for the chef regions, asked to make five mandatory projects: a school, a kindergarten, a hospital, a sports facility and a cultural one, as well as engineering networks. And then they helped us more and took more objects,"" says the deputy chairman of the DPR government. - Many specialists want to return to Donbass, many do not leave, extend the business trip. Both workers and engineering and technical staff. The volume of construction in the DPR is colossal, it not only does not stop, but also gains momentum. Now the program of work for 2023 is being formed. It is already known that next year two large significant facilities will be ready - a medical and biological center in Mariupol and a perinatal center in Donetsk. Specialists from the chef regions work in the DPR almost around the clock. So, more than 400 builders from the Chuvash Republic are now working in Mariupol. They are putting in order 14 damaged houses. ""Now the houses have heating, the thermal circuit has been closed - ahead of the work on providing residents with water, gas, electricity and other necessary amenities,"" said Pavel Danilov, Minister of Construction, Architecture and Housing and Communal Services of the Chuvash Republic. - In the coming year, it will be necessary to bring the facades into proper condition, and the territories adjacent to the houses will need to be landscaped. Residents are grateful to the builders from Chuvashia for the work done. - It was a very difficult situation, the windows were all broken, it was cold. And then the guys came to us, and we felt warm and good. We're excited! - says a resident of one of the restored houses. The Kursk region, which, like the Donbass, is itself under the shelling of Ukraine, was not left aside. Kuryans are now repairing 12 buildings in Mariupol: nine residential buildings, two polyclinics and a building for an X-ray room. ""Roofing works, connection to the heating system, replacement of doors and windows are being carried out,"" the regional administration said. According to the Governor of the region Roman Starovoit, school No. 2 was opened in the village of Mangush of the Pervomaisky district after major repairs. Here, the chickens replaced the roof, windows and doors, repaired the facade, landscaped the adjacent territory. ""Also, work was carried out in the assembly hall, major repairs were made in the catering unit and kitchen equipment was installed,"" Starovoit said. - Furniture was bought in the offices, and equipment was bought in the gym, a sports complex was installed on the site. The building was equipped with a fire protection system and panic buttons. For the historical buildings of Mariupol affected by the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Lipetsk region took over. Among the attractions that lipchans will restore is the ""House with Lions"": a Modern mansion located in the city center. Also, the chefs will transform the six-story house built opposite the City Garden in 1937. But these are not the only facilities where Lipchans work. They will also have to restore 27 residential buildings, a kindergarten, a school and a technical lyceum. - Thank you to everyone who is involved in the revival of our city. It's changing for the better every day. We employ a lot of builders from different cities of Russia, - says a resident of Mariupol Svetlana Marchenkova. - I found out that the former view will return and historical sights, of course, this is gratifying. After all, this is history, and it is rich in our country, it must be preserved. In the Amvrosievsky district, the Amur Region took up roads that had not been repaired for decades. In a short time, the coating of 16 intra-city roads with a total length of 30 kilometers was put in order. Also, thanks to the Amur Region in Amvrosievka, on the basis of school No. 6, the first educational space in the DPR ""Point of Growth"" will be opened, where children will be able to play chess and robotics, gain knowledge in the field of new technologies and realize their creative potential. - The contractor has already completed the dismantling of structures and interior decoration in two offices and a corridor. The opening of the educational site is scheduled for February next year, - said the head of the Amvrosievsky district Igor Lyzov. And the Amur Region is restoring the Novoambrosievsk school. The educational institution was built in 1953, and since then the heating system in it has never been changed. Amur residents replaced more than 300 batteries and pipes in the school, and updated the roof. It remains to carry out internal repairs. - The Amur Region performed the work brilliantly, - commented the director of the Novoambrosievsk school Natalia Minasyan. - The building is warm and dry, which can not but rejoice. We were also given laptops and sports equipment. Many thanks to our chef region. KSTAT. Recently, the head of the Republic of Tyva Vladislav Khovalyg came to the DPR. In one of the local hospitals, he visited Tuvan medical volunteers who came to Donbass to help residents. ""As part of the landing of Tuvan doctors, there is an operating nurse, a paramedic-anesthetist, a surgeon, an endoscopist surgeon, two orthopedic traumatologists and two anesthesiologists-resuscitators,"" said The Chairman of the DPR Government Vitaly Khotsenko, who accompanied the head of Tuva. - With them, the doctors brought all the most necessary things that can be useful for saving the life and health of people. Khovalyg also visited the Yenakiieve Metallurgical Plant, where an agreement on cooperation in the field of economy and industrial development was concluded. - The development of relations between the republics in the spheres of culture, sports and social areas will continue. It is important that our teachers, doctors and athletes have the opportunity to exchange experience and discover new corners of our vast Russia, - said Vitaly Khotsenko."

At least eight dead civilians, 20 seriously wounded, about 50 wounded. Zelensky immediately issued a statement, accusing Russia of another ""crime"". But, as you know, the Russian army, unlike the Armed Forces of Ukraine, does not purposefully hit civilians and, in general, still tries to avoid strikes on the neighborhoods of Ukrainian cities, even when Ukrainian soldiers place military equipment in the courtyards. As for this case, there are very significant reasons to believe that it was the Armed Forces of Ukraine that struck their Kherson from the American MLRS ""Highmars"". This is proved by traces from the arrival of striking elements in a car in Kherson. As if neatly carved circles with small compasses indicate the use of these MLRS with striking elements in the form of balls. This is proved by the striking elements, and traces of them in cars in Donetsk, where ""chimeras"" arrive day after day. And photos of the use of these missiles abroad, in other countries, in particular, in the Arab East, etc. But in Russian missiles that are used in Ukraine, the striking elements have a cylindrical shape or are parallelepipeds with a square cross-section. It turns out that Zelensky's army itself shelled the city, which it officially considers its own. She killed her own citizens, and now this whole bunch of scoundrels and scumbags in Kiev with foam from the mouth accuses Russia of this. What blames Russia is commonplace. But why would they shoot at those they call their own. And this is also nothing new. This is also a tradition of the ""Ukrainian lykdom"". Let's recall how the mayor of Kiev Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko demonstrated the striking elements from the missile that flew into the house in the capital of Ukraine, and how then removed this photo of his palm when it turned out that he had in his hand the striking elements of the outdated Missiles of the Ukrainian air defense, which in Russia had long been removed from service. Let's remember how the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled Izyum (when it was occupied by the Russian military) and even Kharkov. And the worse the arrival at the railway station of Kramatorsk of the Ukrainian rocket ""Tochka-U"", which was also accompanied by a large number of victims among the civilian population. They were even able to photograph the body of the missile with the serial number, which indisputably proved that the missilemen of the Ukrainian army made a strike on their own. What for? The answer is simple – they need a picture for the West, for sponsors, to intensify attention to Ukraine in the world, to form once again the ""right"" view and the ""right"" public opinion. And in order to solve these problems and achieve their goals, they do not feel sorry for their Ukrainians at all. Moreover, for Kiev, the inhabitants of these regions, at least, are not quite their own, and even more precisely, they are not at all their own. And even if they are former, but pro-Russian. Kiev is ready to kill tens of thousands of such potentially ""wrong"" Ukrainians if it helps Zelensky an additional billion or at least a tank company. And those who do not die under his missiles, Zelensky will send (and send) to die for him in the trenches. Therefore, we must not forget to add to the series of crimes of the Ukrainian leadership against Donbass and Russia the crimes of ""Zelensky and company"" and against their own country and its civilian population.

This is the complex ""Saur-Mogila"" known throughout the country - the legendary mound and strategic height in the Donetsk People's Republic. This is the monument ""Unconquered"", dedicated to the feat of the heroes-young guards. As well as the memorial ""Prince Igor"" in the Lugansk People's Republic. - The results are impressive. I am talking, first of all, about the role in the rapid restoration of the ""Saur-grave"". On behalf of the President of Russia, the RVIO carried out this work in record time, - said Denis Pushilin, Acting Head of the Donetsk People's Republic. Now there is a plan to build the second stage of the Memorial ""Saur-Mogila"", the pantheon of military glory, and the reconstruction of the monument on the site of the pit of the mine 4/13 bis, where the Nazis executed and buried the fighters against Nazism during the Great Patriotic War. The speed and quality of the work of RVIO specialists was also highly appreciated by the head of the LPR Leonid Pasechnik. - For four months, a lot has been done at the memorial ""Unconquered"": the foundation of the monument has been stabilized and cracks have been eliminated, the Alley of Commemorative Plates with photos of the Young Guards has been landscaped. This memorial is an iconic place for every resident of the republic. During the Great Patriotic War, the feat of the ""young guardsmen"" inspired the entire Soviet people to struggle and victory. Today, according to the leader of the Luhansk region, his countrymen also defend their right to a peaceful life and freedom, like the heroes of the ""Young Guard"" 80 years ago. - The restoration of the memorial ""Prince Igor"" near the village of Luhanska, where 8 years ago the militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were stopped, deserves respect for the specialists who worked there. In fact, they worked in combat conditions. Four times this mound was cleared near the Seversky Donets. And each time they found more and more ammunition. Our restorers did not have any problems, but in the immediate vicinity there were six explosions on the ""petals,"" said Nikolai Ovsienko, deputy head of the RVIO. At a press conference held in the TASS news agency, he also said that about a thousand monuments and obelisks were destroyed in the Donbas during shelling from the Ukrainian side - this was the state policy of the current Kiev regime.

He used, among other things, the information of the acting head of the SBU Vasyl Malyuk. Medvedev drew attention to the report of the Ukrainian TV channel, where Malyuk said about ""working behind enemy lines of women agents of the SBU"" who had plastic surgery. The data that escorts born in Ukraine and fishing in Russia are involved as informants of the SBU in 2022 were confirmed from various sources. Baba on the ship is always unfortunate. The British tv channel Sky News compared satellite images of the independent in January and December 2022. NASA Suomi and NOAA-20 satellites fly over Ukraine and shoot the pulse of the country. This is the light of street lights, shop signs, residential buildings. In the January images, the territory of the independent is brightly illuminated. In December, it is gloomy, like Zelensky's dreams. A Sky News report said: ""The two satellites have transmitted high-resolution images and they show how much that pulse has weakened."" A detailed analysis of the images shows that at the end of November, Ukraine's energy system became almost completely faulty. Yes, it happens when you laugh at the explosions of bridges and hospitals somewhere in the south and east. The sixth president of Ukraine, speaking to the ambassadors, named 8 main tasks of Ukrainian diplomacy for the coming year. The primary goals of the tragicomic consider negotiations on the accession of the independent in the European Union, preparations for the summit of the North Atlantic Alliance, ensuring the country's defense needs and the supply of weapons from allied countries. Sad about the state of energy in the country, Zelensky demanded that ambassadors work ""as closely as possible with the government, the office, international organizations and partner states"" to achieve results. In the Russian direction, he demanded to strengthen work on the imposition of sanctions, the organization of a tribunal in connection with a special operation and the blocking of assets. He also called the support of Ukrainians around the world important. So he said: ""Work to ensure that our people return to the state and all their rights and legitimate interests in the host countries are satisfied."" Well, with such a leader, Ukrainians will definitely not disappear. Or they will disappear. But that's not accurate. In Donetsk, the Voroshilov Interdistrict Court extended the term of arrest of 19 soldiers of the regiment ""Azov"" * (banned in Russia). They are accused of activities in an organization recognized as terrorist. With regard to another dozen militants, the court will consider a petition to extend the arrest on December 26. The investigation of cases of war crimes against 70 Ukrainian soldiers and the Azov battalion has been completed. All of them are accused of committing war crimes against civilians. They are planned to be tried in Donetsk. Well, where else - not in Kiev? Though... On the Hungarian-Ukrainian border, they tried to drag a multi-purpose Ka-26 helicopter. According to the channel ""Politics of the Country"", they tried to import the car using forged documents. They dragged her in an open semi-trailer truck. Inconsistencies in the official papers on the turntable were suddenly discovered by vigilant Ukrainian border guards at the Tisza crossing. In particular, information about the manufacturer turned out to be false. The car, the cost of which is estimated at one million hryvnias, was seized. Well, in Odessa in the port with the MI-2 helicopter there was already something similar - and how did it end? All according to Zhvanetsky - and now let's hear from the head of the transport workshop. Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree on admission to citizenship of the country. More than 7300 Ukrainians received Belarusian citizenship in a year and a half. Of these, more than 4200 this year. These are the data of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Lives in the Belarusian Polesie sorceress of the forest - Olesya. The court in Ukraine sentenced the famous singer Denis Maidanov in absentia to 15 years in prison. And also to the confiscation of property. And all this - for the ""encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability"" of the independent. According to the SBU, Maidanov on February 15 supported the resolution on appealing to the president with a request to recognize the independence of the LPR and the DPR. A week later, as a deputy of the lower house of the Russian parliament, he voted for the ratification of the treaties ""on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance"" between Russia and the republics of Donbass. For which he was sentenced under Part 3 of Art. 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine to the maximum. Yeah, I guess he's already drying crackers and picking the cat. China's new ambassador to the European Union, Fu Cong, said that the United States does not want to see an end to the military conflict in Ukraine. Why? Yes, because they ""profit from this crisis."" The ambassador said: ""The main thing is to stop the fighting, to achieve a ceasefire to save lives, and we will support all efforts in this regard. We know that some countries or some people in certain states don't want an end to the feud. And we don't think that's right."" He added: ""We know who is profiting from this crisis. Who sells a huge number of weapons. And who benefits from the energy crisis that European countries have experienced."" Yes, we also know this, but we will not tell anyone. Taras Melnychuk, the representative of the Ukrainian government in the Verkhovna Rada, said that the Cabinet of Ministers independently approved the withdrawal from the agreement with Belarus on air traffic. Already in the spring, the Ukrainian authorities began to denounce the agreements with Belarus. Kiev broke agreements with Minsk on industrial and scientific-technical cooperation of enterprises and organizations of the defense industry, on cooperation in the field of youth policy, in the field of geodesy, cartography and remote sensing of the Earth. Agreements on scientific cooperation with the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus have been terminated. The agreement on cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes was terminated. Sail, torn sail - I repent, I repent, I repent... ""Azov""* - *Banned in Russia terrorist organization. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"

The Lieutenant General noted that in the Krasno-Limansky direction in the areas of the Medvezhye tract, as well as the Serebryansky forestry in the Luhansk People's Republic, two sabotage and reconnaissance groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed, and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles were burned along the entire contact line.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697681/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-22,Satan rules the roost there,"In Ukraine, they decided to finally deal with the Orthodox Church","- Dear parishioners! In connection with the latest events, all baptismal rites conducted by priests of the UOC are canceled! You can sign up for a second baptism in the OCU with the priest - such announcements were full of churches in Ukraine just the other day. And it's more than just symptomatic. Because in The Independent State they set a course for the complete destruction of the only canonical Orthodox denomination in this territory - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate - UOC-MP). And the war was declared not only by schismatics looking at parishes and hungry for treasures, who are a dime a dozen in Ukraine, but also by the state that joined them. And at the head of the ""anti-cross"" satanic campaign stood the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. ""The Kiev regime led by Zelensky, on which there is no cross, is leading the split of Orthodoxy in Ukraine,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in her telegram channel. And - a very rare case - this time Maria Vladimirovna was mistaken. Because the split of Orthodoxy in Ukraine was started by Zelensky's predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, who during his presidency, together with the Patriarch of Constantinople, a former officer of the Turkish army (being a Greek by birth - !) Bartholomew, established the so-called new Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). And Zelensky has now moved to the final stage of the schism - the destruction of the Orthodox Church itself. To the delight of Satanists around the world. However, about the latter a little later. And now about the Satanists who are now ruling their bloody trizna in Ukraine. Even when soldiers from the Ukronazi formation ""Azov"" (banned in Russia by the decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation) surrendered in Mariupol, many noted the abundance of tattoos with satanic symbols on their bodies (one of them is in the photo in the center). And these are not just pictures, but belonging or readiness to belong, as religious experts and psychologists believe, to submit to the ""enemy of the human race."" Polish mercenaries are quite open and proud of this, filming phones on camera, burning the Orthodox Gospel and other religious books in the fire. The Ukrainian military dance a ""white dance"" with an image of the crucified Christ carved out of cardboard. And this is a mockery not only of Orthodoxy, but of all of Christianity, regardless of denominations. It's no secret that the Ukrainian military and the current Kiev regime are strongly supported by both the church of Satan, officially registered in the United States, and the British Satanists, whose number over the past 10 years has grown in the UK by one and a half times (and this is only according to official data). And the behavior of the hierarchs of this new SCU does not fit into the norms of Christian morality. Its leader, Metropolitan Epiphanius (in the world Serhiy Dumenko), in order to take his current post, deceived and betrayed his mentor and leader - the head of the schismatic UOC of the Kiev Patriarchate Filaret, which was not recognized by anyone from the canonical churches. All the evil spirits gathered in Ukraine united to destroy the real Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and its own leaders, as luck would have it, were unable to resist the evil spirits by the compromisers and collaborators obedient to the Zelensky regime, who now in Ukrainian traditions are confusedly asking: ""Are we for the scho?"" Perhaps they were frightened that criminal cases were initiated against 23 priests of the UOC from March to October for ""treason and separatism.""  and dozens of clerics were beaten and ostracized. Unlike the leaders of the UOC, many priests, including in Western Ukraine, urged the flock not to move to the schismatic ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"" - because sooner or later ""everything political will go away"", and people need to remain honest before God. But the hierarchs of the UOC seem to have preferred worldly goods, having lost their Christian fortitude. For normal people, they could still cause pity or sympathy, but for the evil spirits gathered under the guise of a kind of ""other Christianity"" and the Nazi state power, by their helplessness, they cause only joy. Satan triumphed in Ukraine. EXPERT OPINION. It is not for nothing that on the bivouac of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the positions left by them, our fighters often find artifacts of Satanists, objects for their rites, relevant literature, posters. In the videos, those fighting on the other side burn the Gospel at the stake, remember the ""black sun"", and portraits of Hitler, and fascist flags, and even discovered altars of Satanists. Archpriest Alexander Novopashin, a specialist in occult and satanic sects, explained not just the appearance, but also the stimulation of Satanists in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: ""There are no restrictions for a Satanist. Not in relation to prisoners, not in relation to the civilian population, not even in relation to the so-called twins. At the heart is service to evil and the shedding of human sacrificial blood. No moral restraints, no moral brakes. Anything is possible, because the only thing of value is the will of the doer. Someone else's life is of no value in comparison."" - Satanists have a desire to have dominion over others. Their goal is to bind everyone to a common crime and a common blood. And everything is arranged in such a way that yesterday's killers themselves then become victims. They destroy each other, it is inevitable,"" the expert continued. And it is clear that Zelensky now needs just such an armed herd, unencumbered neither by Orthodoxy nor by any ethical norms. And then, then he hopes he'll come up with something. In the meantime, they must kill and destroy everyone and everything without any conscience. It is clear that sooner or later they will kill each other. How one such ""warrior of light"" killed his family (wife and young children) in Ternopil, ""seeing"" in the coloring of a children's inflatable trampoline the color of the ""Russian flag"". But we just don't have time to wait for them to kill each other there. Because first they'll try to do it to us."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697642/,Anatoly VASILIEV,2022-12-22,In the liberated Rubezhnoye - good news,"In the liberated city, gas supply to residential buildings has been fully restored","In the liberated Boundary Holiday. Recently, Luganskgaz specialists connected 100 percent of the residential buildings of Rubezhne, as well as Varvarovka and Kudryashovka, to the gas supply system. The supply of natural gas was restored for five thousand private and apartment buildings. -You have no idea what a joy it is for us when you can quickly and comfortably cook food,"" Irina Polyakova, a resident of Rubezhny, shared her good mood. - A few days before that, gas guys came, checked the serviceability of pipes and hoods in the apartment and in the whole house. Now we're back with the gas. In addition, it will be several times cheaper than in Ukraine. Double joy. The Rubezhnovsky Interdistrict Department of The Gas Sector said that the result was preceded by a long and time-consuming work. After all, in the liberated territories of the republic, as a result of shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, many sections of the main, supply and distribution networks were severely damaged. ""Our specialists have eliminated many damages on street gas pipelines, completely examined underground networks,"" said Valery Kagala, head of the local gas department. One of the most difficult was the repair work on the supply gas pipeline with a diameter of 273 mm near the village of Yuzhny. More than 30 meters of pipe had to be replaced there. And before that, work was carried out to repair the damaged sections of the main gas pipeline Lugansk - Lysychansk - Rubezhne. During the inspection of the highway, experts found several depressurized places formed as a result of shelling. After demining the adjacent territory, Luhanskgaz employees began reconstruction. Pavel Vodolazsky, head of the line and maintenance service of the main gas pipeline management, said that the work was carried out in difficult weather conditions and did not stop even during the beginning of the shelling. - Our specialists steadfastly and courageously perform the tasks. We understand that, except for us, there is no one to do this work, and therefore we bring what we started to the end. The main goal is to provide the long-awaited gas to nearby settlements,"" Vodolazsky said. The restoration of the main gas pipeline Lugansk - Lysychansk - Rubezhne will allow in the future to begin work on the resumption of natural gas supply to residents of the cities of Zolote and Gorske, as well as the villages of Orekhove and Novoivanivka. Earlier, in mid-November, Luhanskgaz employees restored gas supply to 80 percent of apartment buildings in the city of Severodonetsk. More than 14 thousand subscribers got the opportunity to use gas. Recall that the most serious destruction during the liberation of the territory of the LPR fell on the most urbanized settlements of the Severodonetsk agglomeration - Lysychansk, Rubezhne and Severodonetsk. Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Marat Khusnullin said that a master development plan will be developed for these cities following the example of Mariupol."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697636/,Nikita MAKARENKOV,2022-12-22,Champions for the children of Novorossiya,Leading athletes rallied around residents of new regions of Russia,"""United Russia"" and ""Young Guard"" launched the project ""Champions to the children of Donbass"" in new regions of the country. The project will be implemented in Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. The first event within its framework was held in Shakhtersk. State Duma deputy, champion of Russia and the world in boxing Dmitry Pirog held a master class in boxing for children. The outstanding athlete recalled that the project ""Champions for Children"" was born in the Krasnodar Territory with the support of the Accessible Sport Charitable Foundation. - We decided to continue this work together with the Young Guard. In Donbass, the Boxing Federation is joining the project, - said Dmitry Pirog. - Today it is extremely important for residents of the liberated territories that have become part of Russia to create all conditions for a full life in the shortest possible time. The herald of peace and return to it at all times was sport. In order for life to quickly enter a peaceful course, it is necessary to saturate e. Athletes are grateful to the boxer for the advice and experience that they received after the master class. The guys say that for them communication with Dmitry Pirog was very useful. - Of course, he succumbed to me, but I also tried to work well. This is an experience that will be remembered for a long time. It was hard, but I realized that I need to be more liberated in order to spread out more, - says the young athlete Egor. - He gave me advice that I should not reach for myself after a blow, but quickly return it to its place. It was scary at first because I didn't know his power, and then it was normal. I felt a very powerful charisma, strength. It shows that he is a champion and he can defeat anyone, - the athlete Oleg shares his impressions. Not without gifts. The champion of Russia and the world in boxing brought new sports equipment to the sports schools of the Donetsk People's Republic. - We brought with us balls for various sports, wrestling mats and mannequins, tatami mats, table tennis tables, boxing bags and pears, gloves and helmets, football and volleyball nets and racks, weightlifting equipment and other types of equipment. In addition, the Boxing Federation of the Krasnodar Territory handed over building materials for the restoration of one of the boxing halls in Donetsk, - said Dmitry Pirog. After the master class and sparring in Shakhtersk, the regulations of the project ""Champions for the Children of Donbass"" were signed. It will be implemented in several directions - competitions, demonstration performances, master classes, charity matches, communication. ""It is a great honor for us to participate in the project. We pay great attention to this. Sambo and boxing sections have already been opened in Mariupol, and we regularly hold football competitions. We will hold master classes with the participation of eminent athletes, as well as competitions for the Young Guard Cup,"" said Vladimir Sbitnev, MGER coordinator for the UFO, head of the Tyumen regional branch."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697607/,Ivan GRACHEV,2022-12-23,It will be difficult for Ukraine to regain territory: Americans praise Russian General Surovikin and make a forecast for the winter campaign,Observers of The New York Times praised the tactics of General Surovikin during the SVO,"The influential American newspaper New York Times made a forecast for the winter military campaign in Ukraine. Naturally, by interviewing experts associated with the army, intelligence agencies and the US government. Some calculations of this forecast surprise with their cynicism, but it is undoubtedly worth reading them. To understand how they see the course of the Ukrainian conflict in the West and what they are plotting next. Here are quotes from the New York Times. The conflict in Ukraine will soon be in its second year. And its course is likely to change in the coming months as Russia improves its defenses and pushes more soldiers to the front lines, making it harder for Ukraine to regain the vast swathes of territory it lost, U.S. government sources say. This makes the most likely scenario of winter battles a stalemate - neither side will be able to capture much land, despite fierce fighting. Over the past 6 months, Ukrainian forces have reclaimed a plot of land near Kharkiv and taken control of Kherson, a major southern city. But it came at a high price: thousands of dead Ukrainian soldiers and a huge amount of ammunition. Ukraine fired far more shells per week than the U.S. could produce in a month. Senior Ukrainian officials have warned of the possibility of a major Russian offensive. But U.S. experts say Russia does not yet have the strength for a serious offensive. At the same time, the Ukrainian political and military leadership says that they themselves are planning an offensive against Russia. They believe that they need to succeed in order to rebuild critical territories. And their main focus will be on the south. However, U.S. sources believe that Ukraine will likely not be able to reach Crimea with its army and will instead rely on more covert operations like the one on the Kerch Strait bridge. Ukraine has relied in recent months on U.S. intelligence reports to indicate where the Russian military is weakest. The offensive near Kharkov in September was successful because Ukrainians faced empty territories unprepared by Russian forces for defense. According to the US military, they continue to look for fragile places in Russian positions that may not deter an offensive from Ukraine. Still, Kiev's ability to strike effectively at Russian bases and supply lines is not enough to dislodge Moscow's troops from the parts of the country where they are now concentrated. Any small breakthroughs by Ukrainian forces in the coming months are unlikely to defeat the Russian army, U.S. officials say. U.S. officials say there is evidence that Moscow is beginning to learn from mistakes. At the head of the special operation was put General Sergei Surovikin, who, according to American experts, more effectively conducts complex military operations. Ukrainian military officials say Moscow has launched more intense airstrikes on their defensive lines in recent weeks, leading to increased casualties among Ukrainians. And as unfortunate as Russia's partial mobilization initially seemed, 300,000 reservists are now on the defensive lines. And by spring, they will only strengthen, U.S. officials said. Russian troops are digging in, building trenches, and they are abandoning areas that require too many troops to hold, instead moving to safer positions. The withdrawal from Kherson, according to U.S. officials, is a key example of how Russia has learned its lessons. General Surovikin insisted on its necessity. The withdrawal allowed Russian troops to use the Dnieper River for protection. According to these U.S. officials, General Surovikin has managed to improve defenses and discipline Russian troops. And their current offensive in Bakhmut is also aimed at taking better positions to defend against Ukrainian attacks. ""It's gaining ground and trying to build a network of trenches and a smarter set of checkpoints,"" says Dara Massicot, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation. General Surovikin also experimented with new tactics for the Russian Air Force, including how it launches missiles at Ukraine to try to confuse its air defenses. The conflict is increasingly dependent on ammunition and stockpiles of equipment, two basic needs that can address the course of the conflict on both sides.

The children are examined by a pediatrician, neurologist, surgeon, ophthalmologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, traumatologist-orthopedist, otorhinolaryngologist, obstetrician-gynecologist, endocrinologist and cardiologist. If doctors are alarmed by something, they send the patient for additional diagnostics. And some are immediately sent for treatment to other hospitals in the country. In November and December, inspections are carried out in the Melitopol and Berdyansk districts. Doctors come to the children in kindergartens, schools and colleges.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697590/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-22,Kiev was afraid of this winter - and it came,"Allied troops continue to squeeze the Armed Forces of Ukraine out of Donbass and other sectors of the front, and there are objective reasons for this","Our armed forces continue to advance in various directions in the zone of special military operation. Including in the Donetsk direction. What does the Ministry of Defense report in its next report? Read carefully. - In the Donetsk direction, Russian units continued offensive operations. Our troops drove the enemy out of the fortified strongholds. During the day, more than 50 Ukrainian servicemen, two infantry fighting vehicles, an armored personnel carrier and three pickup trucks were destroyed in this direction. This message was about December 10, 2022. Earlier it was reported that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are advancing in the Krasno-Limansky direction. They are regaining their positions, partly lost after the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region last September. Despite the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried now and then to conduct reconnaissance by combat in the Starobilsk direction, using mainly their territorial defense detachments, mobilized and border guards, leaving the most combat-ready units in the rear, this did not prevent the Russian Armed Forces from occupying several enemy strongholds. Due to the constant offensive advance of Russian troops in this direction, the nationalists are forced to constantly transfer reinforcements here. They are trying to equip new observation posts and firing positions. In the Liman sector, the Allied forces established control over two strongholds in the Area of Ploschanka. Also, fighting continues in the gray zone on the Krasnopopovka - Makiivka border. In the Lisichansk sector, the fighters of the allied units established control over the observation post in the area of Belogorovka. Units of the 122nd battalion of the 81st separate airmobile brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were forced to retreat to replenish personnel in Serebryanka. Even Kiev is forced to admit that ""the Armed Forces of Ukraine have lost the momentum of the offensive."" Or simply put, they turn back. The reports of their Ukrainian capital say that the Russian Armed Forces seized the initiative. This was pointed out through his teeth by the adviser to the office of President Vladimir Zelensky, Alexei Arestovich. In Mark Feigin's program, this walking mouthpiece of the Kiev regime admitted that ""on the ground along the entire front line there is a phase of operational and tactical pressure of Russian troops in all directions."" Earlier, the telegram channel ""Resident"", citing a source in the office of the Ukrainian president, said that ""Zaluzhny reported to Zelensky about the possible tactical encirclement of Artemovsk (Bakhmut)."" The channel quotes internal reports: ""Russian troops have increased the onslaught on the city from all sides. They complicated the communication of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian army suffers heavy losses. The General Staff is forced to throw all new units to protect the city."" Ukrainian telegram channels are very reluctant to confirm the advance of Russian troops in the direction of Krasny Liman, Avdiivka, Maryinka. And with even greater reluctance they recognize the steady increase in losses on the Ukrainian side. Among the main reasons for the interception of the initiative of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the following can be noted. - There is a clear advantage of the Russian side in artillery systems, including MLRS, in the timely delivery of ammunition to the positions, as well as in general in manpower. - Numerous facts of demoralization in the armed formations of Ukraine on the line of combat contact were revealed. Squads, platoons, companies of Ukrainians expose the flanks of their troops, fleeing to the rear or surrendering. - Time works for Russia, and not only in matters of improving the quality of management of units and subdivisions. - The disabling of key facilities of the energy system of Ukraine has already significantly complicated the supply, power supply, navigation and communication in the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697586/,Oleksandr BOYKO,2022-12-23,"The fighter, who poured his legs into the SVO, began to make 164 jumps on the rope","In the hospital, wounded soldiers of Rosgvardia are treated with an electrostatic field and cause the hormone of joy at a temperature of minus 110 degrees Celsius","Military doctors of the Main Military Clinical Hospital of Rosgvardia showed unique methods of rehabilitation of participants in a special military operation who were injured. ""More than 98% of patients effectively recover from injury in a short time. Most of them return to their units after a rehabilitation course at the Center for Restorative Medicine of Rosgvardia. There are frequent cases when servicemen and employees who until recently were patients of the hospital return to the zone of a special military operation, ""said Viktor Guban, head of the Main Military Clinical Hospital of Rosgvardia. Colonel of the Medical Service Tatyana Afanasyeva, Head of the Center for Restorative Medicine of the Main Military Clinical Hospital of Rosgvardia, told about the treatment of Rosgvardeytsy who were injured during a special military operation, about the unique methods of restoring their health and the processes of applying advanced rehabilitation technologies. ""In the treatment and rehabilitation of military personnel, doctors of physical therapy (exercise therapy), physiotherapists, psychotherapists, chiropractors, traumatologists and others are involved. The center is equipped with three modern exercise therapy halls and a mechanotherapy hall, in which there are power multifunctional simulators for various muscle groups, cardiovascular equipment, a suspension system, verticalizers for patients with spinal injuries, simulators with active-passive rehabilitation with feedback and others, ""Afanasyeva listed. There is even a sauna where the temperature is maintained - minus 110 degrees Celsius. Even the coldest parts of Antarctica are much warmer. ""The patient is stressed, as a result, he produces a hormone of joy, the patient's mood rises,"" the doctor says. It is said that after such a sauna, patients accelerate all recovery processes in the body. The effectiveness of physical exercises depends on the observance of the correct technique of their implementation, so patients are trained exclusively under the supervision of professional instructors. The exercise therapy hall is one of the favorite places of the military paramedic Ensign Nikita D. The soldier lost his right leg during a combat mission in the zone of a special military operation. Now Nikita is undergoing the final stage of rehabilitation, preparing for prosthetics. The warrant officer gives useful advice and recommendations to other servicemen who have received similar injuries and sets them up in a positive way. Nikita's example was also inspired by the private of the military special forces Mayirbek M. from the Chechen Republic. His left leg was amputated, but the Rosgvardeets does not give up and daily sets new personal records in athletics. Another of his achievements is 164 jumping rope. Now Mayirbek is undergoing the third stage of rehabilitation - preparation for prosthetics. Among the advanced methods, Afanasyeva singled out the impact of the alternating electrostatic field of the Khivamat-200 system. An electrostatic field is generated between the massage therapist's special gloves and the patient's body. The device is very effective for improving blood and lymph circulation, relieving edema, reducing phantom pain, preparing the stump (limb remaining after amputation) for prosthetics. In the massage room, we met Senior Sergeant Alexander B., a volunteer who performed tasks as part of the Rosgvardia special forces detachment. During the execution of the combat mission, he received a fracture of the pelvis and lower limbs, being sandwiched between the APC and the Tiger. After being wounded, he could not walk. Within two months in the hospital, he was put on his feet. He is currently jogging in the fresh air in the morning. Also in the hospital use high-intensity lasers, magnetotherapy, hydromassage baths with chromotherapy, therapeutic local baths, various showers and local baths for the limbs. Among the modern methods of treatment, Tatyana Afanasyeva also highlights ergotherapy, which is aimed at rehabilitating patients who have completely or partially lost the ability to carry out self-care, move independently, navigate, communicate, control their behavior, learn and engage in work, fully relax. One of the patients who undergo daily ergotherapy is a soldier of Rosgvardia, Senior Sergeant Nabir G. The patient is undergoing rehabilitation after a mine-explosive wound, as a result of which he could lose both arms and both legs. Doctors at the hospital saved the patient's legs and left arm. Today, in the rehabilitation and educational center created on the basis of the branch of the A.A. Vishnevsky Military Hospital in Moscow, Lieutenant General Yuri Bobrov presented certificates of completion of the course of additional vocational education, military ranks and state awards to the servicemen participating in the special military protection operation, acting head of the Main Personnel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. Distinguished servicemen were awarded 19 state awards, including 10 orders of ""Courage"", 5 medals ""For Courage"" and 2 medals of ""Suvorov"" and 2 medals of Zhukov. Earlier, a Decree of the President of Russia was held on the awarding of these servicemen. The new specialties obtained at the educational center will allow servicemen who have been wounded to continue their service in new military positions in the organizations of the Ministry of Defense. Yuri Bobrov expressed his gratitude to the awardees for courage and bravery shown in the performance of military duty: . ""Here, in the rehabilitation and educational center, you have successfully passed the recovery period, received the necessary knowledge and skills and are ready to perform your duties. The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation has signed orders appointing you to military posts and conferring military ranks. The Central Commission of the Ministry of Defense decided to issue you with combat veteran certificates."" ""All servicemen are provided with housing (more than 30 received new housing), taking into account the location of the new duty station, transport accessibility and the availability of social infrastructure facilities. Or they will be able to receive monthly monetary compensation for renting housing in the chosen place of residence, ""said Artem Svyatnenko, head of the Department of Housing And Housing Management of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The head of the branch 2 of the AA Vishnevsky Central Veterinary Hospital, Colonel Vladimir Yudin, said that a personal rehabilitation program has been developed for each patient of the hospital.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697584/,Daria MARKOVA,2022-12-22,Children - in the hands of,"This is the name of the humanitarian action, the headquarters of which was recently opened in the Zaporozhye region","Children clutch boxes of brand new heaters with a smile, mothers hold heavy bags of food in their hands, and teenagers pack their things, preparing to go to the children's camp for an unusual shift. Such a blissful picture was ""drawn"" thanks to the organizers of the humanitarian action ""Children - in the hands"". Recently, its regional headquarters was opened in the Zaporizhzhya region. This unique project is being implemented in the DPR, LPR and now in our region with the support of the Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova. As part of the action, activists help children with everything they need. Someone asks for a teddy bear, and someone a heater, because it is very cold at home. Volunteers collect everything, add the necessary products to the parcel and transfer them to families. On their first visit, the activists of ""Children - in hand"" brought warm clothes, generators, heaters and food to the Zaporozhye region. Children and their parents themselves say what they need. If there are many children in the family, she, of course, will be given not one, but several boxes with food and gifts. Then he brought the necessary things and talked with the families of the adviser to the Office of the Commissioner for Children's Rights Alexei Petrov. - Our activity is complex, consists of several areas. First of all, this is prompt and targeted humanitarian assistance to children,"" he said. Another area in which activists work is the provision of specialized medical care. Thus, thanks to them, dozens of children in Melitopol undergo medical rehabilitation every day in the Comprehensive Social Service Center. ""Children - in hand"", by the way, will help to repair the pool in this center and purchase modern equipment. Activists also organize shifts for children in the children's camp ""Litvinovo"" near Moscow. The first 75 guys from the Zaporizhzhya region have already left there in early December. Any child can get to the camp, you just need to leave a request on the website of the action. In the camp, teenagers from the annexed regions rest, study, develop and undergo psychological rehabilitation. Experienced specialists work with them. And Olympic champions, famous actors and bloggers come to communicate, share experience and support the guys. - Such trips help our children not only to improve their health, but also to lay the foundation for their future, find new friends and recharge with good emotions. I am grateful to Maria Alekseevna for the inexhaustible mercy, care and attention to our children, - said the acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky. In the future, it is planned to open centers for working with adolescents in the cities of the region. KSTAT. Anyone can do a good deed. You can help the action ""Children - in the hands"" in social networks. Humanitarian aid (from toys to generators) has already been received by more than eight thousand children in the Zaporozhye region."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697578/,Anna SHILYAEVA,2022-12-22,In the Zaporozhye region there is a humanitarian landing force,"Young people help the elderly, orphans and large families: a list of good deeds of volunteers","""We definitely have a future with such guys,"" says 92-year-old Maria Danilova from Melitopol. At this point, the elderly woman's voice trembles. She has been living alone for many years. I used to count on myself. I knew there was no one to help. When volunteers first came to her, the pensioner was even afraid to open the door. She says she didn't believe that anyone could help her just like that, unselfishly. Activists of the ""Volunteer Company"" and the ""Young Guard of United Russia"" took the grandmother under the wing a few months ago. They helped her in the yard: they watered the weeds, and the fallen leaves were removed. Now the pensioner is not afraid that the winter will be snowy, and she herself will not have enough strength to clear the path. He knows that the ""humanitarian landing force"" will come to the rescue - this is how the residents of the Zaporozhye region call the guys. Maria Danilova volunteers also help with food packages. - Oh, guys, well, you shouldn't have, that's why you're doing this? - Modest elderly woman. The activist answered this question briefly: ""We help at the call of the heart."" As the acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevgeny Balitsky said in his telegram channel, there is an upsurge in the volunteer movement in Russia. - And Zaporizhzhya Oblast is no exception. Hundreds of volunteers work in the region. They deliver food, medicine, warm clothes and other necessary things to those in need. Our fearless volunteers regularly bring humanitarian supplies to fighters in the combat contact zone, saving many lives. Volunteers of Zaporizhzhya region are part of a large team. Together we will overcome all the difficulties,"" Balitsky said. Activists of the ""Young Guard"" and the ""Volunteer Company"" - young men and women from different cities of the country - consider it their duty to help people. Volunteers are sure that there are no small good deeds. So, according to the guys, targeted assistance has been and remains an important area of work. Young people constantly visit the elderly, large families. They necessarily bring with them what is required for these people. For example, if we are talking about the elderly, then often in the basket with products there are also medicines. And if they go to visit a mommy with small children, they grab diapers and, of course, toys. And recently, volunteers have expanded the list of wards. Recently, activists brought humanitarian kits to the department of registration and reintegration of persons without a specific place of residence in Melitopol. Those who suffered from the criminal regime of Kiev, having lost their jobs and a roof over their heads, come here for help and support. Humanitarian kits delivered by activists include personal hygiene products, canned meat, buckwheat and flour. Volunteers know that these simple things can save more than one life. - Now the wards of the center are under the patronage of volunteers. At least once a month, kits for people in difficult life situations will be delivered to the institution. After all, only by joint efforts we will be able to rescue our fellow citizens from trouble, driven into poverty by Nazi Ukraine, - commented in the ""Young Guard"". Now activists are preparing touching New Year's surprises for servicemen who are on the front line. The guys from the ""Young Guard"" and the ""Volunteer Company"" together with students from school No. 8 in Melitopol made New Year's cards for the heroes. In these works, schoolchildren put a piece of their heart. ""The children tried very hard, because they want to raise the mood and morale of our defenders on the eve of the New Year,"" the activists said. And the list of tasks for volunteers is not limited to this. For example, recently in the park near the Melitopol State University, activists opened a free reading room in the open air. At the monument to Pushkin, a book birdhouse now hangs on a tree, where anyone can borrow a book for free. In return, you can leave your own in the birdhouse. So the mini-library in Melitopol will never be empty. - Because reading today is fashionable, in Melitopol - a real book boom, - the volunteers assured. A little later, volunteers donated a street library to the residents of Primorsk. -And this is definitely not the last library in the Zaporizhzhya region,"" the volunteers said. And more recently, volunteers handed over one hundred food packages, warm clothes and children's literature to the Terpenyev boarding school. Within the walls of the boarding school, one hundred special children from all over the Zaporozhye region study. They study the school curriculum here and study with a speech therapist and a defectologist. Also in the boarding school there are classes of pedagogical correction. According to the management of the institution, such assistance for the boarding school is very important."

The beginning of the CVO was announced by President Vladimir Putin, who called the main goal of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation the protection of the civilian population of Donbass from genocide by the militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and neo-Nazi Ukrainian formations.

In the Donetsk direction, in the course of offensive actions, our soldiers eliminated a joint tactical group of foreign mercenaries. Militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck the center of Kherson controlled by Ukraine with American missiles. The Kiev authorities are trying to blame Russia for what happened, but in reality the blow to the city was inflicted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

At the resort, the family settled in the room, Anatoly draws up all the documents to receive payments for children and send them to kindergarten and school. - Many thanks to the residents of Anapa, who sheltered us and gave us a roof over our heads, we do not need anything now, but the elder needs conditions for classes, the little one does not allow her to study in one room. We, of course, need our own corner, - the man shares. The issue of housing for a father with many children was decided by the Governor of the Krasnodar Territory Veniamin Kondratyev. The head of the region just came to see in what conditions the evacuees from the Kherson region live. After learning about the situation in which the man found himself, it was decided to help the family. On the same day, Anatoly received a certificate for 6 million rubles with three children. ""My children and I grew up on the land, so I would like to buy a house with a small plot so that we can all be comfortable,"" said a single father. Now the man is sure that he and his children will be able to establish life in a new place. The daughter and sons will study and go to kindergarten, and he will go to work. With the receipt of Russian citizenship, internally displaced persons associate changes for the better in their lives: older people will receive a decent pension and benefits, young people will be able to officially get a job and get a housing certificate for the purchase of an apartment or house."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4697543/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-23,Kiev is confident that the conflict in Ukraine will soon end. But Russia has a different opinion on this matter.,Military historian Yuri Knutov said that Washington intends to prolong the conflict in order to delay the special operation.,"The Russian military will adapt to Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems, as they successfully resist the already supplied NATO weapons now. However, such abandonments lead to a significant prolongation of the conflict. This opinion was expressed by military historian and expert Yuri Knutov in the morning broadcast on the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"". - Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Danilov called the next two or three months of the conflict decisive. What do you say? Or is it for years? Ivan Pankin, one of the hosts of the morning show ""What Will Happen"", asked. ""The conflict will not end within two or three months,"" Yuri Knutov said. ""It will last maybe two or three years. Moreover, this duration is determined not so much by us: if it were not for the help of NATO, we would have already completed the special operation victoriously three months ago. By that time, we had destroyed the main types of weapons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from 80 to 95% of tanks, armored cars, aircraft, anti-aircraft missile systems, MLRS and long-range artillery. The Kiev regime simply would have nothing to fight. Then came the Soviet-style equipment from the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, which are now in NATO. We also demilitarized it, and now basically purely NATO weapons are already underway. Under these conditions, it is useless to talk about the fact that we will now begin to conduct an offensive, as during the Great Patriotic War, to cut, surround, smash. Squeezing tactics are used quite successfully. I think that it will continue to be used successfully. By the way, we should not forget that the demilitarization of the NATO bloc is going more or less well in our country. At the latest meeting on arms sales to the Kiev regime, 20 countries from 30 countries said their military arsenals had dried up. And of the remaining 10, only the United States is ready to supply weapons in approximately the same volumes in which it supplies now. If it were not for the US policy, we could say that in two or three months the special operation would end with our victory and the surrender of the Kiev regime. Unfortunately, Washington is not interested in this. The U.S. military-industrial complex only smelled the money. For a long time, Afghanistan allowed them to receive quite serious incomes, and the operation in Ukraine increased the size of such revenues from the sale of weapons tenfold compared to Afghanistan. A waterfall of money fell on them, why should they give it up? No way! They will pay their lobbyists huge fees, they will put pressure on other states to keep this war going. And they don't care that people are dying. There will be a prolongation of the conflict through the fault of Washington, first of all. - Then why does the head of the NSDC Danilov make such statements. - Thus, they are trying to cheer up their armed forces and the population, give a breath of optimism. It's too much depression there now. They say: we will seize Melitopol in two or three months and reach Crimea. In the summer, Zelensky is already going to rest by the sea, meaning that the Crimea will be Ukrainian. - Vladimir Putin said that Russia does not intend to repeat the mistakes of the past, when for the sake of increasing the defense capability it destroyed the country's economy. ""We will not engage in the militarization of the country and the economy."" What mistakes are we talking about. - This refers to the Soviet period, when the production of consumer goods was on the outskirts. Televisions, radios were produced mainly from rejected parts. Transistors were produced for defense needs, the batch was checked, some number turned out to be faulty, this whole batch is sent to the production of televisions. And then they break down six months later. All this caused serious discontent. The money went to armaments, the maintenance of the army. In the 80s, we found ourselves in such a position that the stores were empty, clothes of unclear size and shape. And all this formed a serious discontent, which, among other things, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. - We laughed when HIMARS was handed over to Ukraine. But HIMARS proved to be very capable. Now the Americans are transferring the Patriot air defense system to Ukraine. - In the beginning there were Javelins, we were very afraid of them. And then it turned out that they came up with an interesting thing, cheap, primitive and simple, but very effective, which protects armored vehicles from them. It's the same story with HIMARS. They beat accurately, effectively. Time passed, the technology of how to shoot them down was worked out: algorithms appeared, flight telemetry was recorded, and software was developed. Put other air defense systems, shoot down to 80%. The same story will be with Patriot: at first they will work effectively, we will study them, look at the frequencies, characteristics ... They have a lot of vulnerabilities. The sector is not 360 degrees, but 90 degrees. Big problem with mobility. 25 minutes the complex turns and collapses. Our complexes do it in 5 minutes. In modern combat, 25 minutes is an extremely long time. During this time, the complex can be detected and destroyed. We have anti-radar missiles, which we will also refine for Patriot frequencies. One Patriot is worth $1 billion. A single Patriot missile costs between 3 and 4 million. Range from 80 to 200 kilometers. The European version of the missiles in the same Germany is a range of 160 kilometers. The complexes deployed on the territory of Poland, along the border with Ukraine, will create a de facto no-fly zone over the territory of Western Ukraine. That's the danger. There you can place bases, headquarters, warehouses, training centers, command posts in Western Ukraine. And all this will be covered by patriots, which are on Polish territory, which we cannot shoot at. What patriots will give to Ukraine is to see how these systems behave in real combat conditions. They will be effective against cruise missiles. But against drones, I doubt it. It's like shooting gold bullets at sparrows. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698590/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-26,Coup d'état and overthrow of Zelensky: the truth about the change of power in Ukraine is revealed,Columnist Grishin assessed the chances in the struggle between Zelensky and Zaluzhny for power in Ukraine,"In the Russian ""expert"" environment, discussions about the struggle for power in today's Ukraine do not cease. With a periodicity of once a week, at least, on TV screens or on the air of YouTube channels, another expert appears who says that either the Americans are about to change Zelensky to Zaluzhny, or that Zelensky will remove the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny from day to day to eliminate the threat to himself as president. In reality, these conversations are most like a transfusion from empty to empty. There are no prerequisites for either the first or the second now. No matter how we feel about Zelensky, and he fully deserved all the nicknames that are given to him, and there is really nowhere to put stigmas on him, he and his team built such a rigid vertical of power that does not exist anywhere else in the world now – neither among the ""democracies, nor among the so-called dictatorial regimes. Any political opposition has been completely destroyed in the country. Some parties are banned even formally, and the rest compete in expressing loyalty to the existing regime. All media outlets that could criticize one or another step of the head of state and his team have been eliminated. Literature that goes beyond ideological blinders is prohibited. The constant ideological pumping of the population has led to the fact that people do not perceive an opinion different from the ""correct"", even from their friends and relatives. The practice of denunciations to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and counterintelligence agencies is extremely widespread and is expanding every day. In order to become unreliable, it is enough, for example, to read a book in Russian language or speak Russian. Severe discipline in terms of punishment for dissent and desertion has been introduced in the army. It comes to the death penalty for those who allow themselves ""separatist sentiments"" or talk about saving a life by surrendering. At the same time, the heads of law enforcement agencies in the field of intelligence and counterintelligence, internal affairs bodies are promoted to their posts and appointed personally by Zelensky, which means that personal loyalty should not be discounted. Under these conditions, either a ""frostbitten"" desperate brave man can decide to rebel against Zelensky, or a completely stupid inadequate. Zaluzhny does not belong to such characters, and may find himself in office not as a result of a coup, but solely on the initiative of Zelensky himself. Which is clearly not set up for that. Zelensky is not just satisfied with his current position, he is bathed in his own popularity, revels in importance, tastes the fruits of his involvement in the world elite and is clearly ready to perform an encore. The Americans and the British may be pleased or dissatisfied with Zelensky, but he is no longer just a puppet in their ""clever and strained hands"" and retains a certain degree of freedom of action. Moreover, he is trying to manipulate them to some extent. And this, first of all, causes their discontent and the periodically arising desire to change him to a more obedient character. But Zaluzhny is unlikely to become exactly what they need, and changing the awl for soap is more expensive for themselves. As for the removal of Zaluzhny, now zelensky is quite satisfied with him. How he is satisfied with the fact that at any time he can change his commander-in-chief to another general. Which he will certainly do, but only when something threatens Zelensky himself as head of state. And it's unlikely to be just a defeat on the battlefield. The reason for such a decision may be either a large-scale military catastrophe, for which at the moment there are no reasons. Or elections if Zaluzhny joins the Zelensky-regulated moderate opposition, which as a result of such an alliance may try to become uncontrollable by the Office of the President of Ukraine in order to deprive Zaluzhny of a significant part of his political weight. But these are also not matters of the near days. And in the near future, the already existing contradictions will remain between Zelensky and Zaluzhny, it would be foolish to deny them, but they will not affect their interaction and the situation in Ukraine and will not become insurmountable. So, you can build various intricate designs, puff up your cheeks and mumble something indistinct in the manner of Baba Vanga, the political situation in Ukraine will not change from this. A coup d'état in Ukraine in the near future is hardly possible, as well as a mild change of power. And to bet on this that Ukraine will be weakened and fragmented from within is the height of stupidity. LISTEN AS WELL.

""This was also the case this time, when the hyacinths worked out the hangars, where Ukrainian nationalists organized a point for the repair and maintenance of armored vehicles, the fire of which was corrected by the soldiers of our unit,"" Rosgvardia explained. Two shots, corrections and a dozen shells go exactly to the target. Later, after a detailed analysis of the video received from the copter, it becomes clear that both the special forces of Rosgvardia and the artillerymen of the Ministry of Defense did an excellent job. The result is dozens of liquidated Nazis and several units of destroyed armored vehicles. ""In the zone of the special military operation, various means of aerial reconnaissance are actively used. In the special purpose units of Rosgvardia, unmanned aerial vehicles of the quadrocopter type are widely used.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698301/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-25,"Russia is preparing for the battle ""Armata"": What will change in the zone of the SVO tank, which has no equal","Military observer Viktor Baranets called the Armata a ""tank-manager"", which has no equal","Russian specialists are improving military equipment and continue to create new weapons that have no analogues in the world. One of these vehicles is the T-14 Armata tank, which is now undergoing combat coordination at Russian training grounds. Journalist and TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov on December 25 showed a video of the combat coordination of a tank battalion equipped with armata. The TV presenter said that he would not name the exact place where the military are trained, but noted a significant number of combat vehicles that work at the training ground not only alone, but also together. - I will not say what exactly the Armata has of weapons, but this will be an extremely unpleasant surprise for any troops who try to stand in our way. And what is important, we are not talking about a single copy, but about a significant number [of tanks] that will determine the nature of the battle in certain areas,"" Solovyov said on the TV channel Russia 24. Especially for the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"", the military observer of the KP.RU Viktor Baranets revealed the features of the unique tank and told about its main ""chips"". According to the expert, ""Armata"" is a ""tank-manager"", which has no equal. - I had the honor to be the first Russian military journalist who was allowed by the Minister of Defense to visit this tank. I wrote about it in KP. I was a tank driver in my first life as a soldier. When I climbed into the Armata, the first impression was something like if I had moved from a rural tractor, one with such levers everywhere, into the cab of a modern superliner. I didn't see any wheels, no levers, no brakes, no throttle. The instructor who was with me says: you are behind in life, you work with a joystick, - said Viktor Nikolaevich. Now the T-14, according to Solovyov, is on combat coordination. What's next. - This tank has been tested for a long time. And I think he's slowly going to be pulled up to the battlefield. Our testers are now ""killing"" it at Russian training grounds in various modes - in cold, hot, in mud, in sand and so on, - said Colonel Baranets. - The first difference between this tank and all classic tanks is that the crew is separate from the shells. If an enemy shell hits an ordinary tank, it explodes, the crew explodes. Here, the crew is separated by powerful armor from shells. Shells are supplied automatically. The soldier pressed the button, the commander took aim, and fired. It all works. The tank has a mighty engine. And it can be 1300 ""horses"", and maybe 1500. He has an interesting 125-millimeter gun, which, while the tank is being tested, can develop into a 152-millimeter. From the same gun you can shoot a guided missile. This tank has very powerful protection. First, dynamic protection. The hull of the tank is lined with special plates. When the American Javelin flies up to our Armata, then perhaps even this plate will fly towards it at the very last moment. Or this plate will explode along with the warhead of the Javelin. And the crew will not be harmed. Maybe it will only shake well there,"" says the military observer. - Another feature of armata is the Afghanit system. When the supostat shoots at the T-14 tank, the Afghanit system instantly detects the shell that flies into the tank. And she sends her projectile towards him, which either blows him up or knocks him off the trajectory. But that's not all. Any tank has the weakest point – the turret. Both Javelins and aircraft missiles are trying to aim there. And then our golden heads from the defense industry were provided. They put here not only an automatic anti-aircraft machine gun, but also a system that will be able to reflect the shells that fly into the turret of the tank. I don't know of any other tank in the world like the Armata that is so stuffed with electronics. When I talked to the designers, they made a tank. Someone trucked, someone engined, someone cannon, someone boiled steel. They themselves were amazed that the result was an intelligent tank. This tank will appear on the battlefield not just as a combat unit. It will be a network-centric tank. Because it will observe the situation on the battlefield and transmit to the T-90 or T-72 tanks both the position on the battlefield and the targets that these tanks must destroy in the first place. The Armata will also shoot. We get the T-14 not just as combat hardware, which has the peculiarities of tactical and technical characteristics, but also a tank-manager,"" Baranets summed up in an interview with journalists of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"".

Oleg Nikolaevich, judging by the fact that your phone was turned off for several days, there was no connection ... And then you called me back from a southern city, let's say– you had a very interesting business trip, and you were in uniform. I guessed it right. -Think so. Be sure to visit our guys before the New Year. - Tell me how your guys are. - They feel very confident, they are already on the ground, they are building up combat coordination, reinforcements are arriving, including another Tiger detachment that has entered combat positions. They receive the necessary equipment, uniforms, replenish with ammunition. So they are strengthened, and with moral, psychological qualities the order is complete, self-confident. And, of course, for them congratulations from their native Primorye residents in those parts that are here (and we tried to visit our legendary 155th, 5th, 83rd), all this is of great importance. They handed over gifts and equipment. That is, this bridge, which constantly exists in our country and makes it possible for children to receive help from home ... And - to realize that they are remembered, known, appreciated, they are rightfully proud of them. - We will not disclose the location where exactly you were all this time. - Of course not. - Then tell me... When your guys see that Oleg Kozhemyako appears in a military uniform, in a helmet, and sometimes some weapons in your hands, their reaction is what is the first one. - Well, I'm only wearing a helmet when I'm directly in the line of fire, where any... Well, when you need to take security measures. And so a normal reaction. Because this is not the first time we have been there, as far as I understand, the sixth time, so, in principle, there is already, for example, such an understanding that this is just part of our work. This is true, because a lot of Primorye residents today are in the SVO zone, and these are our boys, our guys, both young and adult, who understand that they are doing the right work, they are clearing the land of Nazis. Therefore, the appearance of the governor there (and with me and other guys) is of great importance from the point of view of understanding that the Primorsky Territory will always support them both in my person and in the person of my fellow countrymen, who very much transfer humanitarian aid for those who are now in the SVO zone. It is not limited - it is equipment, somewhere and cars, it is just gifts, it is letters from children, and warm things. Therefore, probably, a good half of the region lives by this. Because for many people it is connected with husbands, with fathers, with acquaintances, relatives, with close people. And here you can not break away in any way, you need to constantly be aware of the events taking place there, and, of course, to help as much as possible. And the government of Primorsky Krai is doing everything possible to ensure that our guys are provided with everything they need, which the government can provide, say, and what we can get. Except, of course, military equipment. This is taken care of by the Ministry of Defense. - I understand that you do not read the letters, but still you know that there, in these messages - wives, children, friends. - You know, we do not read them, but involuntarily you pay attention to this, because they are in the most, as they say, cherished places pasted, where the guys live. That is, it reminds them of home every time – a letter from a child, a letter from a daughter, a son, drawings. - Oleg Nikolaevich, taking this opportunity. We have 400 broadcasting cities, including Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda in Primorye and Vladivostok. You are a popular politician of the federal scale, and you have the right to some congratulations and wishes to the Russians... Please pass it on. - First of all, of course, I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year. This year was filled with many events that took place in our country for the first time, including. This is a special military operation, this is the entry of new subjects into the Russian Federation. These are certainly some moments related to the memory of those guys who gave their lives in the fight against Nazism. This should also not be forgotten. Therefore, the year was difficult, the year was very important for the country. But at the same time, the economy withstood, the army showed results that, despite all the attempts of NATO countries to reverse the situation, they do not succeed. The economy has endured, our people have endured, and our people have become even more entrenched in unity and patriotism. Now we understand more clearly what needs to be done in the economy. The Ministry of Defense understands even more the tasks that they face in order to achieve Victory in their subsequent actions. Therefore, we will all work together to solve the tasks that the state and our people are facing today. And, of course, I want to wish everyone health, success, all the best, well-being. Well, so that those who today have loved ones at the front, waiting for their return home with victory. - Thank you very much. Thank you for calling back. Congratulations to you! Good luck, health, all the best in the New Year. -Best regards. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"

And then they were herded to Azovstal. And there these ""heroes"" shamefully surrendered. The ""excellent"" story of the revived military unit. - Of the ""merits"" of them, which ones can be cited. - They nightmarished civilians for eight years, then sat near Mariupol.

I think Azov is being revived precisely under Western mercenaries. - Why under them. - This is a recognizable military brand in the West. They want to bring in a new flow of volunteers. Probably, there are still idiots in the West. Azov has always positioned itself as a neo-Nazi international organization where people fight for ""white ideas."" And there will be a second edition. What are they counting on? Perhaps they have the only military brand left that will help Ukraine in propaganda, in its difficult struggle for the interests of the West. - Zelensky's visit to America coincided with information about the return of Azov - this is related. - If they want to continue to bring mercenaries from the West, instructors to Ukraine, then Azov is a legal roof for foreigners.

Thanks to a well-built defense and thanks to the engineering equipment of the positions, the rapid offensive of the militants was disrupted. Having entered into battle with the superior forces of the enemy, the unit of Alexander Perelygin destroyed two tanks, BMP and more than 20 nationalists, while Corporal Alexander Perelygin himself, competently choosing a position in the defense, destroyed a tank and five Ukrainian militants with fire from an RPG and small arms. The courage and selfless actions of Alexander Perelygin made it possible to prevent the breakthrough of Ukrainian nationalists in this direction."" FOILED A PANZER ATTACK BY THE ARMED FORCES. Guards Lieutenant Polina FOTEV. ""The chief of communications is the platoon commander of the control of the anti-tank division. Guards Lieutenant Polina Foteva ensured uninterrupted, stable communications within the anti-tank division, as well as the exchange of information between the division and the higher command. Being in a forward position with her division, Polina found a platoon of enemy tanks attempting to outflank our units. Quickly assessing the situation, Polina reported to the division commander about the detected armored unit of Ukrainian nationalists and transmitted the exact coordinates of its location. After our units entered the battle, Polina corrected the fire of Russian artillery and recorded the destruction of enemy armored vehicles. The enemy, having suffered heavy losses, retreated. Thanks to the professional and timely actions of the Guards Lieutenant Polina Foteva, it was possible to disrupt the offensive of Ukrainian nationalists on the positions of Russian troops, to detect and quickly destroy two enemy tanks and three armored vehicles in a timely manner.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698102/,Alexander KOTS,2022-12-25,"""Every house, every street is gnawed out"" - Why it's hard to get through to the front line, and cities are not taken in a hurry","Military anchor ""KP"" Alexander Kots in the Youtube stream ""Komsomolka"" answered the questions of readers of our newspaper - why the United States will not so easily abandon the conflict in Ukraine and how to deliver a parcel to a native fighter in the special operation zone","- First of all, we congratulate you on your inclusion in the Human Rights Council under the President of Russia. What are your activities in this Council? - This is actually an advisory body that develops proposals for the president on the development of civil society and on the protection of human rights. This organization does not work with citizens' appeals. There is the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights Moskalkova, where citizens' appeals are dealt with. But there are many representatives of human rights organizations (and not only) in the HRC who work with these appeals. For example, Tatyana Georgievna Merzlyakova, the ombudsman of the Sverdlovsk region, who several times went to the special operation zone, actually communicated with the fighters on the ""front"". I am on the Council as a representative of the military. But there is no organization behind me, so I deal with citizens' appeals personally, as far as I have enough time and energy. - Something can be solved. - We didn't have Field Mail. Now it has appeared, but there have been complaints about its work, some parcels are returned, they do not reach the addressee. Not always some things happen through the fault of the Ministry of Defense. I was dealing with the case of a woman whose two parcels did not arrive. There are still shortcomings in the work of the Russian Post. Because this is the first time they have encountered this. Now much at the post office is automated - I put a tick in the wrong place - and that's it, the parcel is returned. Now they are really working on these problems. The connection of relatives with fighters is very important. The family of a career soldier understands perfectly well that if a husband, father or son does not get in touch for a month, this is normal, this happens to a person serving. And when people are civilians, a month ago their son worked in a factory, and now he is a soldier, and he does not get in touch for two weeks, people are already worried. In the zone of the special operation, there are places where the connection does not catch or where it is forbidden to go on the air, because immediately the enemy will strike at the cellular signal. Therefore, I would urge relatives not to try to make your son or husband constantly call you. Sometimes a call from the front line is a danger. - We have the following question: ""Who can I ask for help with thermal imagers? My husband was mobilized, he wrote to our governor, who said that it was a big expense.... - We need to look for volunteers in our regions. Or turn to the already proven. There is no single center to which you would call, and you were immediately sent the necessary. And, unfortunately, there is a saying: ""To whom the war, to whom the mother is dear."" There are cases when a humanitarian, which is sent at the request of a fighter, is suddenly sold somewhere on the black market. Therefore, if I, for example, work with someone, it is only at the request of the commanders of a particular regiment or brigade. Here comes the gunner to the chief of artillery of the regiment: ""I need 3 copters, 2 thermal imagers."" He calls me. These are the ones I work with all the time, I can't supply everyone. There are units with which we have developed good relations, I help them. It's also a job to find a supply chain. There is no such thing that here it is, the free market, choose a volunteer who will work for you. But initiative commanders build all this on their own. And where the commander does not want to do this, there is a little worse with supplies. - There was a popular prediction that the fighting would slow down with the arrival of winter. Winter has come, but our Artemovsk is successfully pushing. There are battles for Soledar, Avdiivka. - The Great Patriotic War was not interrupted for the winter. And the capture of the Donetsk airport in 2015 or the battles for Debaltseve also went on in the winter. It is clear that now the activity of heavy equipment has decreased. Because rasputitsa turned the fields into an impassable mulyaka, and to drive tanks on the asphalt is to bury the roads. At the same time, we see that on the Svatovsky frontier the enemy attacks literally daily. But the attacks there are fighting back. By the way, already our mobilized. We see a ""meat grinder"" around Artemovsk, there is a step-by-step offensive in the area of Ugledar, the movement to Avdiivka, heavy, stubborn, because every house and street is gnawed out. The enemy resists very strongly. That is, there are positional battles, but with little of our progress. The volume of work of the Russian artillery has increased by an order of magnitude. Moreover, the accuracy has also increased. - Due to what. - We have come to the conclusion that we form the very same reconnaissance and strike circuit, when the target from the scouts on the front line is directly transmitted to the gun, and it opens fire within 2 minutes, we can consider - instantly. And in such a scheme, the mobilized are already successfully working. I ask their commanders, ""And how do they shoot at all?"" To which he seriously told me: ""Jewel!. - We have people who did not fully understand what happened to Kherson. Andrei Gribanovsky asks: ""Why do you constantly talk about the successes of the Russian army, and then this army leaves Kherson?"". - I cannot be responsible for everyone, I am responsible only for myself and for my reports. I'm not writing that we're doing well, that there are no problems. I always talk about them. Maybe not as harshly as someone would like, because after all, this is my army. And it depends on me, among other things, to solve the problems in it. I am involved in this, unlike those who are on the couches of our native Armed Forces. There is no simple answer to Kherson. It was impossible to fully protect the supply lines there. Therefore, unfortunately, we had to leave the city so that our group could take up the defense along the already prepared lines. Yes, this was a difficult legacy that General Surovikin inherited from previous commanders. It is clear that when we started the special operation, we counted on something else. But it turned out that the Ukrainian army was being prepared for this conflict. It turned out that the population was brainwashed by Russophobia, and no one met us with pies and flowers. For some, it was a discovery. Unfortunately, many still lived with the ideas of 2014 about the Ukrainian army. But that doesn't mean we lost. Here you can delve into the reasons for a long time, but the people who are fighting do not have time for this, they do their job. - Zelensky said that there would be no negotiations until Russia retreated to the 1991 borders. Where do all these statements come from. - It is very difficult to suspect Zelensky of independence. If his handlers want to force negotiations with Russia, he will be the first to run and say, let's talk. It's a man like a pregnant woman - a very fickle mood in him. - However, he does not agree with our terms. - We call on Kiev to withdraw troops from the Donbass - well, it is clear that they will not do this there. There's still the strength to resist. And Zelensky does not even worry about losses. - Why weapons are still quietly supplied to Ukraine from the West. - Maybe because we don't have enough intelligence? There are logical questions – why haven't we broken all the railway bridges and tunnels yet? First, they are very difficult to break. They were built under the Soviet Union, in the hope of withstanding air strikes. The experience of the same Antonovsky Bridge near Kherson shows this. To make it clear - on the last night, Russian light equipment came out on it. Although on this bridge there were 142 hits by American ""Hymars"". Just put thick iron sheets on top of the funnels. And they passed. And what can we say about railway bridges! It takes a lot of precision-guided weapons to bring them down. But let's see how the attacks on the enemy's critical infrastructure will be conducted further, because this also has a great effect. Let it not be lightning fast, let it be cumulative. - Here the question is raised that Ukrainian cities remain without electricity and water. - I have a dispute with the citizens of Ukraine in absentia about this. Listen, if you are left without light or water, then in Donetsk without water for several months. Kiev has been killing the infrastructure of Donbass for eight years, but everyone has been silent and silent. Here I see, but here I don't see. Is that the case? And the problems of electricity at social facilities are solved very simply - with diesel generators. You will ask your authorities why generators are not installed in your hospitals. Why is it more important for your authorities to spend money on the shells with which they hit the peaceful quarters of Donetsk?! That's what you're going to ask. - Obviously, the main beneficiaries of the conflict in Ukraine are not even the West as a whole, but the United States. What needs to happen for them to say – that's it, enough is enough, let's stop. - Yeah, they won't stop anything. I assure you, they do not have a goal for Ukraine to defeat Russia. They have one goal - to destroy Russia. To exhaust economically, to swing from the inside – this is the task of the Americans. Many may say that this is a cliché, propaganda. But no! It's a reality. And therefore, it seems to me that the main beneficiaries can be Russian industry, the defense industry, science, which now, as in the Great Patriotic War, should grow by leaps and bounds and supply to the forefront what could turn the conflict. We simply have no other choice now. When the United States is so close to its cherished goal of destroying Russia, it will not simply abandon this goal. READ ALSO.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698317/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-26,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 26, 2022: the Armed Forces of Ukraine are feverish near Svatovo, the British are expelling refugees from their homes","We have collected the latest news about what is happening around Ukraine on December 26, 2022","Kiev revives the nationalist regiment ""Azov""* (banned in Russia), defeated in the spring battles in Mariupol. Two battalions have been formed, the third is being manned. Those who were at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, besieged by the Allied forces, and then returned to the independent one for the exchange of prisoners of war, have already joined the formation. Now to join the ranks of the unit is actively agitated on the central TV channels of the independent. Today, the Armed Forces of Ukraine include units called ""Azov"", but they are formed from volunteers and relate to territorial defense. It is worth recalling that at the end of May, 2439 Azov soldiers and servicemen of the Ukrainian army surrendered at the Azovstal iron and steel works in Mariupol. Three leaders of the nationalist unit were also captured. And after all, they are not taught anything either by defeat or humiliation. The DPA news agency reported that the majority of German residents do not support the supply of German Leopard 2 battle tanks to the independent country. The agency refers to a survey by the sociological institute YouGov. Almost half of the respondents spoke out against the supply of ""Leopards"" and less than a third answered ""for"". The provision of tanks to the Ukrainian capital is welcomed, mainly by supporters of the Greens. And most of the voters of other parties of Germany do not support supplies to Kiev. The survey was conducted from December 16 to 21. And 2,075 German citizens participated. Nothing, you didn't have any more cold, and in frosts the sharpness of perception increases... A military medic of the Western Military District said that in three months in the SVO zone, he provided assistance to more than two and a half hundred servicemen. And among them there were not only our fighters. A medic with the call sign Kasper told RIA Novosti that once a fighter in a NATO uniform was brought to him. He answered questions in Russian language, said that he was from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian doctors saved his life. And Kasper himself was wounded while assisting a seriously wounded soldier in Kuzemovka. Whether the people in white coats on the other side act as nobly, remembering the Hippocratic Oath, is a rhetorical question. The Daily Mail reports that britons who have ventured to take in refugees from Ukraine would now like to ""return"" their homes, including because of economic difficulties. Kate Daniels of the Family Therapy Association said many of those who hosted these displaced people in their homes are desperate about what will happen on Christmas and New Year's Day. Daniels says, ""They want their homes back, and rightly so."" She gave an example when the lady of the house went down to the kitchen and felt like a stranger, because everyone was talking on the phones and behaving like a master. Adis Sehić, a specialist at the Labour Rights Charity Centre, says: ""Everyone is alarmed by the rising cost of living. So it's silly to be angry because people don't want to host other families when they can barely support their own."" There is no need to be angry - but it is also not very reasonable to accept anyone with open arms. Andriy Marochko, an officer of the People's Militia of the LPR, said that the Ukrainian command is transferring additional forces to the matchmaking direction in the Donbass. Marochko explained this by the large losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the ineffectiveness of fire weapons. Earlier it was reported that the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine intends to cut the communication between the cities of Svatovo and Starobilsk in the LPR, for which it does not take into account losses even in elite units. It is characteristic that reports began to come from the central regions of Ukraine that the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to be taken directly from clubs, bars and restaurants. And with Bankova, they didn't try. The sixth president of Ukraine in his congratulation of citizens on Christmas said that ""we are not waiting for a miracle, but we create it ourselves."" Readers of the German edition of Die Welt were amazed at such self-confidence. One commenter was amazed: ""Wow, now Zelensky thinks that he can work miracles?! Isn't that crazy?"" Another believes: ""But he himself realizes that only a miracle will bring them victory. It is a pity that thousands of Ukrainians will die before this happens."" A third added, ""People who consider themselves miracle workers are overflowing with mental asylums in any country in the world."" But in some places there are still free places for new customers. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Sino-Russian relations are strong as a monolith. And they do not change under the influence of unstable international conjuncture. Wang Yi stressed, ""These relations are not subject to interference and provocation."" According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, cooperation between Beijing and Moscow is not antagonistic and is not aimed at any third party. He said: ""China and Russia firmly oppose hegemony and the new Cold War."" Yes, we have to repeat this for those who do not understand the Chinese language well, as well as the language of the mind. Felipe VI, King of Spain, said in a Christmas address to the nation that the conflict in the independent had provoked an energy crisis in his country with the most serious consequences for industry, trade and transport. The words of the monarch are reported by the publication El Pais: ""The conflict in Ukraine had a profound impact on the economy. This was reflected in higher prices for food, heating, electricity or gasoline. There are families who cannot cope with this situation for a long time and need the constant support of the authorities to mitigate its economic and social consequences."" Felipe VI urged not to ignore the ""great concern and uncertainty"" that this situation generates. And this is quite simple to do: stop sending weapons to Kiev and block such decisions at the EU level – and your difficulties will end. Could be. On the website of the National Commission for State Regulation in the Field of Energy and Utilities of ukraine, information appeared: in Ukraine, at least twice in 2023, they plan to raise tariffs for cold water and wastewater disposal services. The first increase is planned from January 1, and the second - from July 1. In the list of regions where the tariff will be increased, only Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions are absent, as well as the part of the Kherson region controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. The new tariffs are due to be approved on December 27. Well, a great New Year's gift was made to the population by those who are going to soon ""return to the borders of 1991."" You would deal with the water first, returnees.... *A terrorist organization banned in Russia. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"

The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on December 26, 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's readiness to destroy Patriot air defense systems in Ukraine. In the Zaporozhye region, the construction of a layered line of defensive structures is being completed. This was announced by a member of the main council of the regional administration, chairman of the movement ""We are together with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov. LPR people's militia officer Marochko said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were transferring reinforcements to Svatovo because of the high losses. Another reason is the ineffectiveness of Ukrainian fire weapons. Russian troops destroyed more than 80 military Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donetsk direction. Two tanks, five armoured fighting vehicles and four vehicles were hit. Russian troops killed more than 30 Ukrainian fighters in the Kupyansk direction. Russian forces also eliminated three armored fighting vehicles and three vehicles. Lieutenant Colonel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complained about the mass desertion of the military. In Ukraine, they call for tougher punishment for desertion. Russian troops struck the point of deployment of foreign mercenaries near Artemovsk. In particular, 58 artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were hit during the day. Ukrainian media reported on new cases of distribution of subpoenas on the streets.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698010/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-24,Ukraine in darkness: Kiev authorities deceive the people that there is very little left to endure,"The head of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexei Danilov, promised that Ukrainians still have to survive ""2-3, maybe four missile attacks"", and then Putin's missiles will run out","Former veterinarian, now secretary of the NSDC Oleksiy Danilov envied the laurels of a full-time Ukrainian propagandist and liar with the call sign ""Abdristovich"" and began to console Ukrainians in his own way. A few days ago, he suddenly briefly betrayed his wet fantasies about how he would destroy the Moskals together with the Ukrainians and announced in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda that Russia had literally ""two or three attacks, maybe four shelling will be scraped."" And then that's it – Putin's missiles will run out. In general, it remains quite a bit to be patient - and meet the change. Which is actually on the doorstep. By the way, just a month ago, the same former Ukrainian bandit of the middle rank with a completely untrusted chaser ""Myachik"" (because of Danilov's patronymic Myacheslavovich) already said the same words in an interview with Radio Liberty. And the number of attacks that he withdrew to Russia did not exceed the same ""two or three, maybe four"". True, no one will google in Ukraine. Therefore, Arestovich with his constant promises of help after 2-3 weeks remains popular in Nezalezhnaya, and therefore it does not matter who in a couple of weeks will sing to the Ukrainians once again ""a song about five minutes"", pardon, about 2-3 attacks, they still suck it. And from Danilov, and from Arestovich. But Danilov is, of course, a separate song. It's not a voice from the speaker. A person occupies the most important, strategic post in the structure of the Ukrainian government and carries such nonsense. Ball, what 2-3 shots, what a mess? Nothing works in your country. In your country, experts have announced that the mode of operation of the energy sector without turning off the lights can be achieved in 2 years, if there are no more missile attacks. Today, another power plant was turned off due to damage received earlier, transformers are burning in all cities due to power surges, the network is knocked out, and just yesterday the forecast was officially announced that according to the results of the 4th quarter, real production in Ukraine will decrease by more than 70%. The prime minister of the state announced that in Ukraine almost all hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants and a huge share of power grids have been damaged, and Myachik jumps and almost asks for supplements, saying that Putin does not have enough missiles, and they will soon run out. You, Myachik, do not have so many substations left that they are enough even for a couple of full-fledged Russian missile strikes. It would be better to look at the night photos of Kiev, published by the British Sky News, and compared the views of Kiev at night in January and November. At the beginning of next year, at this rate, Kiev will turn into a ""black square"" of Malevich in the darkness of the night. And then Danilov will face a really serious problem - how to convey his lies to Ukrainians if there is no light, no Internet, and, accordingly, no radio, no telethon. After all, without this dumbing down ""kiev-style truth"", they can begin to think for themselves. And the Ball will remain a ball without any prospect of evolving into a person. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698099/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-25,"The latest news about the situation on and around Ukraine on December 25, 2022: in Odessa, they refused to rename the streets, and Zelensky's associates ask for missile strikes on Iran","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 25, 2022","The mayor of Kiev Vitali ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko told the townspeople that the work of all ground electric transport was stopped in the capital of Ukraine. ""Due to the shortage of electricity, we decided to stop the work of ground electric transport in the capital,"" he wrote in Telegram and clarified that we are talking about trams and trolleybuses. Now only buses and fixed-route taxis will travel on all routes of ground electric transport, most of which are controlled by the companies of Vitali Klitschko himself and members of his team. A variant of Ukrainian invention, when a tram was dragged along the rails by a tractor, apparently turned out to be ineffective. It remains to wait for the regular horse-drawn freight and passenger transport to go along Khreshchatyk, for example, the horse-drawn tram, widely used in the 19th century, and scrap cabs on trotters. According to Alexander Babich, a member of the historical and toponymic commission of the Odessa City Council, the idea of renaming streets in honor of the Ukrainian military and individual military units who died in battles with the Russian army was abandoned in Odessa. "" We understand that the number of deaths will continue to grow and each of them deserves its own part of our memory. If now we start naming streets after them, then next year dozens, maybe hundreds of such names may appear in the city. Because we will not be able to refuse any mother, not a single brother-in-law, if they write us an appropriate appeal,"" Babich said. Instead, in Odessa, they plan to create one large monument with the names of each dead soldier, volunteer, medic, rescuer, policeman, guardsman and the names of all units that defended the south of Ukraine. Very practical approach. Given the pace of burial of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all the ""heroes-suckers of Ukraine"" streets are not only in Odessa or Kiev. And you can't graze all over the country. The Wall Street Journal pessimistically assessed the prospects of Europe to increase the production of ammunition after that. how their significant reserves were supplied to Ukraine. The WSJ, citing its sources in government circles and the defense industry, reported that the process faces serious difficulties. In particular, it is hampered by the lack of production capacity, legislative restrictions, a lack of specialized workers, bottlenecks in supply chains, high financing costs for this industry and even environmental regulations. Even if hostilities cease overnight, some ammunition manufacturers estimate that it will take Europe up to 15 years to replenish its stockpiles at current production rates. Another proof that money can compensate a lot, but is powerless against time. In Latvia, migrants from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were accommodated in the Mucenieki refugee centre. The latter are extremely dissatisfied with living conditions and even write complaints that they live in improper conditions, among mold, mucus and other unsanitary conditions. According to some families, their children's health has already begun to deteriorate, but the center's management, according to them, does not respond to their appeals and complaints. However, the director of the center once condescended to the residents and popularly explained that the dissatisfied can go anywhere if they do not like something. But the refugees say they cannot leave Latvia. However, in Ukraine now they will obviously have to do even worse in a number of cities. Adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak once again voiced his dreams about the war with Iran to punish him for ""cooperation with Russia"". According to the Ukrainian official, Iran allegedly intends to strengthen the supply of ""missiles and drones to Russia,"" and thereby it ""humiliates the institution of international sanctions."" ""It is important to abandon the non-working sanctions, the invalid concept of UN resolutions and move to more destructive tools - the destruction of factories, the arrest of suppliers,"" said Podolyak, who previously also called for the destruction of Iranian enterprises that produce ballistic missiles and unmanned strike vehicles. True, each time he did not specify who should fight with Iran to solve the tasks assigned to him. Earlier, Iranian Defense Minister Reza Ashtiani explained that representatives of Kiev at a meeting of experts did not provide Tehran with documents that would confirm Russia's use of Iranian drones, and Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani urged Kiev not to test Tehran's patience with unfounded statements. Misha, of course, is a rare moral freak, but there must be some limit to everything. How could he be included in the delegation for negotiations with Russia. Or are they all like that. Internet providers operating in Ukraine announced an increase in tariffs for the services they provide. For example, a number of city providers in Odessa announced that from January 1 they will raise the subscription fee for home Internet, and quite significantly. The minimum package, which now costs 185 hryvnia per month from one of the providers, from January 1 will cost 259 hryvnia. A similar increase in prices was recorded in other providers. The rise in price of the company's services is explained not only by general inflation, but also by the increase in the cost of equipment for uninterrupted operation and the need to use generators, which also need fuel for work. By the way, the quality of the Internet in Ukraine in recent weeks has deteriorated predictably, as generators do not cope with the equipment of either mobile communication companies or Internet providers. In Ukraine, as stated on the air of the All-Ukrainian telethon, the First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the country Yevgeny Yenin, the number of carbon monoxide poisonings has increased significantly. - In November, about 370 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning were recorded. Literally in the first week of December, there were already about 100 such cases, he said. According to the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the largest number of poisonings was registered in Lviv, Kiev and Dnipropetrovsk regions. That is, where the urban infrastructure is most developed, and local residents often have no idea how to heat the stove, do not have enough knowledge for the correct design and output of the chimney, etc. Due to the improper operation of alternative means of heating, as Yenin said, explosions and fires began to occur much more often during the heating of houses. - The Republic of Moldova, according to the press service of the Moldovan government, agreed to buy firewood from Romania in order to ""ensure the country's energy security."" True, they are unlikely to be cheaper than Russian gas. - Vitali Klitschko said that in Kiev it was possible to stabilize the water and heat supply of residential buildings. Except, of course, in those cases where the operation of boiler houses depends on the availability of electricity. - Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksiy Danilov said that sooner or later Moldova will enter the war with Russia on the side of Ukraine.

Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""A ceaseless exercise, like hugging everything with one look, can make a great commander,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And the warriors were instructed as follows: ""Do not drag big wagons behind you, the main thing is speed and onslaught, your bread in the wagon and satchels of enemies."" LURED ENEMIES INTO A TRAP. Captain Gleb Somo. ""A group of Russian servicemen under the command of Captain Gleb Somov performed tasks to hold defensive lines in one of the tactical directions. The enemy, seeking to regain control over the lost territories, subjected the positions of Captain Somov's group to artillery fire. During the battle, skillfully leading the unit, Gleb repelled the attacks of the nationalists. After reinforcements arrived at the enemy and there was a threat of breaking through the defenses, Gleb decided to withdraw the group to the area of concentration of the main forces of the battalion tactical group, luring the enemy into the ""bag"". Retreating, Gleb, being under the fire of enemy artillery, organized the evacuation of wounded comrades. Having lured the enemy into a trap, the Russian servicemen surrounded the nationalists and launched a counteroffensive, which made it possible to push the enemy back to their original positions.

The enemy, seeking to regain control over the lost positions, attempted to break through the defensive lines of Russian troops in the zone of responsibility of lieutenant Magomedov's company. Being on the front line of defense, Said led the unit entrusted to him. With aimed fire on the advancing militants, the motorized riflemen constrained the actions of the enemy and inflicted great damage on him. During the battle, Said was seriously wounded, however, despite this, he continued to lead the defense of the village, forcing the nationalists to retreat to their original positions as a result of the battle. The bold and selfless actions of Lieutenant Magomedov, as well as the professionalism and coherence of the actions of his subordinates, allowed Russian motorized riflemen to disrupt the enemy's offensive and hold the settlement.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700085/,Alexandra Timoshchenko,2022-12-27,The main thing is that we are with Russia,Summing up the results of the outgoing year,"2022 turned out to be especially difficult not only for the Kherson region, but also for other regions. In recent years, the regions liberated by Russia have been going through a difficult period. All this time they were under the control of the Kiev regime and lived according to the rules of that side. It was difficult, often there was not enough money, the children had a good education and free medicine. But since the beginning of March, the life of Kherson residents has been divided into before and after. After years of suffering, they finally have faith in a bright future with Russia. For nine months, despite all the difficulties in conducting a special military operation, much has changed in the new reality. But the best is yet to come. To date, the entire left bank is under the wing of the Russian authorities. People were evacuated there immediately after the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They were provided with accommodation in warm apartments, all the necessary humanitarian assistance and security. Thus, the number of liberated territories of the region has seven cities. Among them are Henichesk, Holaya Pristan, Kakhovka, Novaya Kakhovka, Skadovsk, Tavriysk and Aleshki. The largest are the cities of Nova Kakhovka and Kakhovka, so most people live in them. ""Now we feel safe. Finally, we understand what a peaceful sky over your head and good protection of the army are. Of course, we are worried about the right bank, which has now been captured by the Ukrainian army, but we believe, hope and expect that soon everything will get better and we will be able to return to our homes. And now we help in any way we can, we pray for our defenders and try to think only about the good, - says Olga Parkhomova, a resident of Henichesk. The administration of the Kherson region says that many local residents come to the headquarters just to talk or thank them for helping to organize and hold a referendum at the end of September. Some with tears in their eyes recall that they have long dreamed of this. - I have been waiting for this event for all eight years. For me, it's like coming home, to my native land. Therefore, even in a difficult situation, we remain positive. We believe that everything is not in vain, soon everything will get better, - emphasizes Kherson resident Vladimir. According to the regional administration, to date, about 40 thousand Kherson residents have received Russian passports. Every day the figure is growing, and the queues at passport offices are not decreasing. People continue to draw up documents. With the advent of Russia in the Kherson region, much has changed. According to the indigenous people, if we compare life in Ukraine and now, the progress is obvious. First of all, this applies to salaries and preferential payments. As told to ""KP"" in the local administration, after indexation and an increase in wages, on average, Kherson residents began to earn 20 - 30% more. - There are also professions in which payment has increased by 50% and even by 100%. People felt a lot better. In addition, there are various supporting payments and benefits that help and save a lot, the department added. There are many indicators that the life of Kherson residents has improved. One of them was high-quality free medicine, as well as throughout Russia. Previously, huge sums had to be paid for treatment, so many simply avoided the health care system. It's a very different picture now. According to the Minister of Health of Kherson region Vadim Ilmiev, the hospitals of the region have been working stably according to Russian standards for several months and provide all types of services. The new healthcare system of the region helps to provide medical care free of charge to absolutely everyone, and the presence of Russian citizenship does not matter. - We do not divide people into two groups: with a Russian passport and without it. We treat absolutely all residents of our region free of charge,"" the minister said. Also, thanks to the Russian authorities and the departure of the Kiev regime in the region, tariffs for gas, electricity and food have changed dramatically. These are no longer the unbearable amounts that Kherson residents paid from their minimum wage. After the predatory tariffs of the Kiev regime, utility prices in the region fell almost five times. - The amount of gas that we need for the entire region to ensure the operation of both boiler houses and the household sector, we will now receive from Russia. We do not need Ukrainian gas, we now have our own, Russian, volumes sufficient for all enterprises to work. The most important thing is that this gas is five times cheaper than Ukrainian, - said the head of the administration of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo. According to the regional administration, to date, about 40 thousand Kherson residents have received Russian passports. Every day the figure is growing, and the queues at passport offices are not decreasing. People continue to draw up documents. During the special operation, residents of Kherson region experienced many shocks and losses. But life under the Kiev regime still causes fear and trembling in the body. Locals do not want to return to Ukraine, but, on the contrary, dream that soon tricolors will appear again over their native homes and they will live a calm, peaceful life under the reliable wing of Russia."

Edition ""SB. Belarus Today"" quotes Nazaruk as saying that Belarus has repeatedly become a place for negotiations and resolution of serious conflicts. She is ready to act in this capacity now, this was confirmed by representatives of the Vatican. But given the fact that earlier the White House stated that Minsk is guilty of allowing Moscow to use its territory to deploy Russian forces, and made it possible to hold the SVO in Ukraine, it is unlikely that the Belarusian capital or other city of this wonderful country will be chosen as a ""platform for achieving peace."" They are afraid of the poles and swamps there. The dismantling of the monument to the Russian Empress Catherine II was still made on December 28 in Odessa. In the hero city, from Wednesday morning, an operation was launched to overthrow the monument to Catherine the Great. It was impossible to drive up to the square during the day, everything around was blocked, without allowing either cars or citizens to pass. Confirmed the work on the dismantling of the monument to the founder of Odessa and deputy of the Rada of Ukraine Oleksiy Honcharenko. The decision to demolish was made by the city council of the city near the Black Sea. Earlier, historian Marco Baratto, coordinator of the Leo Tolstoy Independent Cultural Association from the northern Italian region of Lombardy, proposed moving the monument to Catherine II to Milan or Naples. Yes, you can move it anywhere - just do not leave it with these pathetic, insignificant people. The FSB Public Relations Center reported that two militants who were preparing a terrorist attack in Chegem were killed in Kabardino-Balkaria. The task came from the Ukrainian special services. After its commission, they had to move to Ukraine to participate in hostilities against the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. When detained in the suburbs of Nalchik, terrorists, previously convicted citizens of Russia, put up armed resistance. They were destroyed by return fire. They were members of the terrorist community that operated until 2021 in penal colony No. 3 in Kabardino-Balkaria. At the scene of the collision, an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2 kg in TNT equivalent with destructive elements, an AK-74 assault rifle, a PM pistol and ammunition were found. Previously, songs were written about Chegem, and now the security forces issue operational reports. Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that the words of Estonian Prime Minister Kai Kallas about Ukrainian refugees prove the ""dehumanization of the West."" The head of the Cabinet of Ministers said earlier that she opposes the formation on its territory of a community of refugees from Ukraine who do not speak the language of the titular nation. Zakharova wrote in her telegram channel: ""Estonia for Estonians, right? Say it at last, stop rubbing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with sweaty palms."" But in general, hot Estonian guys 80 years ago fought for this simple nationalist idea under the banners of the Third Reich. Years go by, the Balts don't change. Tatyana Sapyan, communications adviser to the State Bureau of Investigation, said that at the request of Kiev, Ukrainian oligarch Konstantin Zhevago was detained in Courchevel, France. According to Sapyan, this humble Ukrainian billionaire is involved in several criminal cases of the Bureau of Investigation. The SBI is now preparing documents for his extradition. In November, the assets of Zhevago and three other independent oligarchs - Igor Kolomoisky, Vyacheslav Boguslaev and Konstantin Grigorishin - with a total value of almost $ 1 billion were nationalized. That is, the remaining three may also soon come - if they do not activate the help of the native victorious army, the unsinkable fleet, and the high-speed Kiev falcons. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that in the area of the village of Krasnogorovka, two American M777 artillery systems, as well as the German howitzer FH-70, were turned into scrap metal. Deadly iron from Western masters was destroyed during a counter-battery struggle in the area of the village of Krasnohorivka in the DPR. These guns shelled residential areas of Donetsk. In general, more than 80 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in the Donetsk direction. This is to talk about ""when and who will answer for the capital of Donbass."" In the second half of Wednesday, distinct sounds of explosions were heard in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine. In this glorious city, by a ridiculous coincidence, almost 45 years ago, a boy Vova was born in a decent Zelensky family. Also on Wednesday afternoon, an air raid alert was announced in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovograd and Mykolaiv regions, as well as in the city of Zaporozhye, which Kiev, according to an incomprehensible tradition, considers Ukrainian. Volodymyr Zelensky, in his pre-New Year's address posted on the president's website, said that 2023 should be decisive in the conflict with Russia. As a true strategist, he knew the risks that could arise on the battlefield in the winter and knew exactly what to do in the spring. In his opinion, in 2023, the citizens of Ukraine need to maintain a common understanding of national goals: the restoration of Ukraine, the return of its citizens home, the rapprochement of the state with key partners, the opening of new opportunities for Ukraine in the world (he saw a prophetic dream?!). And in a video message to Politico, where he topped the ranking of the most influential personalities in Europe in 2022, Zelensky said that the conflict in Ukraine could end in 2023: ""I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year, but in peacetime."" That is, he sees himself as the president of the Galaxy? Or at least the UN Secretary-General? No, peacetime, of course, will come, but without the sixth leader of the independent. After the start of a special military operation, more than 100 thousand residents of the Donbass republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, arrived on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory on their own. According to Vice-Governor Anna Minkova, about 15 thousand people are accommodated in health resorts of the region. All refugee children are provided with places in kindergartens and schools in Kuban. This generation will not lose."

Will it make sense?","Their ""locomotive flies forward"". Or back?","Kiev authorities said that the capital of Ukraine throughout the winter, at least, will be held in the mode of emergency power outages. In the event that there are no more Russian strikes on energy infrastructure. And no one will vouch for the latter. But Ukraine cannot be broken! For every Russian strike, Nezalezhnaya has a response. As expected, asymmetrical. For example, in Lviv, trams are carried along the rails by an ordinary wheeled tractor. And ""Ukrzalyznytsia"" (""Ukrainian Railways"") found, it would seem, a way out of the situation when it is time to scrap electric locomotives, because it is not possible to use them otherwise. Steam locomotives went on the track tracks. Due to the lack of a sufficient fleet of diesel locomotives and the fact that the former Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Omelyan could not build the Hyperloop promised to the villagers. Or still built, but his own, Ukrainian, and we are witnessing its presentation to the people. Just the other day, a video appeared on the Web as two steam locomotives of the ""Er"" series under the ""pull-push"" scheme carry six passenger cars by rail. And each of them on the pediment of the historical red star is replaced by a symbol of ""non-malice of independence"" - a trident. Can we say that soon the whole of Ukraine will switch to steam locomotives? It's unlikely. In Russia, steam locomotives are included in the strategic reserve, and with a certain regularity they are serviced in storage and even check the operation of the mechanisms. But Ukrainian steam locomotives were not lucky - until recently, those of them that were not scrapped during the premiership of Yulia Tymoshenko sprouted weeds on the sludge sites. And it is unlikely that Kiev will be able to scrape together more than a dozen or two steam locomotives that are suitable for operation. And their capacities are not at all the same as those of modern cars. Those locomotives that are in the video, the power of 1300 ""horses"" each. A modern diesel locomotive with two diesel engines produces more than 6100 horsepower on the mountain. With passenger cars, a steam locomotive, and even in pairs, they will cope, but with freight trains or the same military echelons - a prankster, a tramp. In addition, steam locomotives, along with the advantages (you can heat at least with wood, and spare parts can be made in any ""Agricultural machinery with a minimum of machine park""), have drawbacks. And they outweigh. Remember the movie ""His Excellency's Aide-de-Camp""? And how was water poured into the locomotive from a special railway water tower? But this one still needs to be built. And get water in it. And throwing wood and coal with a shovel into the boiler all the time is also not easy. And there should be coal storage facilities at railway stations. And where are the guarantees that the coal will be left to rest quietly until the locomotive, and not pushed or privatized? And the drivers of a steam locomotive and an electric locomotive are completely different professions. For any reason, two dozen steam locomotives will not replace more than one and a half thousand electric locomotives. Therefore, steam locomotives are and will remain Ukrainian exotic. This is a semi-machine on the way of Ukraine from the 21st century to the 19th century or to the beginning of the 20th. Of course, if nezalezhnaya cannot restore the energy infrastructure in this area, for which the Russian military should try to not leave a single chance for a different future. And then horse-drawn carriages and reckless cabs on trotters will again begin to transport passengers through Ukrainian cities, wheelbarrows with atamans and ""Makhno fathers"" in all their Ukrainian diversity will begin to scatter in the fields, and unhurried trade caravans of chumaks on oxen will slowly stretch along the roads. And steam locomotives, if you joke well, in some backward countries of Asia and Africa, can be found. Maybe Washington will also pay for their purchases in a new aid package. Back to the future! Or go back in time. Hyperloop in Ukrainian is a terrible thing. Slow, inefficient, and so that Greta Thunberg would have gone crazy if she had seen this miracle, along with half of the European eco-activists who would have immediately glued themselves to it."

I am a man with some experience of survival... - But why did you go to Donbass through Chechnya. - Back then, we weren't so active in recruiting volunteers. I began to look for options, and it turned out that I had friends in the Akhmat battalion. A former classmate of mine, a platoon leader, suggested, ""Come on, we already have a well-coordinated battle group. If anything, we'll help you, we'll tell you."" And that's what happened. - How you were met in Grozny. - Well received. In general, Akhmat itself is purely Chechen only by a third, the other third are men from other Caucasian regions, another third are Russians from other parts of Russia. There you can meet people from Karelia, from Chukotka, from the Crimea. Mostly from small towns or villages. When I said that I was from St. Petersburg, everyone was surprised: what are you doing here? They say that in St. Petersburg it was possible to sit and not go. - What drove your fellow volunteers. - Different motives. Some, just like me, go for patriotic reasons. The other part is practical. - You're talking about money. - When I came to Akhmat, there was still no certainty about the money. There were a lot of guys who fell under partial mobilization, but did not know to which part they would be sent, to what conditions. And Akhmat is already, so to speak, a brand. There are no problems with equipment and you are under the direct supervision of the Chechen leadership. Age is also different. Mostly 40+ men. But you can find 60+. Such strong Caucasian grandfathers - with beards, serious, solid, who have already fought in all wars, starting with the Afghan one. But there were, of course, ""pioneers"", like me - without experience at all ... - In general, a cross-section of such a society ... - Exactly. You meet a lot of different people, with different motives. But in general, in the army, all this is leveling off. Everyone gets the same goals and objectives. And in general, you become, no matter how pathetic it may sound, brothers. This appeal is purely army - ""brother, brother"", it is quite natural. You divide everything equally. And you share adversity, too, and food. And you help each other. And drag each other if necessary. If suddenly someone is wounded, you need to pull them off the battlefield. Even at the risk of his own life... I was comfortable psychologically. Although at first I expected that I would find myself in an aggressive, alien environment. He was afraid to face half-dedovshchina in relation to non-serving ... However, the attitude turned out to be the most friendly, sympathetic. Everyone helped everyone, tried as hard as they could. - You remember your first combat mission. -Of course. We had a rotation, a week you are in the location of the unit, a week - on a combat mission. And in a month, I had two fights. On the second one, I was hurt. The first way out was that we were sitting in an ambush. They were just in position in case of a possible breakthrough of the enemy to hit him in the flank. The fighting was going on side by side. Mostly there were artillery and mortar duels. Drones flew - a very sneaky thing: he sees you day and night and can drop a grenade ... - And the second combat. - It was a breakthrough, already a real fight. I've only seen this before in a movie about Stalingrad: everything explodes around, and you drive somewhere at random by running from cover to cover... And snipers are working on you... Then somehow everyone gathered, came to their senses, understood what to do... A lot of problems were caused by the enemy tank - it was hammered until dark. We received the task - in the morning to destroy the tank, as soon as it again comes out to nightmare us. At night, we were apparently spotted by a drone with a thermal imager. Sometime around four o'clock in the morning, shelling began. They beat me very accurately. Six were killed by shrapnel - fortunately, no one was killed. And we had to get out of there. I was shot in the thigh by shrapnel. At first, he walked quite cheerfully, leaning on the machine gun like a crutch. But the blood flowed out, you can't pull a tourniquet, because the wound was very high. And now the blood goes away, and with it the strength... Thank God, I had a guy with the call sign ""Alex"" with me - also with a wound in the leg, in the arm, in the lower back. He helped me. If it wasn't for Alex, it would have ended sadly, because I was moving slower and slower. And we must have time before dawn - otherwise we will be in the field at a glance, and we will be finished. And now ""Alex"" almost dragged me to the evacuation point ... And then a few months of hospitals began. As a result, they put me on my feet, only I am no longer a fighter ... - That is, you will not return to the front line. - Hope to go back. At least as a war correspondent. - And on the path of the traveler. -Sure. When it's over. Our victory. KSTAT. - Your rich expedition experience somehow helped you there. - The heaviness of the front for me was not something shocking. As in a tent somewhere in the mountains you sleep in the cold, you can freeze to the bottom, you also sleep in a trench. You know what to use thermal underwear, how to dry, what to take with you. In this regard, yes, expeditionary experience helped. TO YOUR EYES. During treatment in the hospital, Grigory Kubatyan began to record the stories of the guys who had been on the front line and his impressions. Now you can read them in the telegram channel reporter_shturmovik. Here's one of the excerpts. There are so many happy and unhappy coincidences that you begin to believe in fate. A grenade flew into the trench for one soldier. It didn't explode, but it hit my toes. He then walked around with a bandaged swollen thumb and swore that the thighs were now difficult to put on. A guy from our platoon bought himself a helmet and a bronik. And I doubted it, it's very hard to walk in them. But I put it on a combat mission. One piece of shrapnel flew into a helmet, the other into a bronik. He says: the best investment in his life. One soldier was crushed by a bullet that shattered the butt of an assault rifle. He glued everything together, wrapped it in duct tape. And in the next battle, the bullet flew in the same place, and again the butt in the chips."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4699673/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-28,"Either a boy or a vision. In Ukraine, they came up with a new fake about ""Russian barbarism"", but again they fell into trouble",A member of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a photo of a boy from a book published nine years ago as a victim of shelling,"The fact that the production of fakes is put on stream in Ukraine, the media wrote more than once. And the Ukrainians themselves do not give the slightest reason to doubt this. This time, a member of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, co-chairman of the Council of Volunteers under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Lesya Vasylenko, did not slyly wisdom, but used the first thing that came to her hand to present ""proof"" of another ""terrible barbarism of the Russians."" On her Twitter account, she posted a photo of a tattered and obviously unhappy child who is clearly unhappy. The photo is clearly intended for a Western audience, since the caption under it is made in English. - The saddest thing is that there are no more children in Ukraine. Only little men with very adult eyes, even old ones. I am tired of life, even not yet lived, - Vasilenko signed the photo. - In the photo, Mark, 8 years old, has just survived an artillery strike by the Russians. The boy in the photo is really unhappy. Maybe because his name is not Mark, but James, or that in the past 9 years since his appearance in public, he has not grown a centimeter, and has not matured for a month. We explain, in the photo of the Ukrainian MP in her Twitter account, the boy from the cover of the book by the Spanish writer Christina McKenna ""The Forgotten Man"". The book was published in 2013, is not very popular (still sold on Amazon), and it deals with the hard life of the boy James, who found himself in the adoption center with his sister after the death of his parents. Apparently, it was the fact that the book did not become known to a wide range of readers (it was also published in Spanish) that prompted a high-ranking Ukrainian fake girl to use it for her own purposes. And that's nothing new. Long before the outbreak of the current conflict in Ukraine, Western propaganda used the ""bana girl from Aleppo"" to smear Russia and the Syrian authorities. But there at least the girl was a real, albeit a complete puppet, reading out the text dictated to her! And in Ukraine, they have thought of the next step in the movement towards the triumph of complete and absolute cynicism. The boy James was turned into Mark (though not a girl, but the fashion for transgenderism, obviously, has not yet fully conquered the Independent). And before that, they took a pregnant woman to demolition in the Mariupol maternity hospital, trying to pass her off as a victim of the Russian bombing, although they could not hide the truth that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were behind the explosion, as well as behind the explosion of the theater in Mariupol. And they also tried to imagine children who in 2014 in Sloviansk in the subfield hid from Ukrainian shelling, for Ukrainian children near Kharkov, allegedly fleeing from Russian shelling. And then there was Bucha, where the civilians were really killed, but not by the Russians. And there was also the arrival of the Tochka-U rocket at the station in Kramatorsk. And the other day there was shelling of Kherson with a large number of victims among civilians. Moreover, for the blow, the Russians tried to pass off the arrivals of the MIRS ""Highmars"", which the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation did not have. Somehow everything is already quite boring and primitive. Absolutely no fiction. Actually, why try, if for the West it will already come down. They are happy to eat any shit about Russia. They will also smack with pleasure."

In Izyum, Kharkiv region, the street named after Viktor Tsoi was renamed in honor of the vocalist of the group ""Scriabin"" Kuzma Scriabin, who about 7 years ago on his SUV collided with a milk truck. The street, which bore the name of Vladimir Vysotsky, by the decision of local deputies was named after the American billionaire Steve Jobs. And where there were plaques with the name of General Ivan Panfilov, now the inscriptions ""Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel"" will be emblazoned. It is significant that earlier the regional Kharkiv deputies decided that the local academic Russian drama theater would no longer bear the name of Alexander Pushkin. Your serial number is on the sleeve, at the Kanatchikovaya dacha. Grain harvested in the Zaporizhzhya region is enough for everything. Anton Koltsov, the head of the government of the Zaporizhzhya region, said that the region harvested 2.5 million tons of grain and oilseeds. And the food demand of the region is half a million tons. According to Koltsov, the harvest collected in the region is ""five times more"" than the residents of the region themselves can consume. At the same time, the total volume of grain areas sown in 2022 amounted to 1.27 million hectares, which is comparable to the indicators ""under Ukraine"" from the entire territory of the region. Also, almost a fifth of the crops were destroyed as a result of hostilities. Producers of Zaporizhzhya region fully provided the region with milk, bread and meat. And they get hard rubles for them. In the region, the circulation of the hryvnia ceases from January 1, you can exchange them for rubles for three months - until April 1, ""in any branch of the PSB bank and the MRB, so far without limiting the amount."" And the repair of the port of Berdyansk, through which agricultural products can be exported, will begin in 2023. coal supplies are uninterruptedly coming from the DPR, LPR and Kuzbass. In the city of Zaporozhye, they are quietly envious. In the Kherson region, a gunner of the Armed Forces was detained. A resident of the Kherson region, who was under the influence of propaganda posted on aggressively minded Internet resources of the independent country, transmitted data on Russian units to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In particular, she transferred specific points of location of the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to one of the administrators of the Ukrainian nationalist resource. The citizen was detained. This offence carries a penalty of up to 21 years' imprisonment. Yes, madam, this is not a joke of Quarter 95. Lavrov predicted the future independently. Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said that if Ukraine does not comply with Russian demands and continues its ""senseless resistance,"" then its demilitarization and denazification will be provided by the Russian army. According to him, the ""enemy"" is aware of Russian proposals that relate to the demilitarization and denazification of the territories under the control of the Kiev regime, as well as the elimination of threats emanating from there. He noted that this also applies to the issue of security of ""our new lands"": the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions of Russia. As the minister specified, ""it's a matter of small"" - Kiev must ""pick up and say hello"" to fulfill our requirements. There is a feeling that ""picking up"" will not work. Ukrainian losses are monstrous, the head of Akhmat. Apty Alaudinov, commander of the Akhmat special forces, deputy commander of the 2nd Army Corps of the LPR People's Militia, said that since the beginning of the SVO in the territory of the independent loss, Ukrainian forces have approached 200,000 personnel. Alaudinov said: ""Does these sacrifices make sense for us? I don't think so."" He said that the Russian troops intend to ""move forward carefully, but confidently,"" and the only reason slowing down the advance in the Artyomovsky sector is the desire to avoid civilian casualties. In addition, ""some time takes"" the destruction of ""forces and means of the NATO bloc"", ""the front is stable"", and the city ""will be liberated"". In Kiev, they still doubt it, but this always happens for them. The killers of the family in Makiivka turned out to be criminals - and they were detained. The Center for Public Relations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the DPR reported that three suspects in the murder of a family of eight people in Makiivka were detained in the republic. The suspects were detained in hot pursuit. They turned out to be three previously convicted residents of the Kalinin district. They said that they decided to kill, wanting to steal the car and valuables. They shot a family of eight. Presumably, automatic weapons were used. The youngest of the dead was a one-year-old child. Alas, there are scumbags everywhere. Is a ""peace summit"" on Ukraine possible without Russia? Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, said that it is impossible to imagine a ""peace summit"" at the UN without Russia's participation. So he commented on the proposal of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmytro Kuleba to hold a ""peace summit"" by the end of February 2023, as well as the statement that Russia should be excluded from the UN and the Security Council of the international organization. Polyansky said: ""What can be a 'peace summit' without Russia? And without Ukraine, it is very easy to imagine it. And this is exactly what is a nightmare scenario for the kulebs and kislitsa that make such initiatives breed."" Yes, their whole life is a continuous nightmare, and they cannot wake up. The British are preparing ""warriors of light"" through their sleeves. The training of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the British Isles was not at all as intensive as the Ukrainians themselves expected, and the army command did not give them specific instructions. A Ukrainian soldier who was captured by Russian units told how they were trained by the British: ""In Britain, the training took place as: they dug, took us to the training ground, shot, ran in twos or threes. In general, in Zhytomyr, they even dragged us harder."" The prisoner of war also noted that the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not give specific goals, except for ""standing and defending."" According to him, the Ukrainian military was threatened with prison. The servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine wanted to make a ""self-shooter"" to leave the positions. The fighter stressed that they did not have enough food, had to divide one dry ration for two, ""sat in the cold, hunger."" He also mentioned cases where ""two days of one hundred grams of water"" were per person. And they hoped that the British would make James Bonds out of them and then they would feed them like in Casino Royale. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698922/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-27,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 27, 2022: saboteurs on the border near Bryansk and an attempt to exclude Russia from the UN","We have collected the latest news about what is happening around Ukraine on December 27, 2022","The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry made another loud and traditionally empty statement: ""Ukraine calls on the UN member states to resume the application of the UN Charter in matters of legitimacy of the Russian Federation's stay in the UN, deprive the Russian Federation of the status of a permanent member of the UN Security Council and exclude the country from the UN as a whole."" Kiev accuses Moscow of taking the place of a permanent member of the UN Security Council in circumvention of the procedures established by the Charter of the Organization. Kiev also accuses Moscow of using the right of veto in the Security Council and violating the principle of ""peacefulness"". However, the dangerous Ukrainian empty words this time were unanimously ignored both in Europe and in the United States. Marat Khusnullin, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian government, said that the work on the restoration of the road infrastructure of the LPR, planned for 2022, is being completed successfully. Khusnullin said: ""More than 590,000 tons of asphalt concrete mixture have been laid. Markings have been applied. More than 3,000 road signs have been installed."" In the outgoing year, traffic was opened on 8 bridges and overpasses. All these facilities are of great strategic importance and provide uninterrupted and safe transport links with new regions of the country. Here they build competently, there they build illiterately. The FSB Public Relations Center reported that a group of Ukrainian saboteurs was eliminated at the state border when trying to break into the Bryansk region. The collision occurred on December 25. Four people from the DRG were killed. The saboteurs had foreign weapons with them - German SIG Sauer submachine guns, communication and navigation devices, as well as means for committing sabotage and terrorist acts - four improvised explosive devices with a capacity of about 40 kg in TNT equivalent. What these people hoped for was the Order of the Brokeback posthumously. The President of Russia approved the procedure for submitting applications for citizenship for residents of Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. as well as the republics of Donbass. The decree approves the procedures for obtaining Russian citizenship, as well as recognizing children under the age of 14 as citizens of the Russian Federation. The procedure for submitting and recording applications for ""unwillingness to be a citizen of Ukraine"" has also been approved. After the admission of new territories to the Russian Federation, the number of Russians with Ukrainian citizenship increased. At the same time, for reasons beyond their control, these citizens cannot renounce Ukrainian citizenship. But nothing, now they can. Fast enough. And with great pleasure. From January 1, 2023, Kiev increases tariffs for pumping oil through the Druzhba oil pipeline through the territory of the independent by 18.3%. On the website of the company ""Transneft"" it is reported that the tariff for pumping in the direction of Slovakia and Hungary will increase by 2 euros - up to 13.6 euros per ton. Earlier, Bloomberg, citing a letter from Ukrtransnafta, reported that Ukraine in 2023 plans to increase the fee for the transit of Russian oil through Druzhba to Eastern Europe. The reason is the ""ongoing destruction of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" which ""has led to a significant shortage of electricity, an increase in its cost, a shortage of fuel and spare parts."" Well, in general, the reason, of course, is weighty. But it will soon lose its relevance. The sixth president of Ukraine by phone demanded from the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to participate more actively in the implementation of the ""formula for peace"", which the tragicomist voiced at the summit in November. Zelensky wrote in social networks the following: ""I wished Modi a productive chairmanship in the G20. I have announced a formula for peace and look forward to India's participation in its implementation."" At the same time, he thanked India for humanitarian aid and support at the UN. There will be a squirrel for you, there will be a whistle. Ajamu Baraka, an American human rights activist, said that Ukraine ceased to exist as a state, as the United States turned it into cannon fodder to realize its own ambitions. Baraka wrote: ""People, in the name of peace, we cannot continue to pretend that something called a Ukrainian nation or a state with independence and sovereignty really exists."" According to Baraka, this territory lost its independence in February 2014, in order to promote the strategic interests of the United States. Which you have been told for so many years, and few have heard it. Douglas McGregor, a former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, confirms that the Ukrainian army suffered colossal losses. And therefore, as the retired colonel believes, Kiev is forced to send teenagers and the elderly to the front line. McGregor said on his YouTube channel: ""Ukrainians have suffered horrific losses. Thirty-five thousand went missing, more than a hundred thousand died. Now they are trying to mobilize teenagers aged 13, 14 and 15 years, incapacitated people. They're literally scraping away the remnants."" At the same time, the American colonel noted the high training of the Russian military: ""I am impressed by the way the Russians conduct combat operations."" Yes, many are impressed, but the Hitler Youth will not be saved. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698898/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-26,The United States received a savory slap from Ukraine: the monster created by the White House bit the owner,Senators and US President Biden himself received a reprimand from the brazen Kiev.,"When I wrote in the spring that Europeans and Americans did not yet know who they had contacted, who they had chosen as an anti-Russian battering ram, and that they would still pay from the ""gifts"" that the eternally dissatisfied citizens of the independent country would send them, I a) did not think that it would happen with such accuracy, and b) that it would happen so quickly. But the svidom self-stylers ""didn't disappoint"" here either. Former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, a well-known Russophobe Volodymyr Ohryzko, proposed to teach the mind-mind to those members of the US House of Representatives who did not appear at Zelensky's speech in Congress, did not stand up to greet him, or did not applaud during his speech. And there were plenty of them, especially among Republicans. How exactly should they be punished? Ogryzko also came up with this: it is necessary to bring them to Poland, transport them from there to Kiev and give them to the VSUshniki. - And from Kiev, our soldiers would transport them by appropriate means to a place where it is very hot. And if they saw that every day six to ten thousand shells are fired at an average normal pace, and on peak days it goes to tens of thousands, then they would understand where the money of American taxpayers goes, ""Ogryzko said about his methods of educating American parliamentarians. - And let them, perhaps, spend the night with our soldiers in the dugouts somewhere, let them listen to the bullets whistle overhead, how the shells explode. It's really the best form of persuasion that's going on. - Because it's one thing to sit 10,000 kilometers away and think about where the money goes, and it's another thing to visit the front lines. And this, it seems to me, is what our respected embassy in America should do today,"" Ogryzko said in an interview with the Kiev magazine Novoye Vremya, as if he himself had not climbed out of the trenches in the hottest parts of the front for days and weeks. For there is nothing for these congressmen to live there in Washington. They're brazen, you know, they don't get up, they don't bow to the floor, they don't send chelobits when such a person comes out to their podium. And they don't even applaud – what arrogance! Into the corner on the peas on your lap for the night! But let kiev not wonder why congress, in which the Republicans will have a majority after the New Year, will not burn with love for Ukraine. However, congressmen are so, for a warm-up. Former Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Valeriy Chaly on the air of the Kiev TV channel ""Espresso"" charged a savory slap to Biden himself, literally ""running over"" the owner of the White House: ""Jake Sullivan (Biden's national security adviser - approx. author.) should remove the barrier to Joseph Biden in order to provide ATACMS with missiles, 300 kilometers at least, and long-range drones. If that doesn't happen in the coming weeks, I will consider Joseph Biden very dependent on the opinions of some limited number of people."" ""Patriot is not enough for us, let's give us ATACMS!"" However, nothing surprising, most of the psychiatric hospitals in Ukraine were closed by the government, and the fleeing patients with megalomania settled in the local Foreign Ministry. Well, not an incubator for the production of morons there was launched at the time of gaining Independence?. And now there is a lot of performance ""Or else we will write in ""Sportloto"". Created by Pentagon technology, the Ukrainian monster, this ugly homunculus, began to gain independence and bite its Frankenstein without jokes. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (and this is no longer a surname, but a diagnosis) said that Kiev is starting a procedure to exclude Russia not even from the Security Council, but from the UN. And the grandson of the same Stepan ""koshkodava Soply"" Bandera (and his namesake, by the way) announced that troops should be sent to Moscow so that Ukraine would become the winner. And when the West fails to implement their ""wishes"", they will complain about the United States and the European Union somewhere else. Because it was they who molded today's Ukraine from what was. But, except for the known, non-sinking component, at that moment they had nothing at hand. LISTEN AS WELL. How will the course of the special operation change with the onset of the new year"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4698845/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-26,What do Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airfields mean and who is behind them?,This is not the first time that russia's air defense system has shot down Kiev's modernized drones on approach to military facilities.,"Ukraine again struck a drone at a Russian strategic facility. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the aircraft was shot down during approach to the Engels airfield in the Saratov region. Three soldiers died from its wreckage. A similar thing happened on December 5 - then Kiev also tried to hit the Diaghilevo airfield near Ryazan, and the same Engels. In both cases, the drones were also shot down, but in Ryazan, as now in engels, three died from the wreckage. What kind of model of drones was used, is not officially reported. But perhaps these were the same jet reconnaissance targets Tu-141 ""Swift"". These are still Soviet-made devices. How could they overcome air defense systems and fly hundreds of kilometers deep into Russian territory? How to protect yourself from attacks of these devices in the future? We talked about this with military experts. ""It was reconnaissance by combat, an attempt to check what conclusions the Russian defense complex made after the first drone strike,"" military expert, head of the Center for the Study of Military Applied Problems, Alexander Zhilin, said on komsomolskaya Pravda radio. - After all, this drone arrived on the same route as the first time. And this is 650 kilometers across the country. ""Apparently, they were walking at a very low altitude,"" said military expert Vasily Dandykin. - It should be remembered that the same ""Swift"" in March fell, having spent fuel, in Croatia, and the vaunted NATO air defense did not detect it either. We now have the main air defense forces now covering our units that are at the front. But what happened showed that air defense systems should be placed on different frontiers. And it should be not only ""Pantsirs"" and ""Torah"", but also systems such as ""Buk"". During the exercises, our air defense destroyed such targets quite calmly. ""Both Moscow and the so-called Central Industrial District are quite tightly closed with air defense and missile defense systems,"" said KP.RU military expert, Colonel Viktor Baranets. Baranets also believes that the Soviet Strizh rocket targets in Ukraine have been modernized. At the same time, in his opinion, this modernization could not have taken place without the participation of Western special services, otherwise the Swifts would not have been able to overcome such distances. - Look, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine got a large number of Swift rocket targets (about 100 pieces in warehouses). They were able to fly from a force of 300 kilometers. They were launched over the test site to shoot them down during the exercises, - says Viktor Nikolaevich. If the German was not hit, the self-liquidator was activated. But how did it manage to adapt the Swifts to today's fighting. ""You need honor three factors,"" says our military observer. - Firstly, the school of aircraft designers has been preserved in Ukraine (there is a whole Antonov bureau). Secondly, they have an enterprise ""Motor Sich"", capable of supplying these targets with more powerful engines. And thirdly, the British and Americans taught ukrainians to put in these ""Swifts"" a new electronic stuffing that allows them to fly under the control of GPS. Such technologies have existed for a long time. Our Kalibrs act in exactly the same way: they lay detailed maps with the terrain, and they fly to the target as if they were at home. ""If earlier Ukraine could launch missiles for 100-150 kilometers, then with the help of these British and American technologies they were able to hit a thousand kilometers,"" Baranets states. - Remember, in March, the same ""Swift"" collapsed in the Zagreb area. OUR REFERENCE. The length of the ""Swift"" is 14 m, weight - 5. 4 tons. These jet targets made their first flight in 1974. They were intended for reconnaissance at a distance of several hundred kilometers. ""Swift"" was equipped with photo and infrared cameras, flew along a given route. Data transmission by radio was not supposed - after landing, the film had to be picked up and developed. In 1979-1989, 152 such devices were produced at the Kharkov Aircraft Plant. In 2012, the Tu-141 was removed from service, but in 2014 it was returned to the troops. The Armed Forces of Ukraine used it for reconnaissance over the territory of the DPR and LPR. At the same time, it was decided to modernize them - the installation of a modern control and navigation system. Now the use of the Tu-141 as a photo reconnaissance aircraft is no longer relevant, because it is used to open the air defense system, as well as a projectile aircraft. LISTEN AS WELL.

""I understand that this work is not optional, not from time to time. This is the kind of work that requires daily constant attention. I would very much like it to be built in a planned and effective manner. Work is very important and, most importantly, it is not for one day. This must be understood. Problems arise, then they are resolved, other problems arise,"" the Russian Defense Minister said. The head of the Russian military department noted that the idea of creating this coordination group arose almost simultaneously with the beginning of partial mobilization to support servicemen and their families. The President supported this initiative. - We have completed mobilization, partial mobilization. There were a lot of difficulties, a lot of problems. Here I cannot but say that we managed to solve most of the problems and issues quite quickly. Initially, we tried to make sure that we did not hide anything from anyone. There are problems - we need to solve them. For this, I wanted to thank many, - said the head of the military department. Shoigu stressed that every deputy and every senator today represents a certain region and party. And the special operation and mobilization concerns everyone and everyone, every subject and every settlement. ""Of course, we need the help and support of senators and deputies. Those people who are elected from this region, and to whom people have entrusted to represent their region, their city in the Parliament of the country,"" the minister emphasized. Recall that the working group on ensuring the interaction of public authorities and organizations on mobilization training and mobilization, social and legal protection of citizens of the Russian Federation taking part in a special military operation, and members of their families will constantly monitor the provision of mobilized citizens and a number of other issues related to the SVO. Also, the tasks of the group include participation in information and explanatory work on issues related to mobilization training and mobilization, analysis of the state of work on the patriotic education of young people and the preparation of proposals for surveys of the production of products necessary to meet the needs of all types of troops and military formations. The parliamentary coordination group included representatives of both houses of the federal parliament and all parliamentary parties, the Ministry of Defense, leaders of public organizations, leading war correspondents. The working group is headed by First Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council, Secretary of the General Council of United Russia Andrei Turchak."

And to whom? In the village now you can not remove the barn, if there is a stove in it. In addition, in our region, if you speak Russian, it is not that they will not give up the corner, but they will explain where you should go, a Moskal bastard. "" This is a letter from a Russian resident of Kiev in one of the telegram channels. It is anonymous, which is natural: few people will dare to say something like this in the capital of Ukraine. ""The people are angry. Everyone's nerves are at the limit. And patience too, the author continues. - The most stubborn bought calendars and now the days are crossed out: like, we need to hold out ninety days until spring. But most are disheartened. At first, they held on to hatred, they say, we can do it! And now the despondency and devastation. If we are left without light at all, despair will set in. I have no idea what will happen then. I bought flashlights, battery-powered garlands, candles. Bottled water is already in the garage. In the bathroom there is a barrel of two hundred liters. I took out a kerosene heater – happy as an elephant! We prepare for everything. Among themselves, they are increasingly saying that it would be better if the Russians immediately went to Bankova (the street in Kiev where the president's office is located. - Ed.) and the whole team together with Zelya would be ruined, then, you see, they would go to negotiations. It is clear to everyone that Russia cannot be defeated. And you can fight it endlessly. And how many more Ukrainians should die? Von der Leyen said one hundred thousand people were killed. For many, this came as a shock. They don't want to believe, but I think it's true. You drive past the cemetery – just a forest of prapores on the graves! There are already two dead in my class. I try to keep my mood in good shape. I read books. They can be read by candlelight, as in the 19th century. I don't communicate with many people, many have become strangers, not interesting. We have given this letter almost without abbreviations because it is unique. Today in the Ukrainian groups of social networks such revelations because of the ""ribbon"" will not be found. Calling for the elimination of Zelensky is like calling home an SBU brigade. The authorities in Ukraine openly try not to scold. Although no, no, yes it will break through. Here's what another anonymous Kievan writes. ""The power supply has just begun to be established - as ""zahisniki"" (defenders in Ukrainian. - Ed.) again provoke the Russian Federation to missile strikes. And then they will talk in the news about ""all the missiles are shot down"", while you are looking for where to stick food from a sized refrigerator, and where to go to tear - to the nearest park, or still try, as in memes about packages. If I ever meet such a ""bully"" where there are no people or cameras around (in the same park, for example) - I will kill. But for now, they're walking in packs everywhere."" And here is Oleg Filippov from zelensky's small homeland, from Kryvyi Rih. ""Folks, watch Gordon's interview with Bogdan (the former head of the president's office. - Ed.) in which the latter stated that they (the Ze gang) came from another business. You know, right? Uncle blurted out Freudian - they came from one business to another. And now their business is to breed suckers, and suckers are you and me - this is the whole of Ukraine. Thank you, 73 percent of the woeful voters (so many percent voted for Zelensky in the presidential elections. - Ed.)"". But Dnepropetrovsk (in Ukraine this city is called the Dnieper), where the news swept through - they want to demolish the monument to the great pilot Valery Chkalov. ""Delirium,"" a resident of the city Evgeniya Sunzuokhina succinctly reacted to the news. And then another user, a certain Oleksiy Honcharuk slipped a ""tricky question"": ""Well, who is this Chkalov for dnipro?"". Honcharuk, Google will help you, - Evgeniya replied. - For me, he is our history, given which country Ukraine has been a part of since 1919. And who is John McCain or Elizabeth II for Dnipro? Tell me, I don't have to. And why only monuments? You can start with power plants, Khrushchev and Stalinoks, then arrivals will not be needed. I worry about something else: how many barrels of water can be supplied, how many to buy powerbanks for the elderly... Or how is this action or the demolition of a monument to Pushkin different from the burning of books in Nazi Germany or the destruction of churches by the Bolsheviks? For me, nothing.. ""So that during a prolonged power outage in the refrigerator, products do not spoil, put frozen water bottles on the shelves in advance,"" advises Elena Kolesnikova from Kryvyi Rih. ""Our government has played with the sabotage,"" Andriy Stupak, a resident of Kiev, wrote in response. - They're with light. We're blowing off.. Electricity, heat, generators - now the main topic for the whole Ukraine. In the rolling blackouts, many residents see a blatant injustice. They notice that the fan does not pass through everything. It is suspected that while they sit in the dark, the authorities continue to sell electricity abroad, receiving profits. ""Turn off those houses that never turn off at all. Otherwise, they suffocate the same with darkness,"" writes Olga Zamkovets from Poltava. According to popular belief, they do not turn off buildings and offices, in which, for example, mining farms are located, which ""grow"" cryptocurrency. These dealers, they say, pay off from outages online. ""Ul.

It's kind of unfair!. Will Odessa electric transport be replaced by buses that do not need electricity? Here is the answer of an Odessa resident under the nickname Shura Balaganoff: ""Do not hang noodles on your ears and do not hold Odessans for idiots. Bus fares are more expensive, and there is no preferential fare for pensioners. ""The imbalance in the energy systems is created by your greed and mismanagement during the independent years. Transformers are burning, wires sparkle, specialists have been fired, but call centers are multiplying, so that God forbid they do not have to talk to subscribers themselves!"", - this writes the Odessa woman. Poltavateploenergo is pleased to announce that it plans to provide all boiler houses with generators. In addition to the largest - the Aurora boiler house, it needs a whole mini-power plant. ""So are you suggesting that people throw themselves into a power plant, or what? Vera Karemushka asks. - Let the bosses rattle less on their pockets and have enough for everything. Generators are not only light, but also problems. ""A cry for help! In the yard on Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street 65, neighbors installed gasoline generators in garages. The hum is crazy, thundering so that in an apartment with closed windows the glass trembles. The police are not responding. Where to go, who will help?. No one! The owners of the generators will be treated with the only feeling - envy. Such units are even launched in apartments, the whole house is covered with smoke, and nothing. People are more concerned about other dangers. ""Yesterday, a generator was dragged from the fitness club to General Petrov. Today, the situation is the same in the cafe on Semyon Paliya, where two devices were stolen at once, - writes Irina from Odessa. ""I knew they were going to be stolen. They stand on the street unattended. Yes, so expensive now."" Police are calling for measures to be taken to make it impossible to access the devices. But not everyone does. ""Dear residents of Krasnopillya, we have thieves! Yesterday, a generator on Novopartizanskaya Street was stolen from our yard. A big request to anyone who knows or has heard that someone is selling a generator to let us know. After all, they can climb into your yard tomorrow."" Here's more crime news: Kryvyi Rih. Some guy throws a grenade into a dorm. When it first happened, everyone thought it was ""coming."" We prepared to swear by Russia. But it turned out that the unsuccessful lover decided to get even with a competitor womanizer. And weapons are now a dime a dozen in Ukraine. And a bunch of comments. ""With such assholes, Russians are not needed"" - this is the most harmless. But there are also reports that take all other discussions to the background. ""Help me find my son, I pray. Kovalenko Yaroslav Igorovich, 1991 b. 57 brigade, 34 baht. Lost in the area of Bakhmut, not in touch with 30.11"". Such lamentations of desperate people are increasing day by day."

The old fleet was worn out by 80 percent, the cars were constantly breaking down, were under repair, and the equipment did not meet modern requirements. Now everything will change - almost 840 thousand people from this Russian region will receive high-quality and timely treatment. - According to the state contract, the Zaporizhzhya region received 89 new ambulances under the state program by the end of 2022. Of these cars, 29 are produced by the Gorky Automobile Plant. And accordingly, 60 - Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant.

Ambulances are equipped with everything you need. They allow to provide not only emergency medical care, but also to conduct dynamic monitoring of the patient during transportation. All cars have electrocardiographs and defibrillators, as well as common medical supplies. New gurneys, oxygen cylinders, resuscitation bags and birth kits - doctors now have reliable equipment at hand to save lives. Paramedics were especially pleased with class C cars. In fact, this is a hospital on wheels, where you can provide specialized medical care. Such ambulances allow intravenous anesthesia and tracheal incubation. - The filling is good. It will be convenient for both doctors and paramedics to work. There are very cool resuscitation bags, birth kits. They can be worked with very easily. It has everything to help patients. We did not have such complete sets, before everything was purchased separately, and then we assembled ourselves. Of course, it was time-consuming and uncomfortable. Now everything is easier and more comfortable, - said the chief paramedic of the ambulance Peter Alekseev. - Today we have to rebuild the routes of delivery of patients.

They are well aware of the role that participation plays on the road to recovery. - For many young volunteers who decided to connect their professional activities with medicine, such an experience can be a good test of strength, - says Alina Schiller, a student of the Melitopol Medical Profile College and one of the candidates for the post of coordinator of the Zaporizhzhya regional branch of the Medical Volunteers. The public movement plans to actively cooperate with the Ministry of Youth Policy of the Zaporizhzhya region to select volunteers and organize joint events. AND AT THIS TIME. Quality medicine is coming to the region. By the end of the year, the region's healthcare will be integrated into the all-Russian system. A bill on the full inclusion of new regions in the federal medical structure is under consideration by the government. Then it will be submitted to the State Duma and will pass all the stages until the end of 2022. This was told by the Minister of Health Mikhail Murashko. The document reflects the features of integration, which relate to personnel issues, education of doctors, regulation of medical products, features of medical care and compulsory medical insurance."

Christmas trees decorated with balloons with the wishes of children were installed in the Federation Council, in various state administrations and on the sites of the partners of the action. Those who want to fulfill someone's dream remove the ball from the Christmas tree, and the desire that fell out, they realize. Such a mission can be carried out until February 2023. The first wishes of the children from the republic have already been fulfilled. For example, the dream of Vlad from Lugansk, who is now undergoing treatment at the Clinical Hospital of St. Luke, - the boy has a congenital anomaly of the kidneys, was fulfilled by the Vice-Governor of St. Petersburg Oleg Ergashev. He presented the young Luhansk resident with a cherished tablet. Also, the wishes of young residents of the republic will be fulfilled by other statesmen of Russia. First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey Kiriyenko will fulfill the wish of nine-year-old Andrei Rusanov, Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko will give 13-year-old Denis Lezhenin a bicycle, and five-year-old Alexander Shukurov, who is fond of music, a synthesizer. - This year the action is special, as there is an opportunity to help not only children with special needs and health problems, but also to support young fellow citizens from new regions - Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. We must do everything to ensure that every child receives care, attention and warmth, - said Valentina Matvienko. Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev (pictured) will fulfill the wish of a girl from Lugansk, who dreams of visiting St. Petersburg. - She is 11 years old. He dreams of visiting St. Petersburg. And we must fulfill the dream. The city is beautiful. As a person from St. Petersburg, this is doubly pleasant for me,"" Medvedev said. State Duma Deputy Sergei Ten and Honored Military Pilot Hero of Russia Evgeny Zelenov also take part in the action. They will realize the dreams of two residents of Kirovsk. Young Denis asked for a smart watch, and Yaroslav - a wallet. State Duma Deputy Sergei Altukhov will fulfill the dream of 11-year-old Masha Lyzenko. - Miracles always happen to those who believe in them. We will definitely fulfill the wish of the girl Masha. She is probably a very creative person, because she dreams of a set to create jewelry. I will try to give a gift personally on the eve of the New Year or transfer it with the assistants of Santa Claus,"" Lyzenko said. REFERENCE ""KP.

Over the past four years, the project fulfilled 59,450 wishes of children and the elderly for a total amount of over 700 million rubles.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700113/,Victor BARANETS,2022-12-27,"General Armageddon's ""Deadly Millstones""",New tactics bring good results on the battlefield,"Soon after the appointment of Army General Sergei Surovikin as commander of the Special Military Operation (SVO), many Russian and foreign experts and analysts spoke almost unanimously about the fact that the tactics of our troops were becoming more effective. The essence of the new strategy of the Russian military command is a war of attrition of the enemy. Kiev generals no longer hesitate to publicly ""complain"" that Surovikin's army is shackling Ukrainian troops and preventing them from regrouping by their actions. And this ""exhausts the armed forces of Ukraine."" Our joint grouping of troops (reinforced by partial mobilization) is increasingly turning into a kind of ""millstones"" that slowly but powerfully grind Ukrainian units at the front and in the rear. There are growing signs that the Ukrainian army is being driven into a critical situation - since November, its military reserves have been destroyed faster than they can be replenished. This is the first time this has been observed since the beginning of CBO. However, not only this is happening for the first time. The staff of General Surovikin began to use cunning tactics during missile strikes on the enemy. Before the launch of Kalibr, for example, false targets that simulate an attack go into the sky. Ukrainian air defense systems are hitting them, wasting their resource. And when real Kalibr arrive, there is often nothing to shoot at them. While the reloading is underway, Ukrainian targets are already covered. Another touch to the commander's style of General Surovikin is to use the capabilities of our weapons to the fullest. This is also about new moments in the tactics of our group's actions. Here is an illustrative example: even before Surovikin headed the SVO, it was established that in the area of the village of Kamenka, the enemy settled in powerfully fortified positions. Even our artillery and air strikes did not help to ""smoke out"" the enemy from under the reinforced concrete shelters. The offensive of our units in this direction ""trampled on the spot"". And then Surovikin ordered to inflict maximum damage to the enemy to strike with a heavy flamethrower system TOS-1A ""Solntsepek"". Powerful thermobaric ammunition caused significant damage to the positions of the Ukrainian military. And the way to the offensive was open. The great merit of Surovikin in changing the course of the special operation is recognized by Western and Ukrainian military experts and the media. The British edition of The Telegraph, for example, wrote about it this way. Russian military commander Surovikin has stabilized Russia's front line in Ukraine since coming to power in October and brought discipline to the Kremlin army. The general demonstrates a high capacity for organization and cruelty."" Ukrainian military expert Oleg Starikov on the air of the Internet channel ""Yes it is so"" said. - Surovikin seized the initiative and grinds our reserves. They dragged us into a war of attrition, Ukraine was moving away from it. For all nine months of the war, we used mobile defense. When the enemy advances, we sit and defend ourselves. In three echelons. The first, second and third defensive echelons. If you have already surrounded - go to the second. Now, unfortunately, we have moved away from that. They dragged us in, it turns out that Bakhmut is now devouring all our resources. All the resources that were prepared for the plans of the General Staff, which, we said, a counteroffensive operation was possible, they are thrown there and grinded. This is Russia, this is their General Staff, General Surovikin seized the initiative. And we succumbed to that. Surovikin induced discipline, and the troops began to perform the tasks that their commander set. And we didn't get it. The Wall Street Journal, who visited Ukraine, report that some of the most powerful artillery systems that the West has transferred to Ukraine have long been out of the battlefield due to complex maintenance procedures and quarrels between European allies. The biggest problems are experienced by heavy artillery. In some cases, the complexity of weapons or the secrecy of technology forces maintenance and repairs in NATO countries. According to Ukrainian and Western military officials, in the event of a breakdown of the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled gun, the French Caesar self-propelled gun or the American M777 gun, in about 90% of cases, the service will take place outside Ukraine. Now less than half of the 19 German PzH2000 self-propelled artillery guns transferred to Ukraine are on the battlefield, and the repair of broken ones has been carried out in Lithuania for a long time. And back in November, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that due to planning errors, there were not enough spare parts to repair these self-propelled guns and therefore it was necessary to disassemble one of the Lithuanian ones. The APU fires about 300 rounds of shells per day from the PzH2000 instead of the recommended 100, which causes severe wear and tear on the gun systems. And at the same time leads to zero and the accuracy of fire on the Russians. The U.S. and Britain maintain the weapons they have transferred to Ukraine in Poland, near the Ukrainian border. Then, in November, The New York Times wrote (referring to representatives of the US Department of Defense) that a third of the approximately 350 Western-made howitzers transferred to Ukraine could fail at any time. Especially after the shelling from the Russian side. The Wall Street Journal in its article mentions the ""piquant moment"". It turns out that Poland refused to allow Germany to create a service center for the repair of weapons on its territory. Instead, Warsaw demanded that German manufacturers disclose the technology to a Polish state-owned company that would perform the repairs. But Berlin disagreed. After bickering with the Poles, Germany made the same request to Slovakia, which agreed to host a service center. What does all this mean? The fact that the West is ready to wage a protracted war with us with the hands of Ukrainians. And we have to be ready for that. THAT TIME. Vladimir Putin personally learned the latest news from the Russian military from the SV zone. The Russian president received detailed information about the course of a special military operation in Ukraine. The head of state worked throughout the day in the joint headquarters of the branches of the armed forces involved in the special military operation. The President got acquainted with the work of the headquarters, heard a report on the progress of the CBO, and also held a meeting and separate meetings with commanders, TASS notes. Details of Putin's meeting with representatives of the High Russian Military Command are not given."

According to the military department, the minister made most of the test visit in the CVO zone by helicopter. Judging by a very brief video, Shoigu flew over the forward positions, and at that time he received oral reports on the state of affairs in this zone of action of Russian troops. It was about the situation in the Southern Group. Later, the minister talked with servicemen at the forward positions. He was personally able to see how the life of the fighters in the zone of direct contact with the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is arranged. The Ministry of Defense stressed that the closest attention of the head of the Russian military department during this inspection was paid to the comprehensive support of the military grouping. Sergei Shoigu was able to see in what conditions the personnel participating in the battles serve. The minister saw how well the fighters were provided with everything they needed. And how well the work of medical care and rear units is debugged. And he drew the appropriate conclusions."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700262/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-29,Ukraine betrayed itself in the night. And he will not be able to stop,The monument to Catherine II in Odessa is demolished for the second time,"Last night in Odessa, monuments to the ""Founders of Odessa"" (popularly called a monument to Catherine II) and the brilliant Russian commander, who for his entire military career did not lose a single battle - Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, were demolished. Demolished, as befits a thief, at night, secretly, so that the townspeople in the morning would simply accept it as an already established fact. Pushing to the monuments not only special equipment and workers, but mass police forces that literally cordoned off the places of implementation of the legalized state Ukrainian barbarism. In order to, as the modern Ukrainian Nazis in power say, finally sever all ties with the ""Russian World"" and with Russia. The current moral freaks, who by the will of fate and the West have ascended to the leadership of Ukraine, which has become a non-country, are hardly able, due to the squalor of their intellect, to realize that by such actions they are not so much breaking with Russia as betraying Ukraine itself. Let me remind you that the monument to the ""Founders of Odessa"" was already demolished by the Bolsheviks in 1920, when many monuments and even entire architectural complexes in Russia went into oblivion after the use of explosives and scraps. But it was a barbarism of the moment, after getting rid of, as it was believed, from the unjust system that oppressed all the peoples of the empire. Much, and not only material, of the heritage was later restored, partly, by the way, by the Communists themselves. Similarly, the monument to Catherine II in Odessa was restored in 2007, because in that Ukraine they realized that it was impossible to rewrite history. And probably because it's just beautiful and is a cultural treasure and attraction. By the way, the monument was then restored by the Ukrainians themselves without any interference from Russia or the Russians. The sponsor was the Odessa businessman. That is why the demolition of the monument was a betrayal of the Ukraine that existed not only before, but also after gaining independence (Independence). But according to the same logic, after the monuments in Odessa, it should be the turn of the main symbol of Kiev itself in the whole world – the monument to Bohdan Khmelnitsky on Sophia Square in the capital of Ukraine. After all, this monument was once decorated with tablets with inscriptions ""To Bogdan Khmelnitsky - a single indivisible Russia"" and ""Will under the Tsar of the Eastern Orthodox"". And the hetman himself, after all, it was he who led the self-styled people to the hand of the same Catherine. Yes, he hesitated along with the line of the gentry, tried to sell his services to one side or the other, but when it was just a question of survival, he made a completely unambiguous choice. And after all, he did not just agree - for several years, together with the Ukrainian gentry, he literally begged the Empress to take these lands and the population under ""his hand"". According to the logic of the current Ukrainians, if the traitor Hetman Mazepa became a hero, then the hero Hetman Khmelnytsky simply must turn into a traitor and a zradnik. And his place on Sophia Square should be taken by Mazepa, preferably with the Order of Judas around his neck. And there is no place in today's Ukraine for monuments to such people. All these Zelenskys, Yermaks, Podolyaks, Arresters, Shmyli and other understatements (in terms of the scale of the personality) are simply not able to appreciate the greatness of real historical figures. Probably, the only thing that they can feel for those to whom the monument is erected is the hatred and envy of small evil souls for the truly great. And they are also afraid, because the monuments remind of the true greatness of the country in which the great city was once founded and lived an enviable life. To whom the current government has prepared the fate of an ordinary multi-storey farm. No, the current government could not put up with such monuments in any way. It's as if Lilliputians lived next to a monument to Gulliver, which from generation to generation would raise a number of uncomfortable questions from others. And there and to other heroes the turn will come. To Kozhedub, Kovpak, Cat, to hundreds of real heroes. It will definitely come. Because once you have stepped on the path of betrayal of yourself and your history, it is impossible to stop. And there will only be a further dive deeper and deeper. As for these monuments, they will definitely be restored to their historical sites. When Odessa will again become a Russian city. READ ALSO.

Also in the city, the monument to Empress Catherine II is being dismantled (more. in Odessa, they began to dismantle the monument to Catherine I.

The most important thing happened - the region became part of Russia. This step was followed by a whole chain of positive changes. So, we talk about the main results of the outgoing year. In just a few months, it was possible to revive the work of light industry enterprises of the Zaporizhzhya region by 50 percent. In March, according to experts, all factories in the region will begin to work. Today, four light industry enterprises are operating at full capacity. - Four have started work. The remaining five cannot yet start production, since the corps are located near the areas of combat contact, - said the acting governor of the Zaporozhye region Yevhen Balitsky. At the moment, there are factories ""Slavic Fluff"", garment factories in Melitopol and Berdyansk and a highly specialized Tokmak garment factory. At the enterprise ""Slavic Fluff"" the production of soft equipment has been established: pillows and blankets. In Berdyansk, they sew overalls, in the future - to establish the production of knitted products. At the Tokmak garment factory, they work with heavy fabrics. The Melitopol garment factory is also actively involved in the work, the sewing shop is already producing overalls. In the launch mode there is a second workshop - for the production of knitwear. The volume of output in the Melitopol fish shop has tripled. If earlier 20 tons of fish and seafood were processed here every month, today this figure is 60 tons, there are plans to increase production to 80 tons per month. Foundry production is being restored. Four of the five enterprises included in the cluster are already operating at full capacity. These are the Melitopol Plant of Automobile and Tractor Spare Parts, two enterprises ""Hydrosila"" and the Melitopol Foundry. - In January 2023, it is planned to put into operation the Tauride Foundry Company ""Talco"", - said acting Governor Yevgeny Balitsky. The Melitopol foundry began to work quite recently, but has already received the first orders from other regions of the country and even from Belarus. There was a real breakthrough in medicine. For the first time in many years, children underwent a full and free medical examination. Doctors examined 20 thousand children. Every day, doctors examine 600 - 800 schoolchildren. Such figures were given by the Director of the Department of Health of the Administration of the Zaporozhye region Viktor Kuchkovoy. In addition, the ambulance fleet in Melitopol has been updated by almost half. The regional center for emergency medical care and disaster medicine received 89 new cars equipped in accordance with Russian standards. - These machines are gradually being brought to the line and serve the population of the Zaporozhye region in the amount of 830 thousand people. There are quite enough ambulances, given that in total our fleet has 169 cars, - said the head doctor of the GbUZ ""Melitopol Regional Center for Emergency Medical Care and Disaster Medicine"" Yuri Reznichenko. In addition, now residents of the region receive medical care free of charge. A bi-currency regime is still in force in the region until the end of the year. From January 1, it will be possible to pay for purchases and services only in rubles. The region is now still independent of Ukrainian gas. The houses of residents of the region, to whom the Kiev regime blocked the supply of blue fuel, are connected to this resource. Moreover, gas is now four times cheaper than before. Those people who have stove heating in the house for the first time began to receive coal for free. More than a thousand people have already received it. The harvest campaign was a success. From 961 thousand hectares, about two and a half million tons of the crop were harvested. In addition, preparations for the 2023 sowing campaign have begun. The restoration of the forest fund has also begun in the region. So, on the territory of the Staroberdyansk forestry, near the village of Voznesenka, on an area of more than four hectares, 20 thousand seedlings of elm, ash and maple were planted. Despite the fact that a lot of work has been done, next year the authorities set themselves no less ambitious tasks that will certainly be fulfilled."

In the course of a special military operation (SVO), the entire territory of the republic occupied by the Kiev regime was liberated. Industry and agriculture are being revived, and the well-being of citizens is growing. July 3 became a new Victory Day for the LPR. On this day, the territory of the republic was completely liberated from Ukrainian occupation. Units of the People's Militia of the LPR, together with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, established full control over the city of Lisichansk and the nearby settlements of Belogorovka, Novodruzhesk, Maloryazantsevo and Belaya Gora. During the year, there was a significant increase in wages in the LPR. This happened largely due to the increase in the minimum wage (SMIC). From January 1, 2022, the minimum wage in the republic increased by 2785 rubles - up to 10,245 rubles. Since September 30, after the admission of the LPR to Russia, the minimum wage is 15,279 rubles - as in the entire territory of the Russian Federation. The growth of pensions did not lag behind the salary. From January 1, 2022, their size was increased by 20 percent. At the same time, the minimum pension was 7885 rubles. From July 1, the payment was increased to 10 thousand rubles. Also this year, social benefits have increased - from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the category. Now pensioners from the LPR receive payments in accordance with the legislation of the republic. The pension system under Russian laws will begin to apply from January 2023. The budget of the LPR for the next year will be socially oriented. It is also expected that the budget of the LPR will be increased taking into account the need to restore damaged facilities and the economic potential of the region. The Ministry of Economic Development of the LPR compared the data for 9 months with the same period last year. In the processing industry, production increased primarily due to the dynamic development of metallurgy. The production of steel without semi-finished products obtained by continuous casting increased by 4.9 times. Production of ferroalloys increased by 36%. The volume of industrial products sold increased by 1.9 times. The main contribution to the improvement of dynamics was made by the processing industry. There is an increase of 2.8 times (see the rubric ""Specifically"". After the adoption last year in Russia of decisions facilitating the work of Donbass enterprises in the territory of the Russian Federation, the foreign trade turnover of the LPR increased by 1.8 times. At the same time, the volume of exports increased by 2.6 times, the volume of imports - by 1.6 times. Positive changes in the LPR would not have been possible without the help of other regions of Russia, which took patronage over every city and district of the republic. Tens of thousands of Russians came to Donbass,  to rebuild roads, homes, schools, kindergartens, hospitals and other social and cultural sites. In fact, the entire republic turned into a large construction site. The head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, noted that, retreating, Ukrainian militants destroyed everything in their path, leaving scorched earth, and the Russian Federation confirms its life principle that Russia does not abandon its own. In Lugansk, the educational complex named after the pilot-cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy, damaged in 2014, was restored (it housed a gymnasium and a kindergarten). After the Ukrainian shelling in the central part of the building, the ceilings on all four floors collapsed. In the capital of the LPR for many years they did not dare to start restoring such a critically damaged object. Back in the summer, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin came to Lugansk, who, as chiefs, promised to help with the repair and equipping of the school. He kept his word - 1.5 thousand builders and about 350 units of equipment worked on the restoration of the facility. Builders from Moscow not only repaired the educational complex, but also laid in it all the modern functionality inherent in the capital's schools. Thanks to the region-chief of the Tyumen region, bright sports and playgrounds, a gym with new simulators, horizontal bars and power structures, modern ophthalmological and physiotherapy rooms appeared in the Krasnodon special (correctional) primary school - kindergarten. Pupils of the educational institution are children with visual impairment and the musculoskeletal system. Here, children not only study, but also undergo procedures, are treated, which allows them to successfully integrate into society in the future. In total, builders from different regions of Russia overhauled 46 kindergartens on the territory of the LPR. Another 13 plan to complete repairs before the end of the year."

The youth of the new regions of Russia also joined the powerful creative wave. A delegation from the Kherson region was sent to the congress in a solemn atmosphere. The event was attended by children from all over the Kherson region: from Skadovsk, Primorsky, Henichesk and other settlements. A three-day intensive was waiting for the activist children. According to the representative of the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs in the Kherson region Denis Tatarchenko, the best specialists of Russia were engaged with the guys in a variety of thematic areas - ecology and science, art industry and journalism, social studies and many others. The delegates of the First Congress of the Russian Movement of Children and Youth are confident that by joint efforts they will be able to form a genuine partnership and a sense of responsibility for the key decisions that will be made at the congress. And yet each of them joined the RDDM and came to Moscow to get one step closer to their dream. For example, one of the members of the delegation - Maxim, a student of the 10th grade of the Kherson school, dreams of entering Moscow State University and devoting his life to nuclear physics. - I've always been interested in technology. For example, building a nuclear reactor is mine! I hope my dream will come true, and I will be able to make a successful career in Russia, because there are all opportunities for this. Student Sofia also shared her impressions of the congress. - This is a great opportunity to exchange experiences, get bright emotions, in principle, gain an understanding of what you want, and make new acquaintances that will help you in life in the future. However, for Sofia herself, the question of choosing a future lesson is no longer worth it. She wants to volunteer - to help lonely old people and abandoned animals. She came to the congress to get the necessary knowledge to create such a project. The uniqueness of the movement lies precisely in the flexible system, on the basis of which girls and boys have broad prospects to develop in any direction. You can play sports or try yourself in creativity or volunteering, science or the creative industry. At the same time, the organization provides all opportunities for the implementation of the set goals, both resource and infrastructural. - I myself was once in the pioneers and I remember what an active and rich life we had, we never sat idle, - shares her opinion the teacher-mentor of the Kherson delegation Olena Viktorovna. - And I want our children to be charged at the congress with positive and share it with other children.

And in order for them to come true for sure, on the eve of the New Year, a charity event ""Tree of Wishes"" is held throughout Russia. For five years in a row, wizards have helped to make seriously ill children, orphans, the elderly and the poor a little happier. This year, the action takes place in the new Russian territories. According to Alla Barkhatnova, Acting Minister of Labor and Social Policy of Kherson region, children aged three to seventeen years who are registered in the territory of Kherson, Zaporozhye regions, Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics became participants of the good project. You can still apply before December 20. The children's dreams are fulfilled by ""wizards"" who have registered in the New Year's project and received lists of what the children dream about. Desires can be tangible and immaterial. Among the first participants of the ""Christmas Tree"" often make up toys, computers, laptops, tablets for training, clothes or even sports equipment. But also someone asks to give a cherished trip, a meeting with an idol or a smile of a mother. For every wish there is a ""wizard"" who fulfills it. One of the participants of the action was a resident of Kherson Elvira. Now she is 15 years old, and from a very young age she loves to read. When she was five, she and her parents in the kitchen read aloud Harry Potter, The Little Prince, and many other children's books. When the home library began to burst with a huge number of different volumes, and there was no longer enough money for new ones, Elvira began to dream of an e-book. But the parents did not have money for the device, so they as a family turned to the volunteers of the ""Wish Tree-2022"". - I want my favorite books to fit in one small device, so that you can at any time open and read some good moment from your favorite fairy tale or novel, laugh at the books of Ilf and Petrov. Now, in order to read a new book, I have to save up for several months for it or wait for my parents to be able to give it to me,"" the schoolgirl told KP. According to Elvira, sometimes she borrows books from classmates or friends from the yard, but after a few days they usually asked them back, it is rare to enjoy her favorite volume or edition. - That's why I asked my ""wizard"" for an e-book. I have been dreaming about it for several years and I really hope that someday it will come true. I believe everything will work out, and I will be able to enjoy new books again and again, - says the teenager. In the future, Elvira plans to become a writer. Inspired by her favorite authors, she sometimes writes short stories or poems and dedicates them to her family. Among the participants of the action was also a large family of Glazkovs. Her application for the project website was sent by the mother of four children Anna. In the letter, she asked for a Christmas tree to give the children a festive atmosphere. - My children have always dreamed of a large and lush green beauty in an apartment, but my husband and I are not able to buy a two-meter Christmas tree - there are not enough funds. But the children ask, and it hurts us to refuse them, so they turned to the website of the volunteer action. We believe and hope that our dream will become a reality, - says a resident of Kherson. She also added that a few days after the publication of the application, she was found by a ""wizard"" who promised to buy the most beautiful Christmas tree in the region and install it in the family's apartment. A magnificent two-meter beauty should appear in the house of the Glazkovs in the twenties of December."

At the solemn ceremony, laureates in 13 nominations were announced. Among those who received the honorary award is a member of the Public Chamber of Russia, Head of the Department of Journalism and Media Communications of Kherson State University Alexander Malkevich. He became the best in the nomination ""New Horizons"". He was noted for the great work he did in the liberated territories. Thanks to Malkevich, residents of Kherson and Zaporizhia regions are no longer isolated from the truth. A well-known Russian journalist has been working in the territory of new subjects of Russia for more than six months. And, in fact, he became a mentor for the regional media. The Kiev regime organized a merciless information war. Ukrainian journalists did not shy away from anything - in an effort to confuse civilians online, they spread a variety of messages, sometimes with threats and intimidation. - People here lived for at least eight years under the most severe information pressure. Since February 24, the situation has become quite terrible - they were nightmarished through social networks, there was a real information terror, complete disinformation. What happened in Ukraine was mentioned in ""pink colors"", but the main fakes, of course, were about how bad everything is in Russia and in its new territories, - explained Alexander Malkevich, how people lived in Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. - And in order to break through this information blockade, to break the shackles of lies, there must be media here that will tell what is really happening. Actually, for this purpose television broadcasting was launched. Alexander is one of the few Russian journalists who is regularly in the combat zone. He sees with his own eyes what is happening and how Ukrainian propaganda interprets it. In the summer of this year, he managed the impossible - in two weeks he created and launched a round-the-clock TV channel in the Zaporozhye region. Such a launch of the modern broadcasting format, without exaggeration, is a real feat. In addition, Alexander managed to prepare and open a TV channel in the Kherson region in a month. After all, right now it is important for people to learn the truth about all the changes in their lives. - Those who helped in this huge work are peacetime heroes! - Alexander Malkevich has repeatedly stated. And now the Iron Curtain of Ukrainian propaganda, according to the journalist, is almost destroyed. - We started this difficult, but historically important path from the Zaporizhzhya region, opening the ZaTV channel on August 1. Then we began to return to Kherson residents the realization of the fact that ""the people of Kherson are the pride of Russia"" by placing a number of ""historical"" billboards,"" said Alexander Malkevich. - Our first youth Media School in Kherson in the liberated territories made it clear to everyone that young people here stand and work for Russia. Thus, Alexander rightfully received a well-deserved award as the creator of an effective educational infrastructure for the training of journalistic personnel in the places that are extremely necessary for this. In his speech at the award ceremony, Alexander Malkevich thanked the journalists who work in the new regions of Russia, and also spoke about the task facing the media now. ""We have a historically fascinating task ahead of us - to tell the residents of four new regions, and this is five million citizens of the Russian Federation, about what it is, our Russia,"" Alexander Malkevich emphasized. - To tell how they live there, about the amazing cities founded by Russian commanders, statesmen, about the amazing people who were born there and became part of history."

This will not even be a step, but a leap into the future, - said the acting governor of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo. As the head of the Kherson region added, it is planned to complete the important construction in a short time - ""we will kindly compete with Mariupol, who will build new quarters faster.""

What will change in 2023? We are talking about this with the Minister of Social Protection of the Administration of kherson region Alla Barkhatnova. - Alla Viktorovna, what people could count on initially. - Pension - it is the same for everyone, in the amount of 10 thousand. Any person who has reached the age of 60, a woman, a man, has the right to receive a pension. If a person has a work experience of more than 15 years, he receives a pension in the Pension Fund. If there is no work experience, he comes to our ministry and receives a social pension also in the amount of 10 thousand. - Let's start with the most common and popular - with child payments. - For families, support is offered under the following conditions - in case of pregnancy, at the birth of a child, during the care of a baby, low-income, maternity capital. Such benefits will increase from January 1 and February 1, 2023, their size and conditions for receipt will change. In granting maternity benefit, the woman's basic earnings for the previous two years will be taken into account. The minimum that she can count on is the minimum wage in the region, the maximum is 2735 rubles per day. When registering for pregnancy, a woman will receive up to 50 percent of the subsistence minimum in the region. One-time allowance at the birth of a child - 20 thousand 472 rubles. Do not forget to add the regional coefficient. Indexation of these payments is mandatory, preliminarily by 3 to 4 percent. As a result, mommy will be able to count on the amount of about 21 thousand rubles. When calculating the benefit for caring for a child up to one and a half years, the basic salary is taken into account - 40% of the average monthly income for the last 2 years. We consider - a minimum of 7670 (+ regional coefficient), and this payment is also indexed. - Low-income families are also seriously helped. In such families, a child under three years of age is entitled to 100 percent of the children's subsistence minimum in the region. If there is a schoolchild in the family up to 7 years old - from 50 to 100 percent, up to 18 years old - too. - Let's not forget about the maternity capital. - What is familiar to residents of the rest of Russia has not been applied in the new territories before. Such an innovation in the Kherson region from January 1, 2023 will be the maternity capital. After the birth of the first child, it will be possible to get almost 590 thousand rubles, for the second - an additional 190 thousand. If the second child was born, then the entire amount is 780 thousand rubles. - For other benefits, payments will also increase. -Yes. The temporary disability benefit will be increased from February 1 by about 12 percent, that is, by the level of inflation. There is also a natural benefit for this category of residents - this is a free connection of gas, telephone, preferential travel in public transport, to a sanatorium. Social benefits will also be increased. In particular, we are talking about a special allowance for burial, it is 10 thousand rubles. Another special payment is related to pensions. After the death of an elderly person, part of the funds that he could not receive is transferred to relatives living with him at the time of his death. They are not indexed in the usual sense, but pensions themselves are growing, and compensation to relatives will also increase."

Doctors and parents are sure that the health of children is invaluable, so annual professional examinations are extremely important and necessary. - Doctors examine for free what else is needed.

Thanks to our doctors and those who come from other regions of Russia, - thanks the father of the preschooler Alexander Peskov. The percentage of refusal from medical examinations is small, mainly due to the fact that now the season of SARS and children do not go to school. - Professional examinations in our institution are calm - the situation is working. The number of refusals of parents from medical examination is minimal. Some of them are simply related to the fact that students are currently sick and, accordingly, do not attend classes, - confirmed the director of the Rykovo school. - Failure rate - no more than 3%. Your children's health is priceless. Do not doubt - bring children for examinations, - added the head doctor of the Skadovsk Central City Hospital Konstantin Rudenko. At medical examinations, parents can also be present at their request. Some moms and dads would like to discuss their concerns with doctors. - Almost all parents of our students agreed to a professional examination of their children. Doctors examined 80 people. Parents came to find out the results of the examination, consulted with doctors, - said the director of the Genichesk Medical College Anna Grekova."

Letters with kind words in the form of soldier's triangles, children's drawings and sweets began to be accepted in advance in order to have time to send to the front line to our fighters.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700826/,Alexander GRISHIN,2022-12-30,Ukraine splits Poland into two camps,Dissatisfaction with refugees among the local population and adequate politicians is becoming more and more,"Notable stories come from Poland, one is more beautiful than the other. And there is nothing strange in the fact that they are somehow connected with Ukraine. It is in this country that one of the most powerful support systems for Ukrainian refugees is still operating, which begins, especially in combination with the behavior of a very large number of representatives of this category of displaced persons, an increasing indignation among the Polish population. Poles are dissatisfied with the fact that a number of services are provided to Ukrainians free of charge, that ""rabies"" climb everywhere without waiting in line, demand preferences inaccessible to Polish citizens, and so on. And also that Ukrainians who have received shelter in Poland for any reason begin to express dissatisfaction with the insufficient level of comfort that is provided to them. Poles not only express this indignation in social networks and in comments to various texts on the Ukrainian topic in the media, but also transfer to the sphere of trade and the provision of services. So, many owners of residential real estate, for example, refuse to rent their apartments and houses to citizens of Ukraine. Moreover, they write in the ads for the delivery of an apartment: ""I do not consider refugees from Ukraine. Even with double rent! Even with a child. The last time after renting out the apartment, two young Ukrainians had to make cosmetic repairs and repair the bed they broke."" The latest information even leads to certain conclusions, given that the apartment has at least two bedrooms. "" To some extent, this is reminiscent of the announcements on the doors of restaurants in Lviv before the Second World War and in tram cars: ""Entrance with dogs and Ukrainians is prohibited."" But note, there is not a word about the ban on the residence of animals in the ad of the owner of the apartment. Clear discrimination on the basis of Ukrainian nationality. But to some extent, the cotton tenants were even intelligent, by their local standards. Only the bed was broken, but, for example, the shit of the wall was not painted, as many of their fellow tribesmen used to do, carrying out their revenge on the Europeans for insufficient additional help on their part. Although, on the other hand, cosmetic repairs still had to be done, so there can be various options. But the most interesting thing in this whole process is that the split of Poland in Ukraine has reached from the broad masses of the people to the upper echelons of power. Indicative in this regard is the real scandal that recently happened in the Polish parliament. A well-known Polish deputy of the Sejm, nationalist Grzegorz Braun from the rostrum of the parliament called to stop the Ukrainization of Poland. But after he called for an end to the flow of refugees from Ukraine to Poland, he was actually driven from the rostrum by the deputy speaker of the Sejm, Małgorzata Gosiewska, who threw a tantrum. - To Moscow! (To Moscow – author's note)) Go to Moscow! Don't like Ukrainian migrants? To Moscow! To Moscow! - Literally began to squeal and scream into the microphone this unrestrained lady. The Poles themselves expressed their opinion on the Ukrainian problems very expressively, and not with words, but with their feet. After the Polish Defense Ministry announced an unprecedented 33-day exercise in March next year, and the military began to hand out summonses (local media immediately shared their information that this was a hidden form of mobilization before Poland's entry into the conflict with Russia on the side of Kiev and the ""liberation campaign"" to Lviv and even further), Polish men suddenly felt such nostalgia for other EU countries.  That more than 70 thousand of them crossed the border of Poland in the direction of Germany, France, Portugal, etc. According to Polish newspapers, by March the number of such ""Ukrainian patriots"" among Polish men may already be several hundred thousand people. And therefore, more and more often there are voices about sending Ukrainians from among the refugees to the war instead of the Poles. In addition, the newspapers leaked information about about 1700 Polish mercenaries, whom Ukraine returned to Poland in a condition suitable only for burial. The Poles themselves clearly do not really want to fight with Russia in Ukraine. But will they be asked? However, this will clearly not add to the sympathy of the local population to Ukrainians and Ukraine. LISTEN AS WELL. How has 2022 changed the global economy?"

Or so: we are reaching the maximum scale of the special operation. - And Kyiv. - Ukraine is also coming out. Now everything that can be involved on their part is involved. There are no Western tanks yet, but a month or two – and they will appear. We are also dramatically increasing opportunities. During the winter campaign in the next month and a half, a lot will be determined. - A lot is what. - At least the further course of the conflict for the next five to six months. - Possible conflict with Poland. - Poland has an interest in getting as much gesheft as possible from this conflict. But Warsaw, plunging into the conflict at the level of its ""volunteers"", ""vacationers"", who are sitting there in Polish tanks, understands how important it is to choose the right point of intervention. - And if you intervene incorrectly. - That could end very badly. Rather, in the first half of the coming military campaign, Poland's tacit involvement in this conflict will continue. There will be more mercenaries, PMCs, instructors, people without documents. But so that Poland directly went to war with Russia with its brigades - so far this will not happen. - Russia may consider a mass supply of mercenaries and weapons by one of the NATO countries to be a sufficient reason. - We definitely don't need it now. We need to deal with Ukraine on Ukrainian territory. We understand the pros and cons of the fact that NATO countries do not officially get involved in the conflict. Their help to Ukraine is not infinite. This assistance does not help Ukraine to break the conflict. - And what helps. - It just supports its combat capabilities. On the other hand, we are satisfied that we are not opening a few more fronts. Because then we will also have to help defend Belarus. This problem will be for on. - A Ukrainian rocket crashes in Belarus. Minsk will be more actively involved in this conflict in 2023. -Unlikely. Belarus is not psychologically ready to enter this conflict. I don't think she'll be willing. For us, Belarus is more important in its current state, as a place where we can deploy our groups. Where we can place orders in factories, use industry. To use Belarus as a kind of point through which we have access to many things that we have under sanctions. It's much more important to us in this case now. - There is no direct threat to Belarus now. -No. For us, it is more important as a rear area, an area of concentration. From its territory, we can start hostilities. This will even be logical, especially if we step towards Western Ukraine and cut it off, cutting off all communications. - December 2023. The way you see it. - The optimistic forecast is that by next December the conflict will end with Ukraine being forced to fall out of the conflict on the terms that we will dictate. Will we be able to occupy it all? I don't really know it yet. - And what needs to happen so that we can dictate the terms. To do this, we must completely isolate Central and Eastern Ukraine from communication with the West. Cut down the corridors that are now there. In this case, occupy Western Ukraine and plug this traffic jam. We must defeat the main military groups that we now have. That is, to deprive Ukraine of the opportunity to conduct any offensive actions. To jeopardize the main political centers. Kiev must then choose between an honorable surrender or an assault. - A pessimistic scenario. - If a lot of things don't work out, then most likely in December we will have the same conversations about how the SVO will go further. - Kadyrov announced the second stage of Operation Retaliation in Ukraine. What's going to come out of it. - I don't really understand what kind of operation you're talking about. It seemed to me that this was more of a local operation related to the actions of Chechen units. I haven't heard of Operation Retaliation at the level of the entire faction. The first was Operation Retaliation for the deaths in Kiev of several dozen Chechens killed by the Nazis. If I'm not mistaken. - How can a positive forecast be justified? Ukrainians have an unlimited reserve. - ""Unlimited reserve"" - it is very much limited. A third of Ukraine left. The entire mobilization resource of Ukraine is in the region of 1.5-2 million. Of these, as they themselves say, a million are already under arms. This million is not fighting in its entirety. The combat core works - it is about 600-700 thousand. The number of heavy weapons they have in short supply. They take advantage of what they have given. Ukraine does not have its own military-industrial complex. - And further. - If we can impose our own line of conflict on the conduct of hostilities, namely, we will not limit ourselves only to the conflict in the Donbass, but create two or three more operational directions, two more fronts, then Ukraine will begin to experience very serious problems with its ability to bring the conflict into a normal course for it.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700672/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-29,Will NATO be able to openly intervene in the conflict? It is revealed why Ukraine staged a provocation with missiles in Belarus,Political analyst Vadim Gigin: Ukraine's missile strike is an attempt to assassinate the territory of Belarus,"The incident with the Ukrainian missile, which was shot down over the Belarusian territory, is quite natural, given kiev's aggressive rhetoric against Belarus. This opinion was expressed on the air of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" by the Belarusian political scientist, Chairman of the Board of the Belarusian Society ""Knowledge"" Vadim Gigin. ""This is certainly an egregious case,"" he said. - And in reality, it does not matter much whether it is an accident or a deliberate provocation. Because on the part of the Kiev regime, we have recently heard aggressive rhetoric, which is on the rise. Near the Belarusian border, a large group of troops controlled by Kiev is concentrated, including missile launchers deployed. This is not the first time we have shot down Ukrainian missiles. We remember the cases with Tochka-U and with unmanned aerial vehicles that were destroyed by the Belarusian air defense. Kiev openly talks about the goals that are considered on the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there is an illegal armed formation formed from Belarusian citizens who fled to the territory of Ukraine. According to Vadim Gigin, Kiev's aggressive rhetoric against Belarus took place even before February 24 of this year. Various neo-Nazi and extremist groups found refuge in Ukraine, set up camps and training centers there. ""It is not so much the reason that happened on December 29 that is important, but the possible response to such a provocation,"" the Belarusian expert continues. ""The coordinated actions of the air defense system, border guards, the endurance shown by our fighters on the border - all this can deter the Kiev regime from further provocative actions. But we must understand that no one is protected from such ""accidental"" incidents in quotation marks. Because there are troops at the border, these troops are on the platoon, they are constantly being stirred up by nationalist, Nazi propaganda. We see and hear it all the time. Our border guards tell how the Theroboronians on the other side go to the border, point weapons in our direction. In such an environment, serious incidents can continue to occur. But the tough and rapid rebuff from all national security systems shows our readiness, if necessary, to repel such attempts on the territory of Belarus. But still, I would like, and this is the most important thing, to prevent them at an early stage. Why does Ukraine arrange such provocations? There are several versions. And each of them is worse than the other. First. Kiev was simply probing the limits of what is permissible. How far and how hard you can hit so you don't get back. So far, Alexander Lukashenko has not spoken out on this matter. But without a doubt, the answer will be - we know the father. In the meantime, Kiev is trying in every possible way to ""hush up"" this incident. And he vows to ""conduct a big investigation"" and punish all those responsible. Second version. Belarus is the ""entry point"" for NATO into the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Ukraine, or rather its foreign masters, provoke Minsk to retaliate in order to draw it into hostilities. And under this pretext, they may try to achieve direct NATO intervention in the conflict. So a lot now depends on the decision of Alexander Lukashenko. LISTEN AS WELL.

So far, from their words, the working version looks like this. The flight of the S-300 missile from the territory of Ukraine was recorded at about 10-30 am. Apparently, the wreckage of the rocket fell in the Ivanovo district of the Brest region (near the agro-town of Gorbakh). The wreckage has already established the type and ""brand"" of the missile - this is the product 5B55R of the S-300PS complex. Here are her ""passport details"". Weight, kg: 166. Length, m: 7,2. Diameter, m: 0.50. Warhead weight, kg: 13. Control: radio command (there is a homing head). It has already been established with a high degree of probability that the rocket will be launched. The 540th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (this unit, which is stationed in the village of Kamianka-Bugska, Lviv region, is armed with S-300PS missiles). The regiment took up combat duty relatively recently - on January 14 of this year, but had already managed to ""distinguish"" itself when it had recently ""smeared"" the same missile in Poland, knocking out a tractor and hitting two civilians. The Belarusian military agree that Ukrainian inept people tried to counteract the massive Russian missile raid on Thursday, but again ""messed something up."" By the way, the 540th regiment covers Lviv, and our Kalibr hit its military-industrial facilities. Well, from Lviv to the Ivanovo district in the Brest region is about 250 kilometers. For a rocket that flies at a speed of 1800 meters per second, such a ""misfire"" is a trifle. The Ministry of Defense reported that the Ukrainian S-300 missile was shot down by the air defense of Belarus."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700650/,Dmitry STESHIN,2022-12-30,How and when the special operation in Ukraine will end: military commander Steshin gave an honest answer,Voenkor Dmitry Steshin suggested that Russia's special operation in Ukraine will end by the autumn of 2023,"- Let's find the starting point. At what point did you realize that a military special operation was inevitable. - Something struck me when the incessant exercises of our troops began in the borderlands. On the night the SVO started, my boss called me at 5 a.m. and said, ""Are you asleep? It's begun."" And I slept already in the space of our battalion on two-story bunks. It became clear that now we will move somewhere. Everything was ready, the columns were formed, I received a number for my car - and rushed. - At what point did you realize that unpleasant times await us ahead. - Sometime in July. - Only six months later. - All this time I was in Mariupol, where we won, took prisoners by the thousands. Why should we in this local sector of the front think that everything went wrong somehow? A person in war has a little tunnel vision, he sees only what is in front of him. And then everything stalled. But I was struck by one detail. I went to helicopter pilots in Valuiki, Belgorod Region. I flew with them to storm the fortifications near the village of Prishib. And I was amazed at how empty the roads in the Kharkiv region are. There was no usual movement of military equipment, troops. Operational emptiness. There were very few of us for the new format of the special operation. - What's wrong with the format. - We conducted a rapid police operation against a country that waged an all-out war against us. - You assumed that NATO would be tense. -Yes. Ukraine is porcelain hares, on which the West trains to fight with Russia. And how we will appear in this special operation, how we will finish it, it will depend on whether there will be a second series. There are analogies in history - the Finnish war. - Tell me, you have a specific answer to the question of why the West is really so harnessed to Ukraine. - Because the West realized that an alternative center of power began to take shape in the world. And in terms of the population in this center of power, the volume of industry, the West somehow loses a little, and the consequences can be unpredictable. Russia did not hide the fact that it was one of the initiators of the creation of a bipolar world, some kind of alliances of large states alternative to the West. Plus we're hated just for being there. Too big and independent. - You have drawn parallels with the Great Patriotic War many times. You can compare. - I began to compare it from 2014, lying in Slavyansk in a hotel called ""Ukraine"", in a house made of body armor. My grandmother just vacated these places, and I thought then: it's good that she did not live, did not see this. Against us are the same banners and symbols, the same ideology - the strange superiority of one half-uterine nation over another. - What kind of nation is this. - They are called ""political Ukrainians"". They may not know movy, have completely Russian surnames, but they are ready to shed their own blood for Ukrainianness and as much as they want - children's, women's. Recently, one of the developers of the game S.T.A.L.K.E.R., by the name of Yezhov, died. A good such ""Ukrainian"" surname. I met with him in 2006 in the Chernobyl zone, we had a heartfelt conversation then. They wrote to me that already in 2014 he called for ""killing rusnya"" and volunteered. I think now he would kill me without thinking. - A natural question arises: how long, in your opinion, all this will drag on and how you see the ending. - I assume that it will end by the autumn of next year and the end of the SVO will be military-political. There is no purely military solution, and there is no purely political solution either. - We will drive tanks into Khreshchatyk. - At least. All Russian-speaking areas inhabited by people who speak Russian should become liberated territories by Russia. In other areas, I will not be surprised at all if Ivano-Frankivsk suddenly votes in a referendum for joining the Russian Federation. They are very practical people - Ukrainians. - Wait, this is the western part of Ukraine. - Yes, but I wouldn't be surprised if they want to be forgiven and be with the Russian Federation. And you know what's encouraging? In 2013, when the Maidan began to unwind, a poll was held. The questionnaires were all in two copies - on the move and on the Russian. So, even in the most desperately Western regions, people took questionnaires in Russian language. 80 - 90 percent. 83% in Ivano-Frankivsk region. Of course, the situation has changed, but Russian culture, the Russian language will not be shaken off in a few years and will not be abandoned. LISTEN AS WELL.

Rostislav Shurma, deputy head of Zelensky's office, announced the possibility of a new tax on the financing of the army. He recalled that now all military expenditures of the budget are financed exclusively by taxpayers. According to the official, the country's authorities decided to consider the introduction of a specific tax on the armed forces. Since 2014, all individuals in Ukraine have been paying a military fee of 1.5% of their salaries. In the summer of 2022, military personnel were released from its payment. Waiting for everyone else to be released is hardly more than a year away. Mikhail Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation of the independent country, said that ""on his knees"" he asked Musk to launch the Starlink satellite communication system on independent lands. Fedorov in an interview with the AP agency admitted that he ""knelt, begging the head of SpaceX to start work in Ukraine."" The official was afraid that Ukraine would ""set a world record."" And he swore that the transfer of Starlink terminals to Kiev ""will save thousands of lives."" In total, about 24 thousand terminals were transferred. But a prisoner of war from the 113th Territorial Defense Brigade, Sergei Lazarenko, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine use this system not only for military purposes, but also for personal calls and for chatter in social networks.

Sergei Lavrov, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview with RIA Novosti said that by putting forward ""formulas for peace"", Zelensky cherishes the illusion of achieving with the help of the West the withdrawal of our troops from the Russian territory of Donbass, Crimea, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, payment of reparations by Russia and appearance ""with guilt in international tribunals."" Our minister said: ""Of course, we will not talk to anyone on such terms."" And recalled: ""Already in April, at the behest of the Anglo-Saxons, interested in continuing hostilities, Zelensky quickly stopped negotiations and sharply toughened his position."" And really, what to talk about with banderlogs. The air raid alarm sounded in Kiev and 12 regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Kiev-controlled areas of the two south-eastern regions. The alarm was announced in Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions of Ukraine. A series of powerful explosions were noted by local authorities on the territory of the hero-city of Odessa, as well as in Zhytomyr. Similar reports came from Kiev ( including from its mayor). The monument to the great commander Alexander Suvorov was dismantled in Odessa last night. This was reported by the online publication ""Dumskaya"" with reference to the city council of Odessa. This demolition took place after the dismantling of the monument to Catherine II.On November 30, Odessa deputies voted to dismantle the sculptures of these two historical characters of world magnitude. It is significant that the monument to Catherine the Great and the founders of the city was erected in 1900, and the previous time it was dismantled in 1920 by the Bolsheviks, who created modern Ukraine, and returned to its former place ... In 2007, the monument in honor of the Empress, on whose orders Odessa was founded in 1794, was repeatedly attacked by vandals. The last vandals were local people's representatives. The people choose the rulers they deserve. The hacker group RaHDit, which can be translated as ""Evil Russian hackers"", published a list of hundreds of people. It includes NATO career military personnel and persons providing services to cyber centers in the Baltic States and Ukraine. One of the hackers said: ""It is NATO centers that are behind cyber attacks, while the cadre Ukrainian security forces and people's activists perform only the role of a cover."" The full list of persons and the data on them are published on the portal of the project ""Nemesis"" in the section ""Foreign accomplices and mercenaries"". The uncovered specialists are indicated in the section as ""NATO Cyber Troops"". No one will leave unrecognized. T-80 BV tanks, one of the best in the world, arrived in the Zaporozhye direction to participate in the SVO. One of the crew members assessed the combat capabilities of this armored vehicle: ""This machine is three or four times superior to enemy vehicles. More maneuverable, faster-firing, on the ground, off-road accelerates quickly to 80 kilometers per hour. In an oncoming tank battle, the enemy has no chance."" The T-80 has a gas turbine propulsion system, and it is the world's first tank with built-in anti-shell dynamic protection. The commander of the Espanyol unit with the call sign ""Spaniard"" said that the number of people wishing to serve in this fan unit at the Vostok Brigade, which performs combat missions of the SVO Donbass, exceeded his ability to accept volunteers. He said, ""We don't have any seats anymore. And there are a few hundred more people who want to. We could make a huge unit.""

The beginning of the CVO was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling the main goals of the special military operation the protection of Donbass civilians from genocide by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on December 29, 2022. Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his message to the Verkhovna Rada publicly called the main goal of Ukraine in the conflict with Russia the restoration of the territorial integrity of the country. The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) struck at Donetsk from a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS). This was announced by the mayor of Donetsk Alexei Kulemzin in his Telegram channel, specifying that 16 shells were fired. The United States through diplomatic channels stated that it does not want and does not plan to directly fight with Russia, and also does not intend to send its military specialists to Ukraine in connection with the transfer of Patriot air defense systems to Kiev. This was announced by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov."

The governor of the region, Roman Busargin, wrote in his telegram channel that they shot down a drone, fragments from which damaged a car, a garage and a fence of a private house, and also broke a window on the balcony. According to the head of the region, there were no victims, the evacuation of children's institutions was not carried out. In Mikhail Antonov's program on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda, we discussed the problem of long-range Ukrainian drones, which are not the first time they reach the Volga city, where serious combat aviation of the Russian Air Force is based, with the military observer of TASS, retired Colonel Viktor Litovkin. - And what's up there again. - It seems that the Strizh drone is still of Soviet production. The Ukrainian Banderites, it seems, have already ""shot"" at the airfield in Engels. - It was a scout or he was walking with ammunition. - Most likely, it was a reconnaissance aircraft, converted into a cruise missile. Initially, it was a reconnaissance aircraft that should fly with a radius of up to a thousand kilometers, photograph the target and return back, dropping cassettes with photographic film. But here we see that the Ukrainians, with the help of their curators, were able to convert these jet UAVs into attack drones. - And such a drone can be controlled remotely. - It's not manageable. It lays down the program of flight and return. He had to get to Engels by ""autopilot"". But there was knocked out by our air defense. - But why didn't the air defenses land it earlier. - We do not have an air defense system at every step. It is not surprising that it can pass through areas where there are no continuous barriers from the air defense system. Of course, there is a similar thing around large cities, defense, economic facilities and at the front. For example, the same Strizh drone Tu-141 flew to Croatia this spring, and flew there through NATO countries. And no one not only did not notice him, but also did not shoot him down. There is nothing surprising in this. And there is nothing to reproach our military for. - Maybe it's time for us to lift airships. - You can raise it - but what's the point? Well, they will detect the flight of the drone, and then. In Kharkiv, more than a hundred such drones were produced at the aircraft factory. If we have not yet discovered the Ukrainian warehouse where these UAVs are located, if we have not destroyed this aircraft plant yet, they will probably continue to arrive. - The Swifts have arrived, and where have the Bayraktars gone. - So they don't fly that far! At 150 kilometers maximum. ""Strizh"" is a long-range product of the Soviet model. Turkish ""Bayraktars"" can not fly from Ukraine to any Engels. And ""Pantsir-S"" deals with ""Bayraktars"" for once. Only it is necessary to carry out enhanced combat duty. READ ALSO. In Ukraine, Soviet drones are being re-equipped with American navigation systems for strikes on Russia.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4700653/,Valentin ALFIMOV,2022-12-29,"What will happen after the fall of the Ukrainian missile in Belarus: ""There is a plan""",Political analyst Koshkin believes that the fall of the Ukrainian missile in Belarus was a provocation,"CUNNING RASCHE. The arrival of the Ukrainian missile in Belarus is not an accident, says Andrei Koshkin, an expert at the Association of Military Political Scientists. In his opinion, this is a well-thought-out and finely planned operation. - I think this is a provocation. They can probe how deep and far it is possible to shell Belarus,"" Koshkin said on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda. - Moreover, the same ""already experienced"" anti-aircraft missile regiment that conducted the operation in Poland was working. I think that they were tasked with conducting the same provocation on the territory of Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko has not yet made any official statements, while investigators and specialists of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense are working at the scene on his instructions. But it is obvious that the answer from the father will be. And a lot depends on what it will be, the expert believes. - Then in November, the United States stood up for the Ukrainians. I don't think they're going to intercede here again to hush up the incident. We are waiting for what Lukashenka will say. Because for him this is a test, he needs to clearly show his position. He's talked about toughness many times. We will see what the response will be and what measures will be taken to deal with this fall. I DON'T CHANGE MY PLANS. But Kiev and its curators will not be able to provoke Russia and draw it into this whirlpool through Belarus. We have a strategic partnership plan. And this provocation perfectly reinforces it, says Dmitry Solonnikov, director of the Institute of Modern State Development, political scientist. - There will be training of Belarusian pilots, there will be joint coordination of combat groups, a joint grouping will be strengthened on the border of the European Union and Belarus, Belarus and Ukraine. But now there will be no extraordinary action. This is a provocation. A rocket fell and suddenly something quickly began to be done. Everything will be according to plan. Nor will there be emergency arms supplies to Minsk from Moscow, exposing its rear. Even though the provocation was committed against a member of the Union State. - There is a plan for the rearmament of Belarus, there is a plan for training pilots who will fly aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Iskanders and S-400s are being transferred to Belarus,"" Solonnikov said. - These plans exist, just this arrival once again confirms that they need to be implemented. That's another additional argument, if you will. Kiev confirmed to us today that we are right and we need to follow this course. - Because today the Ukrainian regime is a handshake regime that is fully blessed with all actions by the United States. And should be blessed with Europe as well. Europe has nothing to say against those supported by the US. THE PENTAGON SAYS WHERE THE BIT IS. Why does Ukraine have so many S-300 air defense systems? After all, it was the air defense points that were the first targets at the very beginning of the special operation? It turns out that this is an echo of the USSR. - Ukraine had the most powerful air defense system in the Soviet Union after Russia. There were at least 30 anti-aircraft missile regiments of S-300 alone,"" explains Vladislav Shurygin, a military expert and member of the Izborsk Club. Yes, since February, Russian troops have noticeably thinned out the order of battle, now Kiev is forced to beg for systems from the West, because there are fewer and fewer of its own. And as they are eliminated, Ukraine's combat capabilities, ability to detect, and, importantly, combat skill fall. ""All of Ukraine's air defense is now based on American information,"" Shurygin said. - They receive information from radars on American Awakes aircraft. This information is directly transmitted to the Ukrainian command, and they are already sent to the divisions. There can be both glitches and errors within this transmission. Therefore, the results are as follows. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE UKRAINIAN WHINING. Meanwhile, the deficit of combat calculations is confirmed even by the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine Budanov. He said that ""Ukraine is not able to achieve significant success in the conflict with Russia, the Ukrainian army does not have enough resources to advance."" Kiev is once again looking forward to new arms shipments. - I would trust any statements of Budanov with about zero percent, - vladislav Shurygin notes. - I would very much like to convince myself that Ukraine no longer has any strength to fight. But I am well aware that both the army command and the intelligence are doing everything to misinform us. The expert compares these statements with recent stories about the fact that Kharkiv is defended by old Theroboronovtsy and Divchins at checkpoints. In fact, this is not true in any way. ""I think Ukraine has the strength to try to attack,"" Shurygin said. At the same time, he agrees, Kiev is no longer able to change the situation strategically, but they can strike and advance in places, sometimes even pretend to be victories. - We shouldn't relax in this case. They can be active for a while. And I think it's not one month or two. The conflict has just entered the stage of maximum tension. I think the outcome of the winter campaign will be decided in January. And it's going to have a very big impact for the next three to five months. If this campaign is unsuccessful for Ukraine, we will have the prospect that by the middle or end of next year Ukraine will find itself in a very difficult, catastrophic situation. If they can hold on and even inflict some defeats on us, then this campaign will drag on even more."

According to a report by the Royal Joint Institute for Defense Studies, 90% of the drones that Ukraine managed to accumulate before the start of the SVO were shot down or damaged by the summer of 2022, which forced Ukraine to request these types of weapons from the United States and NATO. At the same time, according to statistics, an ordinary drone is shot down already on the third or fourth flight, and large models similar to airplanes - on the sixth or seventh. The author of the article notes that russian electronic warfare troops nullified the intelligence advantages of Ukraine, thanks to which the Armed Forces of Ukraine could strike at Russian troops with much smaller artillery forces. According to the journalist, serious losses of drones deprived the Armed Forces of Ukraine of advantages and increased the survival rate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, allowing for a more active offensive. According to experts, soon the Ukrainian military will be forced to ""beat blindly"", and, therefore, will increase the consumption of ammunition. So, perhaps, the independent country will soon have a ""shell famine"". The remnants of Ukrainian aviation also suffer from electronic warfare. It was the pilots who first felt the problems from the interference, because of which the missiles hit inaccurately, and the navigation systems literally ""went crazy"". Even the vaunted Bayraktars, according to the author of the article, were not good enough against the electronic warfare of domestic troops. Despite the image of the ""miracle weapon"", the real successes of the Turkish UAVs were possible only thanks to the confusion of the first months of the conflict and the unpreparedness of the Russian Armed Forces to resist. However, by the summer, bayraktars had learned to deal effectively, so at the moment most of them no longer fly in the sky, but lie on the ground as scrap metal. LISTEN AS WELL.

The first air raid alarms were recorded in Ukrainian cities around 9 a.m. In Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovograd, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Kharkiv, Odessa and other regions, residents were urged to go down to shelters. In Kryvyi Rih, the power supply was stopped preventively - due to the high probability of strikes. Just a few minutes later, reports of explosions began to arrive in Zhytomyr, Odessa, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. What weapons were used to strike was not reported, but according to Ukrainian media, many of the explosions were the result of the work of the Ukrainian air defense. The Armed Forces of Ukraine failed to intercept all Russian missiles: in Odessa and Dnepropetrovsk, electricity was cut off. According to the mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko, several explosions were recorded in the Ukrainian capital. According to Ukrainian media, the most tangible damage from the strikes was recorded in Kiev and Odessa. According to Ukrzaliznytsia (Ukrainian Railways), there are significant interruptions in the movement of trains in almost all directions. Perhaps it was the suspension of railway communication and the creation of difficulties for Ukraine in the supply of ammunition to the front line that was the main target of the strikes. By the way, arrivals were recorded not only in the central and eastern regions of Ukraine, but also in the West of the country. The mayor of the city Andriy Sadovyi reported about the explosions in Lviv, information is received about the ""arrivals"" in Ivano-Frankivsk.

On the ""Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" on the air of Maria Bachenina, political scientist Alexander Asafov commented on the new blows to the infrastructure of Ukraine. - What the new wave of blows means is a harbinger of the next stage of the SVO. - The Minister of Defense of Russia and other competent persons, including Surovikin, have repeatedly said why such strikes are carried out. It is necessary to disrupt the supply and provision of Ukrainian troops on the contact line. This is largely due to logistics directly aimed at supporting the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As well as control systems. Of course, we are also talking about energy infrastructure facilities. The tactics of bleeding the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the front line are directly related to pinpoint strikes on logistics and energy links. Each such strike means thousands of shells not delivered to Ukrainian units and dozens of armored vehicles and artillery installations that did not reach the front. - There is a plan of strikes by days, by weeks - or still by the situation they are shelled. - In my opinion, the reduction of critical infrastructure of Ukraine is going according to plan. Moreover, we are talking mainly about objects mainly not of a double, but of a military-oriented orientation. It is strategically important to limit Kiev's ability to repair failed equipment and produce new ones. And also to supply it with fuel. Therefore, they hit fuel storage facilities and warehouses, repair plants. All this fits into one of the stated goals of the CBO. On the demilitarization of Ukraine. - Do we want to destroy this infrastructure completely? And is it even possible. - It's hard for me to make that assessment. I am not an expert in military strategy and tactics. But, I believe, this is a story not in the direction of totality, but in the direction of achieving goals for individual regions, for individual plants of the military-industrial complex. Strikes are carried out, their consequences are analyzed, the subsequent state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is assessed, and the next strikes are planned. There is probably no goal of 100 percent destruction. What we are trying to convey should reach the Kiev regime. We reduce the risks for our servicemen by minimizing the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, the media discusses more power plants and generators, and I would pay attention to the destruction of military facilities used for the repair, production and storage of weapons intended for the front line.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701231/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-29,"Changing ""Poplar"" to ""Yarsy""",The Russian Missile Forces are rapidly re-equipping with the latest systems capable of overcoming any missile defense.,"A column of military equipment is slowly being pulled into the turns on a narrow forest highway. In front is a traffic police car, in the center - a truck-loader of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ""Yars"" resembling a huge truck. It is forbidden to go faster than 20 km / h by the standards: the transportation of this rocket and its installation in the mine is a slow and accurate work. This time, the Yars is being taken to the Kozelsk Division of the Rocket Forces in the Kaluga Region. This is just one of the stages of a large-scale rearmament of the Strategic Missile Forces. Where the Topol-M that had already served used to stand, now the Yars are settling in. These ICBMs are also mobile, on wheels. They are able to suddenly appear where the enemy is not waiting. However, near Kozelsk, the Yarsy will stand in silos, and rocket scientists will have a jeweler's operation to put this colossus in its regular place. Yars stands for ""Nuclear Deterrent Missile"". With a flight range of about 12 thousand kilometers, its deviation from the target is only 150 meters. For a nuclear explosion, it's just ridiculous. No wonder Western military and analysts were horrified by the capabilities of the Yars. But that's not all. Among other things, the designers were tasked with guaranteed overcoming of enemy missile defenses. Managed! Approaching the target, ""Yars"" throws away guided warheads, which from that moment move along an unpredictable trajectory. They can't be shot down. The United States has invested huge amounts of money in missile defense, including in Europe. And now what's the point. Europe and the British Isles, by the way, were the most agitated. This is understandable: the west of the continent for the ""Yars"" is in the palm of your hand. Reports on the rearmament of the Kozel division were perceived by many there as a signal: we, that is, Russia, will reach out to you in any case. And this is not bravado: in October of this year, yars, launched from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region, safely hit a target in Kamchatka. London and Berlin are much closer. The United States was not pleased with the new weapons of the Strategic Missile Forces either. After all, the American strategic forces have not been updated for many years. In fact, since the early 90s, when Americans considered themselves winners in the Cold War. The only thing they did was upgrade their Minuteman rockets, which were hopelessly outdated. Washington is well aware that they are decades behind Russia. And not only for the Yars (for other new strategic missile defense systems, see the ""By the way"" section on this page). However, for the American administration, the main thing is to seem, not to be. Therefore, Washington is trying in every possible way to make a good mine with a disgusting game. Slowly, buzzing with engines, the shaft lid opens. This is a whole protective device that can withstand the hit of high-precision weapons. Loading the rocket takes several hours: you need to install a multi-ton cylinder exactly in the center, and then lower millimeter by millimeter to the depth of a 10-storey building. Kozel rocket scientists will have such an operation more than once: as reported in the Ministry of Defense, this unit was the first to be completely re-equipped with ""Yarsy"" stationary, that is, silo-based. ""We have been retrained at the Yars complex,"" says Lieutenant Colonel Artem Ignatiev, commander of one of the divisions of the Kozelsky formation. - Compared to the previous one, it is much more modern. Before taking up duty, we undergo psychological selection. The commander of the regiment allows us to work, we work out the standards, introductory, solve training tasks. Rearmament is in full swing. While one missile is loaded into the silo at the speed of a snail, the other is already preparing to stand on combat duty. Within a few weeks, officers will begin to keep watch deep underground, from where they are guaranteed to be able to strike back in the event of an attack. ""Another combat missile is on duty at scheduled times,"" the commander of the missile division, Alexei Sokolov, said after the operation. - The Motherland will receive another sample of nuclear missile weapons, which will allow solving any important tasks at the strategic level. OUR REFERENCE. According to some reports, the Strategic Missile Forces are already armed with more than 150 Yars launchers of mobile and silo-based systems. ""Wheeled"" ""Yars"" is equipped with a system for recalculating the flight task. Thanks to this, the missile can be launched from any point of the combat patrol route. To increase the protection of the complex, a false division with inflatable mock-ups and engine simulators was included in its composition. Thus, it is difficult for the enemy to determine where the false target is, and where the real complex is. ""Yars"" carries 4 warheads with a total charge capacity of up to 500 kilotons. The rocket has 3 stages. Its length is 17.8 meters, diameter - 1.86 m. Launch mass - 46 tons, payload weight - 1250 kg. KSTAT. ""Sarmat"", arriving from the south. Yars missiles are not the only innovation in the range of weapons of Russian rocket scientists-strategists. In the Orenburg region, the 13th Yasnensky Division is being re-equipped with the newest strategic silo-based complex ""Avangard"". The warheads of these missiles are capable of gliding at an altitude of several tens of kilometers along an unpredictable trajectory and at hypersonic speed. But the biggest ""gift"" to Russia's enemies is the newest Sarmat missile system, it should soon go to the troops. The summer range of this heavy missile is 18 thousand kilometers, this allows it to reach the territory of the United States through the South Pole. That is, to fly from the south, from Miami, where the Americans have no missile defense at all (the US missile defense system has always been sharpened for a strike through the North Pole). But even if the Americans invest billions and supply missile defense systems in this direction, this will not help: against the Sarmata hypersonic warheads, which are rushing in a cloud of plasma along an unpredictable trajectory, the United States does not yet have an antidote."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701230/,Marina SMIRNOVA,2022-12-29,Khartsyzsk Pipe Plant supplies products to Russian customers,The enterprise for the production of pipes in Khartsyzsk in the north of the DPR is one of the oldest in the Donbass,"Built at the beginning of the last century, under the USSR, it was one of the main suppliers of pipes for gas pipelines in the Union. The aggression of the Armed Forces of Ukraine against Donbass stopped the plant, but now it is restarted. Today, about 500 people already work in production. Due to the fact that Donbass has become part of Russia, Khartsyzsk Pipe Plant ships its products to customers in almost all parts of Russia. And the plans are to develop the geography of implementation. Through the pipes welded at this enterprise of Donbass, gas was pumped for almost 40 years - they are made according to the highest quality standards. In particular, they are installed on the Urengoy - Pomary - Uzhgorod, Yamal - Europe gas pipeline. The Khartsyzsk plant began as a manufacturer of metal structures for mines and bridges, trolleys, steel rafters, etc. Before the First World War, it introduced the production of pipes - even without the use of electric welding. The plant grew and developed in Soviet times. When Donbass was occupied by the Germans during the Great Patriotic War, the Nazis destroyed the enterprise to the ground. After the liberation of the territory by the Red Army, a pile of ruins appeared before the arriving engineers. Years passed, the plant was restored, and then its accelerated growth began: the USSR became one of the world's leading exporters. Then the company established the production of special, especially durable, corrosion-proof pipes for gas pipelines, which provided it with fame for decades. After the collapse of the USSR, under the ""independent"" Ukrainian government, the plant fell into decay, for its actions there was a fierce struggle of various Ukrainian business structures, employees were dismissed. Of the 21 workshops, only six remained (two main ones for the production of pipes and four auxiliary ones), the rest were put into scrap metal. In 2014, Khartsyzsk Pipe was part of the business empire of Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Ukraine's aggression against Donbass in 2014 raised the question of the plant's existence. Now the plant is coming to life. Albeit with inevitable problems, but it works. And most importantly, now he has prospects and customers from almost all over Russia."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701229/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-31,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 31, 2022: Arestovich revealed the terrible truth, and Kavasniewski gave a catastrophic forecast","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on December 31, 2022","Border waters are no longer guarded by one side. Taras Melnychuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers in the Rada, said that Kiev had terminated the agreement with Moscow on the joint use and protection of border water bodies. It operated for 30 years, since October 1992. Yes, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the regime to protect the banks of the Dnieper. And what will happen to the banks of the Danube... That's why the hell with him, with the agreement. Real Cossacks make their feet out of themselves. 12,000 true patriots of the independent country tried to wash away from their purely European country because of martial law and possible conscription into the army. Such data was provided by the State Border Guard Service itself. Of the fugitives, at least 15 died in the river and in the mountains. Some even tried to swim to... Romania (clearly not read The Golden Calf). It would be better to lay down their troubled heads for their homeland somewhere in the Donbass, or they came out with a white flag. Their losses at the Kremennaya Armed Forces of Ukraine are explained by bad weather. Andriy Marochko, an officer of the LPR People's Militia, said that Ukrainian officers explain the bad weather to their command large losses near Kremennaya and Svatovo. According to intelligence reports, officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complain that due to weather conditions it is not possible to conduct reconnaissance of the area with the help of drones. And because of the weather, offensive actions slow down, and Ukrainian soldiers become an easy target. The other day, even the sixth president recognized the high dangers for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, the situation in Donbass is difficult and painful. But it is gradually becoming the same to the west of the Seversky Donets. In the LPR, a gunner of the Ukrainian artillery was detained. In the LPR, representatives of the Russian special services detained a resident of the liberated Svatovo. The lady is suspected of passing on to the Ukrainian special services data on the movement of military and equipment of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. There is information that the Armed Forces of Ukraine could use the data transmitted by the attacker, including for artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure facilities in Svatovo. Earlier, FSB officers detained a native of the Kherson region, who transmitted information about the location of Russian troops to representatives of the SBU. The waiters waited so hard for ""their own"" that they waited for the catalage. The Ukrainian conflict is approaching the third world war, Kwasniewski believes. Aleksander Kwasniewski, Poland's former president, said the planet was in a state of ""unsafe chaos."" The former leader of Poland said: ""Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the world has changed dramatically. One era is over and a new, unexplored era has begun."" According to him, other elements of the destruction of the world order were the election of Biden as US President and the exacerbated contradictions between the PRC and Taiwan. Kwasniewski suggested that both the ""Ukrainian"" and ""Chinese"" conflicts could escalate into global ones. It is significant that earlier US President Joe Biden after a meeting with Zelensky said that the West, including the United States, does not seek a war with Russia, as well as a third world war, supplying weapons to Ukraine. And what they are then striving for is the endless enrichment of their military-industrial complex. Will Kiev be saved by a thousand British metal detectors? London handed over to Kiev more than a thousand VALLON metal detectors and 100 bomb disposal kits. A message on the website of the British Cabinet of Ministers indicates that mine countermeasures equipment will help the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""neutralize minefields"" and ""secure the homes of civilians and infrastructure."" The information, in particular, says: ""This is the last delivery within the framework of the support that Britain provides to Ukraine during 2022, and which will continue in 2023."" It is also indicated that London provided the independent with a significant package of air defense systems, including more than a thousand air defense systems and 125 anti-aircraft guns. And the Royal Air Force made more than 240 flights to Poland to deliver these cargoes further east. In 2022, the British trained 11,000 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and in 2023 they will train 9,000 more. Total military aid amounted to 2.3 billion pounds. And they want to give the same amount to Kiev next year. It's not beer that kills people, it's freebies that kill people. General Clark denies the common interests of Kiev and Washington. General Wesley Clark, the former head of NATO's Joint Forces in Europe, said that the interests of Washington and Kiev coincide not at all 100 percent. The discrepancies seem to be this: Ukraine wants the return of territories, and the United States – to stabilize the situation and reduce the risks of a confrontation between Russia and NATO. Clark spoke about this at an online conference organized by the USA-Ukraine Foundation. According to him, the States hope to preserve as much territory as possible for Ukraine without the beginning of the third world war. Clark believes that the White House strategy is similar to ""fueling a deadlock"", in the successful resolution of which no one believes, but continues to bend the old line. In his opinion, Washington ""bleeds Ukraine"" - the country loses its infrastructure, loses its industrial potential. And Russia, Clark noted, is changing the situation by building up defenses. The general makes an original conclusion: Washington should send Kiev artillery installations, MLRS and UAVs. Oh yeah, Clark, ay yes strategist. The Armed Forces of Ukraine admitted that their missiles fell near Brest. Yuri Ignat, a spokesman for the Air Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, admitted that the S-300 sam missile that fell on the territory of Belarus could be Ukrainian, (and there are other options - like Greek or Turkish?). According to Ignat, this was possible. And I remembered about the territories of other neighboring countries. Also, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced its readiness to conduct an ""objective investigation of the incident that occurred on December 29 in the sky over the territory of Belarus."" But Kiev is ready to invite to the investigation only experts from among the countries that do not support Russia. Yes, the whole world remembers well how Zelensky tried to ""sell"" the missiles of his S-300, who killed peasants in the Polish borderland and killed a tractor, for Russian weapons of retaliation. Warsaw did not give Kiev a kick, and Minsk. Arestovich admits heavy losses at Bakhmuto. The Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer such serious losses in the area of Artemivsk (in the Ukrainian version - Bakhmut) and Soledar that the adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Oleksiy Arestovich has to admit this. He declared with a sour mine: ""Traditionally, we have Bakhmut and Soledar. We are suffering serious losses..."" On the eve of this statement, the commander of the Akhmat special forces, Apty Alaudinov, said that the Ukrainian authorities are preparing for the surrender of Artemovsk, where the hottest point on the entire front line is now located. That is, when kiev comes out of the drug fog and looks to the east, they are horrified, declare the end of the world – and go back into the fog. Well, that's it. Russian electronic warfare agents suppress Ukrainian systems. Asia Times states that Russian electronic warfare (EW) is very effective in the fight against Armed Forces drones. Columnist Gabriel Onrad believes: ""Russia may already be gaining the upper hand over electronic warfare in Ukraine, disabling its drones and blinding its artillery."" He refers to information from the Royal United Institute for Defence Studies (RUSI) from Britain. According to them, Russian electronic warfare systems have already neutralized the vast majority of Armed Forces of Ukraine's drones. By the summer, the Russian Armed Forces had shot down up to 90 percent of Ukrainian drones. Because of this, Kiev hysterically requested drones from Western countries. And ukrainian artillery may soon begin to work ""blindly"" because of the inability to correct fire from the air. Judging by the shelling of Donetsk, they have long been blinded by hatred. LISTEN AS WELL. How has 2022 changed the global economy?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701228/,Nikita MAKARENKOV,2022-12-29,Innovations will be taken into account in the development of the prosthetic and orthopedic center,In the near future there will be a program for the development of the enterprise,"At a meeting of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a member of the Council, journalist Marina Akhmedova told the head of state about the Donetsk Republican Prosthetic and Orthopedic Center. In the conversation, she touched upon the problems of this institution related to the mobilization of specialists, and also asked to consider the issue of demobilization of prosthetists. - There were many good prosthetists in the Donetsk Orthopedic Center, but in March almost everyone was mobilized - only one remained, and he works now both day and night. There was a queue to it, a huge queue of civilians and military,"" Marina Akhmedova told the president. She noted that Ukraine regularly sprinkles petal mines on Donbas settlements, and peaceful people, including children, unfortunately, step on them, as a result of which they lose limbs - they need prostheses. Prostheses are also needed by the military. - On the front line, I constantly met people on prostheses. They are ready to return to the front line if they have prostheses, and they, of course, believe that they will bring victory, because they have experience and they have the spirit. Now their stumps have already healed, but there are no prostheses, - continues Marina Akhmedova. - Recently, one of the prosthetists came to the dismissal, he went to the orthopedic center in Donetsk and said that when his comrades-in-arms found out that he was a prosthetist, they shouted at him: what are you doing here, you are much more important to us in the rear. And this is so, because a normal prosthetist cannot be brought up in one year. A member of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights also told the president that before the meeting, she visited the military hospitals of Burdenko and Vishnevsky to see how their rehabilitation process was going. According to Akhmedova, the situation there is close to ideal, but in Donetsk the situation is different. ""For example, in Donetsk there is not even a rehabilitologist for walking, because he is also mobilized,"" Marina Akhmedova told Vladimir Putin. - We need to return the prosthetists - both civilians and the military are asking for this. And probably, we should think about what to do to ensure that we have our own components for creating prostheses. In his reply, the President of Russia noted that the issue of demobilization of some specialists, including prosthetist doctors, would certainly be considered. Vladimir Putin said that at a meeting with the mothers of the participants of the special operation, women raised issues of providing assistance to the injured, wounded and disabled children. ""Here, of course, it is necessary to establish not only prosthetics in a modern way - we have all the opportunities for this, we just need to timely, now this time has just come, to expand the capabilities of our relevant specialized enterprises and organizations and to establish this work,"" Vladimir Putin said. The President of the Russian Federation also said that in the very near future in the social block of the government it will be necessary to create a special center that will deal with this. - All this together should be implemented, and in the shortest possible time. We will definitely do this,"" Vladimir Putin said. A week later, Marina Akhmedova reported that First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey Kiriyenko arrived at the Donetsk Republican Prosthetic and Orthopedic Center, he inspected the production and talked with people. - As a result of his trip, there will be an instruction to urgently develop a program for the development of the center and create a whole cluster for the production of prostheses, where new technologies will be taken into account. Bionic prostheses will also be produced there,"" Akhmedova said. REFERENCE ""KP. Donetsk Republican Prosthetic and Orthopedic Center was founded in 1945. This institution is the only enterprise in the republic that specializes in the production of individual technical means of rehabilitation. Here, on a free basis, disabled people, disabled children and citizens of other categories are provided with the necessary types of prosthetic and orthopedic products, orthopedic shoes, shoes for prostheses, breast prostheses and other products. The products manufactured in the center meet modern requirements and take into account the individual characteristics of all those who need to be provided with rehabilitation facilities. The range of products, in accordance with medical recommendations, is designed for all age categories, different degrees of motor activity, different levels of amputation."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701226/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2022-12-29,"Meet Dad, s**t",Russian pilots near Artemovsk repeated the feat of Nikolai Gastello,"Confirmation that today's warriors are worthy of the glory of fathers and grandfathers comes every day. Talk about this did not make much sense before: it is enough to recall the heroes of Syria - special forces officer Alexander Prokhorenko, pilots Oleg Peshkov and Roman Filipov. Now, during a special military operation, the feat again becomes part of life. This is the connecting thread of generations: from Nikolai Gastello, who in June 1941 crashed down on the enemy's column with a burning plane, to Roman Filipov, who blew himself up in Syria shouting: ""This is for you guys!"". And now to the crew of the Su-24M bomber - commander Alexander Antonov and navigator Vladimir Nikishin. On December 2, they, like Gastello, sent a combat vehicle to the center of the armored column of the Ukrainian Nazis. ""Meet me, s**t, Daddy!"" were the last words on the radio. Alexander Antonov and Vladimir Nikishin were pilots from God. You meet such people sometimes, they will joke, and ""shila"", that is, the purest alcohol, will be offered to taste ... But at the helm they are transformed: an experienced eye instantly catches the readings of the devices, the movements are confident and clear, and in everything there is a willingness to give life, if necessary, here and now. Alexander Antonov graduated from the Barnaul School in 1995. He served in various units, but most recently resigned from the VKS from the post of deputy commander of the regiment for flight training. Vladimir Nikishin also resigned from the Armed Forces. Almost nothing is known about him. Like Antonov, he could not imagine himself without the sky and, having left the army, found himself in the aviation unit of the private military company Wagner. ""They were top-class professionals,"" a colleague of the pilots told reporters from the PMC. - They had a lot of experience even before they came to our company. Both the commander and the navigator perceived the beginning of the special operation as an opportunity to use their skills for the benefit of the country. Alexander Sergeevich explained: ""The Motherland called me in a dream."" There is a common journalistic cliché: ""Nothing foreshadowed that day..."" But December 2 just foreshadowed... Around Artemovsk, which Ukronazis call Bakhmut, fierce fighting has recently flared up. Control over this settlement means a lot: the roads to Kramatorsk and Slavyansk are opening. And in the future, to the complete liberation of the Donetsk Republic. That is why, not sparing people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine throws here all new units, both career military and ter defense. The slow but inexorable advance of Russian units poses a colossal threat here. And the Wagner guys are part of that threat. On December 2, the enemy attempted to break through just in the vicinity of the Wagner positions. And not just someone ran to the attack - in the area of one of the settlements near Artyomovsk, the Nazis managed to concentrate a powerful group of armored vehicles, which began to displace Russian troops. The commander of the assault squad on the front line requested air support. It was about 10 p.m., but Alexander Antonov and Vladimir Nikishin immediately headed for their bomber. Take-off - within a few minutes, the Wagnerians managed to find a column in the dark. But to hit it, you had to go a few kilometers beyond the contact line. Antonov and Nikishin did so without hesitation. But this time the enemy managed to detect the target: a missile fired from an anti-aircraft missile system hits the Su-24M. Could the pilots have ejected? I guess... But then they would not have carried the bombs to the enemy column, would have put the lives of comrades on the ground at risk. They chose a battering ram. That is, immortality. We don't know what happened in the cockpit of the bomber. ""Meet, s**t, Daddy!"" - colleagues say that to joke moments before the death is very even in the style of Commander Antonov. Within 5 seconds, the observers recorded a powerful explosion in the area of concentration of the enemy column. Antonov's crew was the second loss of the Wagner air unit during a special operation in Ukraine. The first was Major General Kanamat Botashev. He, too, went to war for patriotic reasons, even though he was already in his 60s. On May 22, 2 days after his 63rd birthday, the pilot was killed near Popasna when his plane was shot down. Botashev was awarded the title of Hero of Russia posthumously. Will Alexander Antonov and Vladimir Nikishin become Heroes of Russia? I think it's a must! After all, as a result of their heroic actions, the enemy's armored breakthrough was disrupted. This saved many lives of their comrades, they gave their lives ""for their friends"". This impressed even Ukrainians. On December 15, they returned to Russia with honors the bodies of heroic pilots Vladimir Nikishin and Alexander Antonov. The remains were accompanied by the rector of the Lisichansk Cathedral, Archpriest Andrei Pavlenko, who was rescued from captivity. He said that the officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine gave him two flags of Russia to cover the coffins upon arrival in his homeland."

Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""If you go to beat the enemy, multiply your troops, empty your posts, remove communications. Having beaten the enemy, renew according to the circumstances, but drive him to the point of crushing,"" taught Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And he also repeated: ""The uncut forest grows again."" DESTROYED AN ENEMY AMBUSH. Private Konstantin GOLUBE. ""During the march in the area of one of the settlements, a column of Russian troops, which included Private Konstantin Golubev, was shelled from mortar guns and small arms by a sabotage and reconnaissance group of nationalists. Russian servicemen began to repel the attack. Despite the incessant shelling from the enemy, acting as part of the combat vehicle crew, Private Konstantin Golubev, in carrying out the order for the fire defeat of enemy forces, destroyed 3 units of special enemy equipment, as well as 2 long-term enemy firing points. Thanks to the cohesive, coordinated and well-developed actions of the crew, in which Konstantin Golubev acted, the positions of the nationalists were suppressed, which made it possible to continue the movement of the column and arrive in a timely manner in the specified area. "" SNIPER-LIKE COVERED UP. Sergeant Jaslan BAZARJAPO. ""A group of Russian servicemen, which included Sergeant Zhalsan Bazarzhapov, carried out tasks to detect nationalist positions in a given area. Moving along the forest belt, Russian servicemen discovered an armed group of Ukrainian militants. A fight ensued. Zhalsan was one of the first to open fire on the militants equipping the firing point and destroyed the machine gun crew. The enemy, which has numerical superiority, attempted to encircle russian servicemen. The group commander decided to withdraw towards those moving towards our reinforcements. Sergeant Bazarzhapov was given the task of covering the withdrawal of the group. Conducting targeted fire from small arms, Bazarzhapov with accurate fire and skillful movement on the battlefield destroyed a machine gun crew on a pickup truck, and also wounded three more nationalists, thereby constraining the actions of the militants and reducing the speed of their offensive. Moving away from his own, Zhalsan continued to destroy his pursuers. Bazarzhapov's bold and professional actions allowed the two Russian groups to build defenses and, waiting for the militants, to destroy them. Thanks to the courage and selfless actions of Zhalsan Bazarzhapov, the activities of the sabotage and reconnaissance group in the specified area were stopped. "" LISTEN AS WELL.

Among the participants of this year's award are people of various professions and ages. But all of them conduct active public work, aimed primarily at preserving and popularizing history. The best educational film of the year was ""Donbass: Revival"". This series of films was shot by the RUN TV channel. It tells about what the Ukrainian Nazis left behind, now knocked out of Russian territories, and how the life of the region is returning to a peaceful course. The heroes of the tape were ordinary residents of Donbass. By their example, they show that they are ready at any time to stand up for their relatives, land and home. The absolute winner of the ""Knowledge"" award was Yuriy Podolyaka. This well-known military observer, journalist and blogger managed to find the key to the hearts of millions of people. For eight years now, he has been openly telling his huge audience about what is happening in the Donbass. At the same time, in his blog, Yuri is not trying to convince anyone, his goal is to convey to people the thoughts of why we are forced to enter into this struggle today, why we cannot evade it. In addition, Yuri is one of those who constantly calls to support the participants of the CBO. Its record collection is almost 500 million rubles. KSTAT.

High-quality highways with a good flat surface, without pits - such people used to see only on TV in programs about other countries. The Ukrainian authorities did not reach the hands of a good repair of roads. Even such an important transport artery as the route between Melitopol and Berdyansk was in a deplorable state. - You have no idea what condition it was in! - says a resident of Berdyansk Leonid Brosak. - A major track, and everything is like a sieve. You go and pray that the suspension doesn't fall off. Now, for the first time in many years, a comprehensive repair of this federal highway is being carried out. Builders-chefs from other Russian regions help. According to the regional Ministry of Transport, new asphalt will be laid on 109 kilometers of track. And for an uninterrupted process - so that nothing slows down the work - three asphalt concrete plants were opened in the region at once. Again, by the help of visiting specialists. The Melitopol-Berdyansk highway is being repaired around the clock by about 300 workers. 128 units of equipment are involved. And this is only the beginning of the ""road revival"". In 2023, work is planned to restore regional and inter-municipal roads throughout the Zaporizhzhya region. Meanwhile, in Akimovka, the work also does not subside. They began to put in order a section of the road Akimovka - Vladimirovka, which used to cause a lot of trouble to local motorists. The plans are to repair all the streets in the village. - This year, we completed the road works quite recently, by December 20. And in the spring, as soon as the weather permits, we will begin the reconstruction of almost all the streets of the Akimovsky district, - the head of the Akimovka administration Maxim Zubarev pleased. In the meantime, the laying of asphalt at the entrance to the central market is being completed here. Soon the road will become smooth and safe. The repair of the road on Pushkin Street has almost come to an end. Previously, residents of Akimovka said about Zheleznodorozhnaya Street: ""Neither to pass nor to pass."" The dirt road resembled an off-road race track, and during the rain it turned into a viscous swamp. Now the road was sprinkled with cutting down old asphalt. But this is temporary: very soon it will be overhauled. More new asphalt is being laid on Young Patriots Street. The head of Akimovka Maxim Zubarev said that local road workers are helped by workers from the Krasnodar Territory. In total, 30 thousand square meters of road surface will be repaired in this area. In the Zaporozhye region as a whole, by the end of the year, 90 thousand square meters of roads were put in order.

In Melitopol, the oldest school was repaired: the educational buildings, the sports and assembly hall were glazed, the roof was completely replaced, the topographic platform was restored, from which a view of the city opens. Melitopol school No. 24 was updated - cracks in the basement were removed, handrails, ramps were painted, ceilings were whitewashed. Workers noticeably refreshed the appearance in the school of the village of Fruktovoye: they painted the walls, whitewashed the ceilings, replaced the lampshades. In the school of Berdyansk, it was necessary to work hard, as a lot of work was required in the basement, with the entrance group, and the floors and lighting were also replaced. A lot of money and effort was spent on the restoration of buildings after the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The school in the village of Kuibyshevo (Kamenka) in the Pologovsky district was helped to repair by chiefs from the Penza region. The builders put new windows, replaced the batteries so that the guys did not freeze in the winter. After the opening of the school, the chefs even visited the students, learned about their successes and presented gifts. By the way, Penza residents repaired two more schools in the Pologovsky district - in the urban-type settlement of Rozovka and the city of Tokmak. The House of Culture in Primorsky Posad has been waiting for repairs for two years. Due to the deterioration of the structure, the canopy of the building collapsed. All these years, the employees of the DC could not move the situation from the dead point. But this year the situation has changed - the administration of the Melitopol district has allocated everything necessary for repair, and now the Palace of Culture is working in full force. His House of Culture appeared in the village of Shevchenko. But it was equipped by the residents themselves. First, we chose a room - the building of the former school, where the village library is located. And the authorities of the Melitopol district helped with the repair. Now there are bright events for children and adults. No less attention is paid to recreation parks. A large repair awaits the favorite Melitopol Gorky Park. Paving slabs and lighting have already been replaced here, and the plans include the reconstruction of attractions. Behind the building of the former cinema ""Elegy"" dismantled dilapidated buildings, there will be a recreation area. The park in the village of Efremovka, which has fallen into decay over the past decades, was restored: trees were cut down, and the territory was overgrown with weeds. Not indifferent residents helped to improve the park. By the way, by the end of the year in the Zaporozhye region, the former names of alleys and parks will be returned, as well as historical monuments destroyed from 2014 to 2022 will be restored. This order was signed by the Governor of the region Yevgeny Balitsky."

One of the first to lead round dances together with Santa Claus and the Snow Maiden were the young guests of charity Christmas trees for the children of military personnel. On December 14 and 15, at the site of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, GITIS students arranged interactive fairy-tale performances for them. - Here, probably, you can remember how during the Great Patriotic War, brigades were also formed from the actors who remained in Moscow, and from the actors of the theaters who were evacuated, who left and performed. In this case, of course, we do not risk students, but it would also be wrong and impossible to stay away. This is our small contribution to the common cause, - said the rector of GITIS Grigory Zaslavsky. And before the start of the Christmas trees, the children were shown a selection of ten author's films of the studios ""Bee"" and ""VGIK Debut"" - a gift from the Association of Animated Cinema of Russia. On December 16, directors and artists of the Tavrida art cluster gathered to please the little spectators and pay tribute to the feat of their fathers. For a few hours, the children became part of exciting fairy-tale stories with surprises and creative gifts. During the last pre-New Year week, more than a hundred children of Donbass soldiers will visit the New Year's tree in the House of Youth in Moscow, receive gifts and just admire the festive capital of Russia. As stated by the executive director of the public organization ""Russian Center"" Elena Evseeva, it is very important ""that children feel love"", it is important ""to give them a piece of peace and festive mood"". No less striking show programs and performances are held in the regions. Almost one and a half thousand people from the families of servicemen of Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk presented their incredible creativity to the artists of the legendary clowning theater ""Licedei"" from St. Petersburg. - Our art is to return adults to the world of childhood. Two hours away from this routine. To be children, to laugh, to be ourselves, to free ourselves from external shackles, standards,"" said Anvar Libabov, an actor at the Licedei Theatre. Ryazan, Tambov, Kazan, Tyumen, Krasnodar, Pyatigorsk, Murmansk - in these and other cities of the country New Year's events are organized at the highest level. And at each event, the organizers try to bring their own zest. For example, in Lipetsk, the regional government not only invited the children of the SVO participants to new Year's performances, but also provided their families with living green beauties. And in Vologda, the local presenter of the holidays became a real Santa Claus for the children of mobilized countrymen. She threw a cry among fellow animators and in a matter of days assembled a team of assistants. - Only such an event gives them the opportunity to feel that society cares about them. To know that we are proud of our defenders, that we are together! That we are there, we will help, we will support. If we can do something for these families, we will help, despite all the difficulties, - says Elena."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701162/,Igor YAKUNIN,2022-12-29,Battalions go to the breakthrough with a violin,In the zone of the SVO began their work front brigades of the Ministry of Defense of Russia,"The brigades included both mobilized and voluntarily came to help the liberated Donbass artists. According to the Ministry of Defense, the first such front-line creative team arrived in the Southern Group of Forces in the second half of November. And on November 19, in the restored Mariupol, she gave her first concert. This team includes the former violinist of the group ""Aquarium"" Andrei Reshetin, the leading actor of the theater ""Contemporary"" Evgeny Pavlov and other masters of stage art. These are musicians, dramatic actors, professional artist, circus performer and vocal performers. It can be considered that the Russian Ministry of Defense decided to revive time-tested traditions. It is worth recalling that during the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union, about two thousand front-line brigades were formed. They undoubtedly made a certain contribution to our common victory over German fascism. If you recall the footage of such films as ""Actress"", ""Father of a Soldier"", ""The Pig and the Shepherd"", as well as newsreels of those years, it becomes obvious: the artists of the front brigades were always waiting on the front line. Singers, musicians, artists of all genres raised the mood of fighters and fighting spirit. These creative and fearless people inspired the personnel. Songs performed by Shulzhenko, Ruslanova gave strength to those who tomorrow had to go on the attack. Now, during the period of a special military operation, all this is no less relevant. It's actually in demand. It is no coincidence that for the first time in the history of the modern Armed Forces of Russia, two front-line creative brigades have been formed. - After the announcement of partial mobilization, I received a summons. I arrived at the military recruitment office. Then, within 12 hours, he left for a military unit, - Yevgeny Pavlov, an actor of the Sovremennik Theater, recalled his journey. - Then I had a rather intense mobilization fee. And I'm really happy about that tension. Why? Yes, because when I was in military service, I did not receive such training. So thank you from me to the combatant. This experienced officer taught me a lot today. And so, after gaining solid skills in handling weapons, I had confidence that I had become a real soldier. But in the front brigade, our weapons... after all, it is, shall we say, of a different kind. We started performing gigs. Honestly, I can say: I have never met such a grateful viewer before. At the end of our speech, the fighters not only applaud. Officers, soldiers come up, thank you. Many wish creative success. Of course, such things are inspiring. Here you immediately understand how important your work is. It is also worth mentioning that on November 23, the agitation brigade of Russian Radio, which included Elena Sever, YurKiss, VladiMir, Roman Arkhipov and the Zemlyane group, performed in the zone of a special military operation."

The Order ""For Merit to the Fatherland"" of the highest degree was awarded to the acting head of the LPR Leonid Pasechnik. - You know that in 2014 we all together, the whole republic decided not to agree with the policy of nationalist Ukraine, decided to defend our land, decided to defend our history, decided to defend our opportunity to remain brothers with the people of Russia. Therefore, we have passed this path together, the whole republic, and I believe that this is not only my award - it is the award of every resident of the LPR,"" the head of the republic told the Russian president. After the award ceremony, Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with the acting head of the LPR. It discussed the main problems that are being solved in the republic today. Pasechnik spoke about the work of the only coal enterprise in the LPR - the republican fuel company Vostok Coal, where a difficult economic situation arose and there are not enough workers. Leonid Pasechnik asked Putin for support - to allocate money for people's wages and for the development of the enterprise. - As for assistance for today, we will certainly do it, especially subsidies for wages and for some other measures necessary to preserve the life of enterprises. We will also do this as soon as possible. It is only necessary to understand the volumes, - Vladimir Putin responded to the request. Pasechnik also spoke about medicine: he admitted that the work in this direction is well established, but the equipment in the clinics is outdated and major repairs in many medical institutions have not been done for many years. However, thanks to Russia's help, the situation began to change for the better. Also, the acting head of the LPR said that due to the lack of employees in the region, there are problems with communication, and asked the president to help with specialists. Vladimir Putin promised to assist in this matter. Since this was the first working meeting of the acting head of the LPR with the president, most residents of the republic closely followed its progress. - I could not believe that at this level there is a discussion of our problems. Our head clearly outlined everything, was not afraid, did not hesitate to talk about the problems and ask for specific help. And I am sure that everything will be resolved, everything will get better, - says Irina Vergun, a resident of Kirovsk. - I noticed that Vladimir Vladimirovich clearly knows that nothing was really done here under Ukraine, and during the conflict Kiev only destroyed everything. Vladimir Putin is interested in the development of our region so that people can live here with dignity. Luhansk resident Sergei Shcherbak says that the meeting between Pasechnik and Putin has fueled him with even greater hopes for a bright future. - Honestly, I thought that our Russian coal industry is not very interesting, that it already has enough ""black gold"". And it turned out that there is always a need for raw materials and that the miners will receive support,"" explains Sergey. - Therefore, it is pleasant that the industry, which lives for generations, will develop. Russia will help in this, and our people will not let you down - they will do everything that is required of them. According to Yulia Garanicheva, a resident of Alchevsk, residents of the republic already see changes for the better. ""But, of course, there is something to be desired,"" adds Julia. - If we do not take into account security issues, which for us first of all, we would like a greater and faster development of the sphere of banking services and insurance. In the housing and utilities sector, we also do not have everything smoothly. There are not enough specialists who have left, who are fighting."

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702024/,Victor BARANETS,2023-01-03,What really happened in Makiivka. The first conclusions from the tragedy with the Russian mobilized,Colonel Baranets named possible causes of the tragedy in Makiivka,"What you need to know about the emergency with the death of dozens of fighters on New Year's Eve - answers Colonel, military observer of ""KP"" Viktor Barane. According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the armed forces of Ukraine struck at the point of temporary deployment (LDPE) of the Russian military in the area of Makiivka (DPR). The Ministry of Defense spoke about 63 dead, a little later the department clarified that the number of servicemen who died in the tragedy increased to 89. The shelling was carried out from the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system. In total, six missiles were fired at the LDPE, two of them were shot down by air defense systems. According to unofficial information of sources in the military department of the Russian Federation, within 10 minutes after the tragedy (it happened at 00-01 on January 1), the commander of the special military operation, Army General Sergei Surovikin, informed Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu via closed communication. He, in turn, notified the President of Russia about the emergency. Vladimir Putin ordered to immediately begin an investigation into the causes of the tragedy. A commission of the Ministry of Defense was sent to Makiivka at the head (according to the source) ""with a very large military leader"" - his name has not yet been disclosed. Later, the Ministry of Defense issued an official statement. ""Immediately after the tragedy, the command and officers of this military unit, junior commanders and servicemen of other units, took all available measures to rescue the victims. First aid was provided, the wounded were evacuated to medical institutions,"" said Lieutenant General Sergey Sevryukov, First Deputy Head of the Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The return fire destroyed the launcher of the multiple launch rocket system, from which the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired at Makiivka. The bulk of the dead mobilized are from different regions, including the Samara Region. Governors already on January 1 created commissions of members of local governments. They are already organizing the funeral of the dead and determining the means of material assistance to their families. On local television and radio, in newspapers and social networks, thousands of people express condolences to the families of the victims. Work with the families of the victims has already begun. In social networks, an announcement appeared about the collection of assistance to ""our Samara guys, those who came under fire in Makiivka, but survived."" The headquarters of the special military operation sent a large batch of winter uniforms and medicines to Makiivka. All the wounded were transferred to the field hospitals and the district military hospital in Rostov. As you might expect, Ukrainian social networks and other media are happily triumphant. Rumors are swirling about the death toll. Predictions are already being made that ""a mighty blow to the Moskals will bring Moscow to its knees and bring it closer."" There are also well-known provocateurs among Ukrainian bloggers like Sharia, who appealed to the wives, mothers and children of the victims with a request to inform him of their personal data. And this is regarded as a criminal offense under Russian law. Not only that, on human grief, trying to make a ""hype"". So another big question is where the collected personal data of Russian soldiers will go later? Ukrainian special services? Or immediately American. There are a few main reasons for this. According to preliminary data (only the investigation will be able to tell the full picture), the leadership of the regiment of mobilized could irresponsibly treat the choice of the point of temporary deployment of personnel - people were placed in the building of the vocational school (PTU). In addition, despite the repeated demands of commanders to subordinates not to use mobile phones, this, again according to preliminary data, was ignored. On New Year's Eve, many fighters began to call their relatives. Some mobile specialists believe that this could well become a ""serious unmasking factor."" Ukrainian electronic warfare equipment (as well as US space reconnaissance) could easily detect a place of increased ""telephone activity""). In addition, it cannot be ruled out that Ukrainian agents worked in Makiivka, which gave a tip to their headquarters on the building of the vocational school. The main conclusion is to constantly remember that at the front the slightest violation of combat or disciplinary regulations is punished harshly. No wonder wise commanders have long said that every line of such statutes is written in blood. And a careless attitude to orders often ends in grief. Some residents of Makiivka, who witnessed the tragedy, discuss its causes in their own way. Some mobilized survivors believe that the responsibility lies with the regiment's commander, Colonel Roman Yenikeev. Others categorically disagree with them: the colonel's fault is only that he followed the instructions of his superiors and could not achieve the resettlement of the unit entrusted to him in accordance with the realities of the front. According to the adviser to the head of the DPR Rostislav Antonov, it is simply about common sense and changing approaches to reduce the risk of defeat of our fighters: ""You need to disperse, you need to place them in shelters, you need to place them separately from the equipment and from the actual ammunition. These are some fairly obvious things that for some reason turn out not to be obvious when making certain decisions. In addition, apparently, it is time to abandon the illusion that the enemy will not reach the locations of the mobilized, and indeed any units, if they stand in a direct zone of destruction. "" It is necessary to restore the strictest order with mobile phones - in combat conditions they become traitors to their owners and those who are close to them. And that leads to casualties. Commanders are obliged not to allow a large crowding of personnel and military equipment even in places of temporary deployment. Regardless of whether the unit is located on the front or in the rear, camouflage measures must be strictly observed. And the loss of vigilance inevitably leads to trouble. In the places of deployment of troops and in the frontline zone, military counterintelligence should work actively, cleaning up Ukrainian agents and enemy gunners. The state of emergency in Makiivka (and not only in it) requires us to learn another lesson – to significantly strengthen air and missile defense. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are obliged to issue orders and directives to the troops, the implementation of which would exclude the repetition of the Makeyevka tragedy."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702083/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-04,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on January 4, 2023: the Ukrainian ambassador to Israel wants to become persona non grata, and the Prime Minister of Ukraine promised small Ukrainians small power plants","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on January 4, 2023","Several European leaders called Zelensky and promised him as much help as Ukraine would need. Among the callers, we can especially note the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who could not correctly name US President Joseph Biden. Rutte was pathetic but vague in the conversation. His promises boiled down to assurances that the Netherlands ""will help Ukraine not only to survive, but also to win."" The promise from a country that resisted the Nazi invasion in 1940 for 5 days must, of course, be taken seriously. But the head of the British government was more specific. He promised new supplies of military equipment in the coming weeks and months. And he also counts on the victory of Kiev. ""According to the Prime Minister, Ukraine can count on the fact that the United Kingdom will continue to provide it with long-term support, as demonstrated by the recent dispatch of 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine,"" Sunak's office said about the content of the talks. In addition, work is underway to transfer additional military equipment to Ukraine in the coming weeks and months to ensure its victory on the battlefield. So many things were promised that you can not carry away. The independent government has found a way to deal with Russian missile (and drone) strikes. At a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers, Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmygal announced that in order to create a decentralized energy system, the country plans to build small power plants, preferring solar, wind, hydrogeneration and hydrogen technologies. As for hydrogen, this will probably begin immediately after the launch of the first hyperloop, and as for everything else, it is a very real plan. Theoretically. But why is pedal-powered bicycle generation unfairly overlooked? And the generation from jumping? Inexhaustible reserves, given that we are talking about Ukraine. You can also, by the way, organize small melting furnaces like a mini-blast furnace at each hut near the cherry orchard, as was done in China by order of the Great Helmsman. It will be replaced by the same metallurgical giant Arcelor, which was stopped. The Chinese, however, soon abandoned this ""metal"" from home mini-melters because of their low efficiency and quality, but they most likely lacked perseverance, not Ukrainians after all. But as for the belief that Russian missiles will not fall into small power plants, it is better to immediately get rid of these illusions. There is only one small, but very significant question – who will build all this. Kiev's new diplomatic victory was not long in coming. After telephone conversations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ended in nothing, Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevhen Korniychuk decided that relations between the two states were too smooth and decided to cheer them up. And, no less, but criticized the new Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen for holding telephone talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. ""This conversation is a change in Israel's policy,"" the Kiev envoy said and expressed regret that Jerusalem did not notice ""barbaric strikes on Ukraine."" Korneychuk really wants to become the hero of a new scandal in Ukrainian-Israeli relations, like the same Melnyk in German-Ukrainian. But Evgeny does not take into account two factors - Israel is not Germany, they will not tolerate boorishness for a long time. And second, no less important, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken personally asked Cohen to convey his message to Lavrov. Eugene, did you understand where you were going? 10 years without the right of correspondence shines on you for this in the current Independent. Once again - and in the best case ""you will hear, yak bjoli buzz kolo khaty"" (bees buzz near the house). However, ten years of sky in a cage in Ukraine can now be grabbed for almost anything. An employee of the Kharkiv TV channel ""Tonis Center"" in April began to make leaflets. Well, how to do? He drew models and sent his daughter to Russia. The models used Russian patriotic symbols - the St. George ribbon, the appeals ""Work, brothers! Victory is ours! We are on our land!"" etc. Apparently, the man helped his daughter to perform some kind of educational task. He did not distribute leaflets on the street, he did not engage in propaganda, he did not arrange actions. But they were unlucky, either they reported, or they calculated, in general, they caught it. The other day, the ""most humane court in the world"" – the Ukrainian one – sentenced him to 10 years in prison. It's not going to be a bit of a jerk here. Except that when Ukraine switches to the Latin alphabet, he will be able to try to explain that he was just trying to draw a new alphabet, just started with the last letter. During the New Year's Eve in Kiev, 19 launches of festive fireworks during the curfew were recorded. One person from the Podilsky district of the Ukrainian capital was detained by the police, and now he faces a criminal case and a real, albeit short term. However, according to information from his acquaintances, he does not despair and does not intend to appeal the verdict. And all because of the fact that now he will not be able to mobilize and send him to the front. Something suggests that now not only ""Gerani"" and ""Kalibr"" are being squandered in Kiev. Because this is the cheapest way to get away from mobilization. The State Council of Turkey approved the withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention, which introduces the concept of gender and launches the legalization of same-sex marriage. Recall that gender does not mean the biological sex of a person, but who he feels / designates / identifies. Thus, Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul Convention completely, and now it is legally fixed. But Ukraine, on the contrary, signed the Istanbul Convention this summer in the person of Vladimir Zelensky and officially ratified. In general, where Volodymyr Zelensky entered, Recep Tayyip Erdogan came out of there. - The public relations directors of the Foreign Legion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a well-known fraudster in Europe, are accused of stealing $2.5 million worth of medicines for the military and significant amounts of donations she has collected. - Lithuania has not paid compensation for heating to citizens for several months, the amount of debt to citizens has already exceeded several million euros. - In France, where until recently the pride of the country was nuclear energy, and the republic itself was an energy donor for neighboring countries, local authorities began distributing coupons for firewood. - The mayor of Dnepropetrovsk Boris Filatov proposed to extend decommunization and de-Russification to food and to abandon salads ""Olivier"" and ""herring under a fur coat"". And he boasted that holodets, unlike ""Russian dishes"", can eat for a week. And he won't get tired. And I got tired of Olivier on the second day. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702062/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-03,Zelensky and Netanyahu did not satisfy each other. Negotiations between the two leaders ended in failure,Their first talks ended with the President of Ukraine and the Prime Minister of Israel separating like ships at sea.,"Before the New Year, telephone talks were held between the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and the new head of the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu. Both of them needed something important and non-standard from the interlocutor. Netanyahu, for example, hoped that Ukraine would vote against the anti-Israel resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on the status of the Palestinian territories. This is a very difficult task, given that out of almost a hundred votes on such resolutions, Ukraine has never sided with Israel. Most often she voted against, but sometimes she also abstained. Zelensky was required from Jerusalem to supply air defense, in particular, the Iron Dome system. Kiev has been bleeding it for more than a year, but after February 24, requests for supply (not even for sale, since Kiev does not have money for iron dome) became an obsessive ""fix idea"", approximately as for Hitler dreams of a ""wunderwaffe"". Expert opinions that this air defense system would be useless for Kiev were dismissed one after another. -Want to! Zelensky shouted and twitched his legs. In general, the parties started from such initial positions. Zelensky was clearly in a losing position, because Netanyahu is still a beast, none of the pikey vests would put a finger in his mouth (even if Benjamin agreed to this, which is strongly doubtful). Netanyahu led the country when Zelensky walked under the piano. Also for the reason that the vote was scheduled for a specific date, and the assistance of the air defense is such an issue that is not solved from the glove box. Vaughn and Mr. Biden promised a Patriot to Kiev, and now it turns out that there are still as many as 50 weeks of training Ukrainians to work and repair complexes. And only after that, the American ZRPK will go to Nezalezhnaya to stand on combat duty. Unless, of course, there is a place to stand up and where to insert these missiles. In general, Netanyahu promised to think and discuss Zelensky's problems sometime later, in the future. Clearly counting on the satisfaction of his request hinting at this. But Zelensky did not promise anything, and as a result, Ukraine's permanent representative to the UN simply did not vote. Nohow. ""Zelensky decided that we would not attend the vote to give a chance to relations with Netanyahu,"" an anonymous Ukrainian official told Axios, who prepared the material on the results of the first talks, who summed up the conversation with a brief summary. - The two leaders were not satisfied and did not get what they wanted. It is difficult to call such a step ""preserving the chance of a relationship"", it is even more difficult to consider it as such. The most interesting thing happened later. After these telephone conversations between Zelensky and the current Prime Minister of Israel, the new Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen announced that ""Israel at the highest level has resumed direct contacts with the Russian Federation and intends to talk less publicly about the Ukrainian-Russian issue."" ""On the Russia-Ukraine issue, we will do one thing for sure - to say less publicly,"" Cohen said, but publicly stressed that ""significant humanitarian assistance to Ukraine"" will continue, but he refused to answer all questions about arms supplies to Kiev. It is clear that Israel is holding back relations with Iran on this issue, but it seems that even without this, Netanyahu has concluded which of the negotiators is a priority. At least from the warring parties. Moreover, Netanyahu has known Putin for a very long time, and from his own experience he was convinced that it is difficult to get a promise from Putin, but if the Russian president gave his word, he would do everything to keep it. And with Zelensky, apparently, there is no such confidence. Which, by the way, he proved by his behavior. LISTEN AS WELL. How has 2022 changed the global economy?"

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4701968/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-03,"Air defense from pickles and other ""feats"": Zelensky was accused of imitating Ukrainian victories before the West",The Times predicted that in 2023 the President of Ukraine will be engaged in imitation of victories before the West,"Journalist Mark Galeotti in an article for the newspaper The Times predicted that in the coming 2023, Vladimir Zelensky will be engaged in imitation of Ukrainian victories before the West. - Zelensky is well aware that in 2023 there is a danger of ""fatigue from Ukraine"" in the West. Therefore, in the new year, the administration of the Ukrainian leader will resume the campaign to dispel this fatigue. Zelenskiy will focus on raising the stakes, portraying Ukraine as the main fighter in the existential battle for civilization, the newspaper's columnist wrote in his column. - Zelensky will continue to simulate military successes in hostilities to create a positive picture for the West, so as not to lose financial support. And since the West expects that its ""investments"" in the Zelensky regime in one form or another should return with a return, then, according to Galeotti, the President of Ukraine ""will have to continue to demonstrate to his patrons that the return of these investments is possible through continued success on the battlefield."" It is difficult to deny a Western journalist sanity, but Nostradamus from Mark, to put it mildly, none. Because what he describes is not the future, but the present. Not a prognosis, but a diagnosis. And this is perfectly proved by the same New Year's address of Zelensky. Built emotionally, in the best traditions of show business, with psychological calculation, it would be impeccable if Zelensky did not lie in almost every word. It is simply amazing that to illustrate Russian strikes on ukrainian civilians, the team working for Zelensky chose episodes of the destruction of Ukraine and Ukrainians by the Armed Forces of Ukraine themselves: a high-rise building in Kiev, where a Ukrainian air defense missile flew, shelling of Kharkiv in the spring, the destruction of the Mriya, which was burned in Gostomel by the VSUshniki themselves, the strike of a Ukrainian missile on the railway station in Kramatorsk, the provocation with the explosion of a dramatet in Mariupol, etc.,  Everything that Zelensky presented to the public as crimes of Russian ""barbarians"" were indeed crimes, but they were committed by the Ukrainian military, which is irrefutably proved by evidence and facts, as well as the notorious blow to the detention center in Yelenivka, where prisoners of war were kept, including from the Azov regiment banned in Russia. For at least the reason that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not have the Highmars MLRS systems in service, from which the missile strike on the detention center was inflicted. And in each such case, there was evidence. As for the feats of the Ukrainians themselves in the fight against the ""Akhressor country"", here Zelensky could not pass by the invented fake woman, who allegedly knocked down the unmanned vehicle with a can of salted tomatoes. This housewife has already become the same meme as the drunken grandfather who ""shot"" the Russian Su-34 from his balcony with a hunting rifle, but Zelensky spoke very seriously about the ""feat with the can"" very seriously, without even smiling once. The words that Ukraine both protects the whole world and civilization, and feeds the world, were also heard in his address. So Zelensky is already trading in Ukraine like a visiting salesman, advertising his battered and heavily used goods. Here you have the protection of peace, and attempts to pass off anything as amazing military successes, so as not to lose military and financial assistance. And to fulfill the main task assigned to him. By the way, it was once again formulated with the utmost cynical frankness by US Senator Lindsey Graham: ""With our support and our money, Ukraine will fight Russia to the last person!"" Mind you, we don't say it. And when it comes to that, it turns out that Zelensky, Shmygal, Yermak and even Kuleba and Poroshenko, not to mention Klimkin, are not Ukrainians at all. Zelensky will put on a show, just as he did to this day. Because, regardless of the desire of the audience, it is necessary for producers. They need, if not real victories, then at least imitations of successes. And the simulator from Zelensky is famous. Ask Erdogan, at least the piano. LISTEN AS WELL.

Its highest form is when the same stupidity is relayed several times. As, for example, the legend that the popular extras around Vladimir Putin are played by specially selected employees of the FSO. And their command is so stupid that from time to time it slips under the cameras of the same people. The reason to talk about this again appeared just before the New Year, when the Supreme Commander-in-Chief came to the headquarters of the Southern Military District to present awards to our heroes of the Special Military Operation, record a New Year's address against their background and communicate with the military in an informal setting. One of those who received the award from the hands of the president was Guards Captain Anna Sidorenko. During Putin's speech, she stands on his right shoulder. The officer unwittingly caused another gossip. ""Inquisitive minds"" took out archival photographs and gave out a ""sensation"". Look, on a presidential fishing trip, a similar woman in the company of three other men communicates with Putin. But the shooting of the service in the temple, behind the back of the president is still the same four led by a blonde. And here are the protocol shots of some tea party - and again ""the same in the arena"". Anna Sidorenko ""evil tongues"" were immediately assigned to another role in the modern interpretation of the film ""Ivan Vasilyevich Changes Profession"". The truth in this delirious ""sensation"" is one – these are really the same people, with the exception of the officer from the president's New Year's greetings. Let's find out. As evidence, three photographs are slipped to us. The first recorded a meeting between Vladimir Putin and fishermen during a trip to Ilmen in September 2016. Among them is the owner of the fishing enterprise Larisa Sergukhina. The fishermen then told the president about their problems and asked for help to solve them. In the next photo, the same fishermen together with Sergukhina stand behind the president in the temple. ""Aaah! The villains shouted. ""The Fishermen's Are Burned."" Although on Christmas Day 2017, all the media wrote that the president went to a solemn service in the Spassky Cathedral in the St. George Monastery of Veliky Novgorod. Well, since he was in the Novgorod region, he called those fishermen to the service. And after the service with those same fishermen, I sat down to drink tea and discuss how the problems they talked about in September were being solved. Actually, the third photo is a tea party and is. The woman in uniform shown for this New Year has nothing to do with these fishermen. Well, maybe it looks something like Sergukhina. And it would be nice if the Ukrainian media dispersed it. Their homegrown throw in, and the svidom happily pick up. And neither of them has the courage to admit a mistake. By the way, in addition to the guard of the captain of the medical service Anna Sidorenko, other participants of the special military operation stood behind the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who were awarded state awards and valuable gifts that day. Among them, for example, Guards Corporal Timofey Matveev, awarded the title of Hero of Russia - senior mechanic-driver of the T-72 tank was awarded ""for repeated manifestations of courage and heroism."" A volunteer, Private Alexander Amelin, received the Order of Courage from the hands of the President. Vladimir Putin hung the same award on the chest of the commander of the artillery regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Zharkikh. The Order of Courage was also awarded to Anna Sidorenko, who pulled more than one wounded person from the battlefield. And she never served a day in the FSO."

And we are talking not only about substations, we are talking, unfortunately, also about power plants - thermal, hydroelectric power plants, combined heat and power plants that generate electricity and heat for our cities,"" he said. According to Kudritsky, it may take years to fully restore the country's energy system. And backup capacity has lower reliability, as a result of which each new blow to the infrastructure of the system suffers harder. "" Every next attack does not add health to our energy system. It is becoming more and more difficult to repair the damage, - admitted the head of the board of Ukrenergo. Since January 1, priests who are considered ""agents of the Kremlin"" have been denied access to two churches of the Upper Lavra - the Assumption Cathedral - the main temple of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra and the Refectory Church. - To date, we do not have access to the National Reserve of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, but there is access to the territory that was ours (Lower Lavra). They are all ours, these territories, but we are not allowed there,"" said Metropolitan Pavel, rector of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. According to him, the lease agreement of the Assumption and Refectory Cathedrals continues, since no one informed him about their non-extension. On the eve of the legal department of the UOC said that the church has the right to use the temples of the Upper Lavra, despite the refusal of the National Reserve to extend the lease agreements for 2023. Attacks on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church intensified late last year. A number of clerics were arrested, they were charged with cooperation with Russian special services and infringement of the rights of believers. Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kirill Budanov shared his forecasts for the year. So, according to his calculations, Russia has two massive strikes on Ukraine. This is an old song sung by various Ukrainian officials in uniform and without. At first, we predicted that we would exhaust all our reserves in July, then by September, and then by the New Year. However, the latest strikes show that the missiles do not end, no matter how much Kiev would like it. Budanov believes that until March Russia will have a critical situation with weapons, the industry is allegedly not coping. But, unlike Ukraine, we have a really working military-industrial complex, which works in three shifts. But Ukraine is completely dependent on the supply of Western weapons. Budanov also dreamed about the victory of Kiev, which should be expressed in the return of Ukraine to the borders of 1991. That is, with Crimea. Well, here, as they say, no comment."

Let's start at the very beginning, when the evacuation of residents began. - I visited Donbass from Rostov, it was one of the last flights when planes were still flying. I went to refugee sites. And then it seemed to me that this was an information operation. I didn't know yet that we were going to launch a special military operation. Then there was a lot of talk that Ukraine had pulled serious forces to the demarcation line, that it was about to go on the offensive in the Donbass. - When you first caught yourself thinking that there should be special operations. - I've seen this accumulation. But I did not expect that we would start on such a broad front – from Chernobyl to Kherson. I thought that there would be a local operation to liberate Donbass. And that's where all our involvement will stop. Probably, this was after the statement of the Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, when he said in one of his speeches that any attempts by Ukraine to resolve the territorial issue by force would be suppressed by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. That was back in 2021. - Then there was a meeting of the Security Council. - I remember what emotions there were and the expectation of a speedy deliverance. Donbass perceived it as follows: finally! It was, if not euphoria, then such cautious optimism. - Where were you on the night when the special operation was announced. - In the Luhansk People's Republic. That night I was present at the attempt of Ukrainian troops to attack our bank of the Seversky Donets. Then they crossed the river, along which the front line passed, two company-tactical groups, occupied two dominant heights. A few hours before the start of the special operation, they were knocked from these heights back into the river by tanks. Perhaps it was reconnaissance by combat on the part of Ukraine. Perhaps this could be the beginning of the offensive of the Ukrainian army on the LPR. It was serious, heavy fighting. - How did you know it all started. - After this attack was repulsed, I was driving in a car from Lugansk to Donetsk. As soon as we crossed the border, the Internet immediately appeared and the ""lightning"" flew, the first videos: missiles are flying, exploding in Kiev, someone is already chasing fakes about the mass landing of Russian troops in the Odessa region, about the landing of our troops in the Mykolaiv region from large landing ships ... A complete sense of the unreality of what is happening. - At what point did you catch yourself thinking that the special operation would drag on. - In Raisins, probably. I sat there for almost two months. We slowly took the settlements, and then it was as if we had our foreheads rested. I was there for two months. And all this time we tried to take, I am directly trembling from this toponym, the village of Dolgenkoye. Then we will approach it, then we will be thrown away from it. We thought that now we would approach Slavyansk from the north. And we didn't even come to the highway that supplied the enemy's raisin grouping. And then it became clear that this is a window to Slavyansk, we are just gradually running out of strength. This later resulted in partial mobilization. - You were on the Kiev direction in March. Then it was decided to regroup the troops. That was the first time we heard that wording. - I'm not a military strategist, not a general of the General Staff, I don't see the whole picture. I felt like you could dig in and get defensive. But I had little idea what was happening on other fronts. I did not always understand how things were going in Kharkiv region, Kherson region – in general, there was some kind of terra incognita. Being on the spot, we realized that, apparently, in other directions, too, not everything is smooth. And some forces need to be transferred there. - There is a lot of talk that the people who fight on the other side are the same Russian people as we are. Or not. - It seems to me that the aggressive national building of the last 8.5 years, which was built on extreme forms of Russophobia, on confronting an external enemy, has done its job. You go into the liberated cities - there are ripples in the eyes from zhovto-blakit. In each park there is a monument to the zakhistnik batkivshchyna (defender of the motherland - Ukrainian). On each school there is a marble plaque with the deceased hero of the ATO from this village. And it's paying off. These people do not consider themselves Russians. - What else can you note positive at the end of actually the year of the special operation. - There are hints of the formation of a reconnaissance and strike circuit - when scouts directly transmit the coordinates of the target to the gunners. Now it takes only two minutes from target detection to impact. Previously, it was a huge long chain of reports that went first up, then went down. When they gave the go-ahead to fire, there was nowhere to shoot. We finally have our Lancet kamikaze drones, which are now knocking out air defense systems, various radars, and communications equipment. New opportunities have appeared - the notorious ""Geranium-2"", which terrifies the enemy. We finally had meaningful attempts to identify enemy air defenses. We have recently started launching false targets for which it works. Something high-altitude immediately arrives there. - The mobilized were not all right. - They've more or less leveled off. These are people with combat experience, several months on the front line. A woman writes to me here: in Russia there are 150,000 trained mobilized, why are they not rotated unprepared, who are sitting on the front? I answer that those people who sit on the front line for two months, they will give a head start to those who have been trained in Russia for two months. When a person from civilian life falls into a trench, knee-deep in mud and water, everything explodes around, his life is turned upside down. Psychologically, you can't be prepared for that. But gradually they get used to it and become real seasoned warriors who already receive state awards, show miracles of heroism in the same Ugledar direction. Ordinary guys from the Russian hinterland. And this, too, can not but rejoice. If we draw historical parallels even further, the mobilized army won the Great Patriotic War. The professional army ended in 1941. READ ALSO. How and when the special operation in Ukraine will end: military commander Steshin gave an honest answer.

The corresponding statement was made on the air of the Ukrainian TV channel ""Rada"". According to him, there is no question of prompt troubleshooting here - it takes months, or even years, to restore stable operation, the expert says. ""The damage is significant, and it takes months, if not years, to fully restore the power grid,"" Kudritsky said. According to him, most of the power facilities are damaged, there are also objects that are completely destroyed. ""And we are talking here not only about Ukrenergo substations, we are also talking about power plants - thermal, hydroelectric power plants, combined heat and power plants,"" Kudrytskyi said. The power engineer added that the most serious problems are recorded in the energy sectors of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions, as well as the districts of Kherson region controlled by Kyiv. Why is another panic statement by the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine really important? The thing is that the energy structure is critically important for the transportation of weapons, the logistics of troops, the rupture of the chains of restoration of damaged military equipment of Ukraine and so on. The strategic goal of the command, in fact, is to turn the tide in the stalled conflict. And the main advantage of the Russian Federation now is the latest and most powerful weapons that can break the supply system of the enemy army. As political scientist Alexander Astafov said on the air of Radio KP, strikes on infrastructure follow a clear plan of the command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Thus, the initiative in the conflict is gradually passing into the hands of Russia. It's just a matter of the generals' decision – when the damage is enough to move on to decisive action. Read a detailed explanation in the full interview of the political scientist. By the way, a new powerful blow to the military infrastructure of Ukraine and related energy facilities was inflicted by the Russian military quite recently - on the morning of Thursday, December 29. The strongest hit were Kiev and Odessa, where there were significant interruptions in the movement of trains in almost all directions, which, of course, created additional difficulties for Ukraine in supplying ammunition to the front line."

In this regard, the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" decided to discuss with a member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region Vladimir Rogov the reasons for what is happening and to understand the circumstances of the attacks of the region. ""Under constant fire is Tokmak - a city in the Zaporozhye region, located a few dozen kilometers from the line of contact ... There are flights to Vasilyevka, There was a shelling of Prishib, Mikhaylovka, in general, about 6-7 settlements that are hit by heavy artillery, mlRS, trying to use attack drones and other moments,"" Rogov said. Rogov noted that the targets of the shelling are lined up in a certain chain, in connection with which ""additional security measures are being introduced and not only in the Zaporizhzhya region, but also in other new territories of the Russian Federation."" To the question of the presenter about the incidents in Melitopol and Vasilyevka, and specifically the commandant's office in the latter, Rogov replied that there were injured and dead. ""If we talk about Melitopol, then, according to preliminary data, yes, it was air defense, so far no information has appeared about the victims or about the destruction. That is, after those inspections, so there is a hope that everything worked out, thank God, ""says a member of the council of the regional administration about the events in Melitopol. ""As for Vasilyevka, there was, apparently, a criminal plan, because first a blow was struck and, when the Ministry of Emergency Situations officers arrived to rake up the rubble and save people, at that time a second blow was inflicted,"" Rogov clarified the situation about the commandant's office in Vasilyevka. Regarding the situation at the Zaporizhzhya NPP (ZNPP), he described it as ""stably tense"". According to him, work is underway to restart the station, to increase the level of its safety and ""in this regard, the appointment of a new head of administration."" ""Now there is cooperation with Rosatom throughout the country, plus repair work of the ARUA - the switchgear - and other lines that will ensure an uninterrupted supply of energy to the nuclear power plant so that it operates in cold and hot stop mode,"" Rogov explained, noting the importance of the ZNPP for providing Energodar, as well as protecting the dome with radioactive waste. In addition, Rogov noted the discussions around the transfer of the ZNPP zone to Ukraine and the statements of its President Volodymyr Zelensky about ""forceful"" interference in the transition procedure, which, in his opinion, are ""disingenuous"" in nature and do not guarantee the safety of the station. ""Russia clearly voiced the proposals that were - that is, the cessation of shelling, the non-landing of paratroopers, Zelensky's militants, to seize the nuclear power plant and the protection of nuclear power plants by people with small arms and the lack of heavy equipment at the nuclear power plant. Strictly speaking, Russia has already fulfilled the last two points, without any international memorandums and other things,"" Rogov concluded."

According to the lady, Russia has several scenarios for the development of events, but the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine does not have time to get information about them ""because of the short time intervals that pass between the sending of orders and their execution."" If translated, it turns out something like this: the Moskals are to blame for the ignorance of the Ukrainian military command, since they too quickly follow orders. In general, there is nothing to cover. Electricity consumption in Ukraine is growing - such a statement was made by Ukrenergo. - Electricity consumption in Ukraine is growing due to a gradual decrease in temperature and the intensification of business after the holidays, - the company said in a statement in the Telegram channel. The energy company also reported that ensuring the balance in the energy system in all regions of the country introduced consumption limits, exceeding which leads to the application of emergency restrictions. That is, to the outages, to which Ukrainians will have to get used to. After all, Russian strikes on military infrastructure, as well as on related civilian facilities, will continue. Thus, Russian troops complicate the delivery of equipment and ammunition to the front line. As Zelensky said in December last year, it is not possible to restore the energy system of Ukraine now. In Dnepropetrovsk (in Ukraine this city is called the Dnieper) the monument to the Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Matrosov was dismantled.

With the beginning of the SVO, he enlisted in the ranks of volunteers: he evacuated the residents of Kherson, took the humanitarian to the front. - Do you know what is the most useless of all humanitarian aid? He asks. I shrug my shoulders in response. - Cereals in packages, - says Yuri. - You bring kilograms, and the fighters throw up their hands - how do we cook them?. Soldiers do not always have the opportunity to cook themselves a hot meal. Obviously, that is why dry borscht from Masha's mother - such a nickname stuck to the 53-year-old Crimean Woman Maria Varlamova for a long time - became a real salvation. I poured a set of sachets into a cup, poured boiling water, after 15 minutes - the real rich soup is ready. With vegetables, meat - almost like at home. Her friends say that caring is her middle name. She was born in a small town near Kharkov. In her youth, she moved to Krivoy Rog, opened her own tailoring studio there. There she also took under the wing of young students-cutters, who called her mother. And after 30 years, she moved to the Crimea, where she has been living for 22 years. Her only son grew up and studied here, and a grandson was born. Maria - designer, costume designer. In the seasons she worked as a cook in sanatoriums. Recently, she has become seriously interested in psychology and astrology. Now he conducts trainings for those who wish. That's what he does for a living. With the beginning of the special operation, Masha's mother became a volunteer. I found lists in volunteer groups and bought what I could - bandages, cotton wool, medicines, food. And in early October, she came up with the idea - why not send soups to the front as dry rations. The idea of dry soups was born at archaeological excavations. In such expeditions, Maria worked as a cook for 12 years. ""The conditions were extreme: a huge plateau without a single tree under the scorching sun,"" she says. - I had to twist to store the same vegetables for as long as possible. In the sun, carrots and beets were dried, and at home I made blanks in advance in dryers. Housewives have long been popular with special dryers in which you can dry vegetables, fruits, mushrooms for the winter. In scientific parlance, this is called dehydration (complete removal of moisture), and dried ingredients are called sublimates. For two months now, dozens of people have been participating in the project ""Borscht, soups and porridges to the front from Masha's mother"" throughout Russia. Mostly women. They call themselves dryers because their main task is to dry the ingredients for borscht and package them in bags. Dry soups, borscht and cereals are products that are completely ready for consumption. Packaged in small vacuum bags. The menu of Masha's mother is diverse: borscht with meat, lean borscht with mushrooms and beans, buckwheat soup with mushrooms, pea soup with smoked meats ... Something can simply be poured with boiling water. Something to cook in a cauldron - pour the contents into boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. You have already understood that any vegetables, spices and meat undergo pre-drying in dehydrators and are mixed depending on the recipe in different proportions. In the process of drying, vegetables lose 90 percent of their mass. Due to moisture. ""Now I have 24 kg of carrots and beets in three dryers at home,"" says Maria. - Of all this goodness, 3 - 3.5 kg of dry product will remain. Sponsored volunteers bring Maria home farm vegetables in bags. On average, 15 - 20 kilograms of carrots, beets, etc. Then other participants of the project come to Maria. In total, 30 dryers participate in it. They disassemble vegetables at home, and there they thoroughly wash, peel, grate on a large grater. Someone with their hands, someone on food processors. However, before the borscht gets into the bag in dry form, it goes a long way. Everything for borsch and other soups is heat treated, and then dried. But it all depends on the specific products (see ""Recipes of Masha's mother""). When the sublimate is dried and accumulated enough, Maria and her assistants pack it in bags. The volumes are different, but the calculation of one serving is approximately as follows: 1 tablespoon of potatoes, 1 tablespoon of carrots, slightly less than dried onions, 2 tablespoons of cabbage, 1.5 tablespoons of beets, 2 teaspoons of tomato powder (dry tomatoes, then grind them with a blender). The shelf life of such a soup in a vacuum package is about six months. But provided that everything is dried to a crunch. In just two months, more than 5,000 servings were sent to the front lines. The demand for dry soups and cereals was great. Orders come from everywhere. But the possibilities of the Crimean factory ""Borshchevichka"" (as the project was nicknamed in the network) are not unlimited. The cooking time of 500 servings is about a day - from 20 to 24 hours. Additional costs - water and electricity. Mary receives decent bills. For November, for example, they counted 10 thousand for electricity and 5 thousand rubles for water. As a result, the cost of one portion of borsch, taking into account electricity, water and the cost of vegetables and meat, is 65 rubles. The rest of the soups come out a little cheaper. For industrial production, you need a room with a good hood so that moisture from vegetables does not settle on the ceiling and walls during drying. Secondly, good equipment, not household dryers. But the volunteer initiative has every chance to turn into a business that promises a good profit with a competent calculation. P.S. I asked Maria Varlamova for one bag of borscht meat to try. On a business trip to the hotel for dinner - this is what you need. I poured boiling water in a plate, let it brew for 10 minutes. During this time, a borscht aroma spilled throughout the room, looking like an ordinary homemade borscht. It tastes like it too. And most importantly - this is a piece of real home warmth and comfort. How to properly dry vegetables and meats. Carrots and beets. These vegetables are laid out on a greased pan or saucepan with vegetable oil and simmered for 15 minutes over low heat. When the vegetables are cooled, they are placed in dryers. Maria has two industrial dryers at home. One was given to her in an indefinite lease, the second was bought with the money collected by volunteers. In them, vegetables lie for 6 - 8 hours. In household appliances, the process stretches up to 10 hours. The result is a sweet, spicy sublimate. Cabbage. Cabbage is cut quite coarsely by hand, strips about a centimeter. Shredding is too fine. Then the cabbage is sprinkled with salt a little, everything is gently mixed. After that, you need to put the cabbage in the microwave for 5 to 7 minutes. It can give juice – put it in a colander to make the glass moisture. After - in the dryer for 6 - 10 hours. Potatoes. Potatoes need to be grated (or cut into straws, if the soup needs to be cooked in a cauldron), and then boiled in boiling water until ready. Salt. Then rinse with cold water and put in dryers for 6 to 8 hours. Meats. The first spos. The most delicious is smoked dried meat for pea soup. First, it is kept for 2 to 3 days in a special marinade (water with sugar, salt and spices). Then they cut into pieces and smoke for 8 hours. When the meat cools, it is cut into cubes and placed in dryers for 8 to 10 hours. The second spos. Low-fat pork, beef, chicken or turkey is twisted in a meat grinder with a large net. Then fry in a frying pan with oil and spices until ready for 15 - 20 minutes. Salt at the last moment. After another 5 minutes of roasting. Pour into a bowl in a thin layer, cool and send to dry. It is necessary to dry to the state of sawdust. When poured with boiling water, dried lumps swell and give the aroma of meat. The third spos. Pork carbonate must be cleaned of films and fat. Boil for 15 minutes. Pull it out, dry it. Wrap in foil and bake for 1.5 hours in the oven. Then completely cool, unwind the foil, remove the fat, which accumulates as jelly. Cut into pieces 3 - 3.5 cm wide, disassemble into fibers and send to drying. This type of meat perfectly soaks sweat in boiling water. LISTEN AS WELL. How has 2022 changed the global economy?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702069/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-03,Germany is not against giving frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. But can't find them,Berlin itself will not take such a risky step alone.,"On Tuesday afternoon, Ukraine recovered from optimistic news from Germany. World-famous for its competence and awareness of various cases, Bloomberg reported, citing its own sources, that the German authorities decided to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Recall that we are talking about about 300 billion dollars (according to another version - euros), which were frozen in the West after Moscow launched a special military operation in Ukraine. Since then, both in the West itself, and, even more so, in Ukraine, and hot summer days, and dank autumn evenings, and even cold winter nights, they do not cease to warm themselves with the thought of how they will use these hundreds of billions when they manage to put a paw on them. True, so far no one has yet given an answer where this money is and in what form it exists. Such ""leaks"" have happened more than once before, and there has not yet been a single one that has not been refuted within a few hours. The current case was no exception. Just a few hours later, the frenzied joy in Kiev over the iconic ""peremoga"" was replaced by a dull statement of another ""zrada"". As it turned out, the German government really supports the idea of using Russia's frozen assets for Ukraine, but is ready for such steps under ""only"" two conditions. First, if at the same time, or even better, germany's allies from among the EU countries take similar steps earlier. And the second is if they find ""legal grounds"" and a legal justification for the ""confiscation"" of Russia's money. And so, yes, all is well, beautiful Marquise. There are only a few ""little things"" like a bewitched mare, a burned stable and a marquis who shot himself because of the ruin. At the same time, even in the German government there are disagreements on this issue. For example, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok insists that European countries should ""confiscate"" at least part of the frozen assets. But the Minister of Finance of the German government, Christian Lindner, believes that no caution will be superfluous here. Quite understandable differences in positions, because ""in Europe"", as in ""ceEurope"", foreign ministers are distinguished neither by responsibility for their words, nor by education, nor by professionalism. But in the Ministry of Finance there are completely different people who are accustomed to dealing with ""subtle matter"" that loves ""silence"", and the same Lindner is well aware that the confiscation of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia will create a dangerous precedent, and, in addition to legal problems, will also cause an outflow of capital from the European market. There is no trust due to decision-making in favor of political ambitions – there will be no money. - The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz supports Ukraine's demand for military reparations, but has not yet taken an official position on the confiscation of assets from the Russian state. The issue is complex, and some parts of the ruling coalition are more active than others, people familiar with the discussions say, Bloomberg clarified the situation. You guys are more careful with your words. Especially with ""reparations"". After all, they are paid by the losing side. And no matter how some people had to pay them together with Ukraine, dividing them in a fraternal or fair way. If you really want to, you can be interrogated, like Ukraine, to which ""reparations"" fly with enviable regularity. There is one more nuance that Europe would not like to pay special attention to, but at the same time they are doing everything to ensure that this aspect always comes to the fore. It is simply terrible for them to act alone against Russia. They always want to push someone forward, so that it is on this ""first brave"" that Moscow's ""response"" falls. Gurtom and Batka beat with handballs, as they clearly told the Europeans in Kiev. They can confiscate it, maybe, if they find assets and justifications. But how will they return later and from what? Annalene will not take, and what more under the current authorities in the EU countries, and not only in Germany, may not remain in 15-20 years. LISTEN AS WELL.

At 00:01 on January 8, the temporary ceasefire introduced by Russia in part of Christmas ended. Our country declared it part of a great bright Orthodox holiday. In Kiev, they reacted as expected - spitting on a humane gesture. In the first minutes after the onset of the declared ""ceasefire regime"", the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck at the peaceful quarters of Donetsk. Ukrainian cannons rumbled further. The Russian Ministry of Defense later calculated: within a day and a half, ukrainian troops fired more than 160 large-caliber shells and 20 rockets of multiple launch rocket systems at residential areas of the city of Donetsk alone. ""The return fire of the Russian troops suppressed the Ukrainian artillery, from which the shelling of settlements was carried out,"" our military department said. Retaliate. ""In response to the criminal blow of the Kiev regime in the first minutes of January 2023, a retaliatory operation was carried out by the command of the Joint Group of Russian Forces on the point of temporary deployment of Russian servicemen in the village of Makiivka of the Donetsk People's Republic,"" said Igor Konashenkov, an official representative of the Ministry of Defense. Russian intelligence assets have uncovered and reliably confirmed through several independent channels the points of temporary deployment of military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city of Kramatorsk. Powerful strikes killed more than 600 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who had previously refused to observe the declared ceasefire along the entire line of combat contact. The founder of the Airborne Forces decided to overthrow him on the Dnieper. Boris Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro (Dnepropetrovsk), announced the imminent demolition of the monument to the founding father of the airborne troops, Vasyl Margelov. Filatov said that the monument will be offered to be taken away by those who served in the Airborne Forces under the USSR - it was on their initiative that the monument was installed in 2000, and it was created with the money of citizens and sponsors, and installed on the embankment of the Dnieper. It is worth recalling that Army General Vasily Margelov was born in Dnepropetrovsk (then Ekaterinoslav) in 1908. There is a monument to him in the center of Kherson, which he liberated from the Nazis in the Great Patriotic War. And the descendants of the underdogs will get to it. The gas pipeline in the LPR was blown up by agents of the independent country. The press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Lugansk People's Republic reported that the cause of the fire of the main gas pipeline in the city of Lutugino in the LPR, which occurred on the evening of January 7, according to preliminary information, was an explosion. According to available data, ""as a result of the explosion of the main gas pipeline at the air crossing over the Sukhaya River, 13,315 subscribers in 9 settlements remained without gas supply: Lutugino, Georgiyevka, Uspenka, Belorechensky, Lesnoye, Chelyuskinets, Vrubovsky, Lenina, Luxurious, as well as 21 socially significant objects."" These ""warriors of light"" can only at peaceful people. The Vatican prays for peace, but selectively. The Pope, in a traditional Sunday address in St. Peter's Square, called for prayers for peace and citizens. And also to remember in their prayers the Russian and Ukrainian mothers who lost their sons on the battlefield. Francis said: ""They lost their sons – this is the price of war, let's pray for these Russian and Ukrainian mothers."" But he focused on the suffering of the Ukrainian side, at the same time urging to think tirelessly about the children of the self. He said that it is necessary to live the holidays with sobriety and humility, and the saved money should be sent to the fund to help the affected Ukrainians. And you do not want to create a fund to help the affected children of Donbass. Will Berlin give tanks to Kiev? Bundestag Vice-Presidents Katrin Göring-Eckardt and Wolfgang Kubiki want West Germany to give independent tanks. Göring-Eckardt said it would be wrong to limit ourselves to Marder armoured vehicles: ""We must do and provide everything possible. This also applies to Leopard tanks."" Kubiki added that ""it is advisable to deliver not only Marder, but also Leopard tanks."" At the same time, he stressed that any further step to support Ukraine should be coordinated with NATO partners. Coordinate as much as you want, your tanks are not fast. The U.S. saw the Zaluzhnog crisis. Scott Ritter, a retired U.S. Marine Intelligence Officer, said that the requirements of the Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny on the supply of tanks and IFVs for the Armed Forces of Ukraine from NATO member countries indicate a critical shortage of military equipment in the Ukrainian army. According to the military leader, in order to return to the positions of February 23, he, the leader of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, needs 300 tanks, 600-700 BMPs, 500 howitzers. Ritter said. ""The Ukrainians burned most of their armored vehicles. Zaluzhny lost everything. He needs to rebuild his potential. APU move on lightly armored vehicles. Mostly on fortified SUVs. That's how they deliver their soldiers. This is not viable in the realities of today's mobile collisions."" With the onset of cold weather, Ritter believes, the Russian army gained another advantage over the enemy thanks to better technical equipment. No, well, they can't help but insert General Frost. Danilov is afraid of the ""Korean scenario. Alexei Danilov, secretary of the NSDC, said that Kiev was offered to resolve the situation according to the ""Korean scenario"". The secretary of the Ukrainian Security Council said: ""Here are such Ukrainians, and here are not such Ukrainians ... I know that one of the options that can be offered to us is the ""38th parallel"". Which divides the DPRK and South Korea. According to Danilov, representatives of Moscow at meetings with European politicians allegedly convey ""messages"" about their readiness to fix the status quo that has developed today. Well, actually, Kiev is now occupying part of the three new regions of Russia that became part of it following the September referendums. So, if the Korean scenario is possible, it is on a completely ""different parallel"". Podolyak ultimatly demands the extradition of Saakashvil. Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, said that he had a ""radical position"" on the topic of the ex-president of Georgia, a citizen of Ukraine, Mikhail Saakashvili, who is imprisoned in Tbilisi. Podolyak demanded his extradition to Kiev or export to ""any European country."" At the same time, Michiko is serving a six-year sentence for corruption and abuse of power from October 2021. Podolyak said that he was ""very sympathetic"" to Saakashvili, who illegally crossed the border of Georgia in a Ukrainian container with dairy products, and called the ex-president of the Transcaucasian republic ""a figure of historical proportions."" And he aggravated his attack by saying: ""The Georgian government deliberately wants to introduce its country into history as a state that purposefully tortured its president."" And this is said by a representative of the regime, with whose blessing prisoners of war and political prisoners are tortured in Ukraine. Shmygal claimed the world's largest minefield. The head of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers Denis Shmygal amazed the world with a statement that during the hostilities in Ukraine so many mines were laid that we can say about the creation of the largest minefield on Earth. It seems to be an area of 250,000 square kilometers – this is comparable to the area of South and North Korea. Shmygal said: ""At the moment it is the largest minefield in the world. It not only interferes with the movement of people, but also creates great problems for agriculture, and this is one of the main industries for us. "" At the same time, they are not averse to mastering the 15 million Canadian dollars allocated by Ottawa to Kiev for the supply of equipment for demining territories. And you will start with mine clearance of Odessa beaches and Mykolaiv lands. Although sea tourism for you is definitely not the main industry. LISTEN AS WELL.

Zelensky said that Moscow's proposal is ""a cover for the build-up of troops with the intention of continuing hostilities with renewed vigor."" And the Ukrainian side these days continued to hit not only the positions of Russian units, but also the civilian infrastructure of Donbass. In particular, from the barrel and rocket artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled peaceful objects in Donetsk, Horlivka and Makiivka. They also fired at Yelenivka and the Zuya TPP in Zugres. There, the Armed Forces of Ukraine sent a Tochka-U missile. But she was shot down (from the shrapnel the damage was minor). At night, after the strike from the MIRS ""Highmars"" on the Starobeshevskaya TPP in the village of Novy Svet, two women died and, according to the local administration, several more employees of the station, which was damaged, could be under the rubble. The armed forces of the Russian Federation observed the ceasefire until midnight, despite shelling by Ukrainian troops. And only after the completion of the virtually one-sided ceasefire regime, Russian troops attacked the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of one and a half dozen settlements. It was inherited from Russian artillerymen by units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region near the villages of Staritsa and Dvurechna. In the Lugansk People's Republic, the enemy was suppressed in the Kupyansk and Liman directions. And in the DPR in the Avdiivka direction, nationalist positions in Nevelskoye, Marinka and Novomikhailovka were beaten. In the Artyomovsk direction, the village of Podgornoye was taken and the movement towards Krasnaya Gora went. In Bakhmut (Artemovsk), Russian fighters fought on the south-eastern outskirts, as well as in the center of the village of Opytnoye and in the center of Soledar. There the enemy was forced to urgently transfer from the Zaporozhye direction the 46th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. When Soledar falls, the strategically (and psychologically) important Bakhmut will be able to press our forces from the north.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4703018/,Valentin ALFIMOV,2023-01-07,How do people in Ukraine really feel about Russia? And how can we change that?,"The people of Ukraine are divided. Some are waiting for the arrival of Russia, others - how everything will end, someone moved to Russia. Will we be able to live in peace and harmony? We talked about this on the air of Radio ""KP"" with the observer of the media group ""Russia Today"" Rostislav Ishchenko","DOSSIER ""KP. Political scientist Rostislav Ishchenko was born in Kyiv. In Kiev, he graduated from school and the Taras Shevchenko University. He worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the administration of the President of Ukraine. He represented Ukraine at the negotiations in the OSCE, as well as during the visits of delegations to different countries. He was an adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, and an adviser to the Minister of Education and Science. Since 2014, after the change of power in Kiev, he left, became a citizen of Russia. THEY RUN AND RETURN. - Rostislav Vladimirovich, you know perfectly well the people who stayed in Ukraine. What can you say about them. - Obviously, they have completely different moods. There are those who remained, and they were killed by patriots of Ukraine. And there are those who died at the front, fighting with Russia. There are those who stayed and wait for Russian troops to come, and even say: ""You would shoot more, God with him, but let the Russian troops come faster."" Their attitude, of course, is different. But the main thing is that it is constantly changing. - According to the latest official data, 41 million people lived in Ukraine. It's January 2022. - No one knows the exact figure. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that there were hardly more than 35 million. In Europe and in Russia, several million people lived and worked permanently. At the same time, Ukraine continued to consider them its citizens, those who had already essentially left Ukrainian citizenship. - And they left with the start of the special operation. - According to official data alone, there are over 11 million of them. In the first days. And then 5 million of them came back. There were other waves of emigration, and to Europe. And how many left unofficially. 40-YEAR-OLDS DID NOT KNOW ANY OTHER STATE. - What's with the mood of those who still stayed. - If we talk about the trend, then, unfortunately, the deterioration of the attitude towards Russia is monitored. This vector was set before the collapse of the USSR, in 1989, and continues now. And the further it goes, the stronger it intensifies. And it's not just because of the special operation. Those who are now 40 years old - they did not know another state. And that's up to half the population. And maybe more. Yes, the elders have always been more positive about Russia. Somewhere until the end of the 90s, the desire to restore a single state generally dominated. And then the older generation began to blur, along with this the nationalist tendency began to grow (it was even before the collapse of the USSR). - And those who are loyal to us come to us. - I won't say that everyone here is like that. I have repeatedly met people who say that they support Ukraine, or say: I do not care at all who wins there. But at the same time, they chose Russia for their place of residence, not Europe. At the same time, there are relatively few radically minded people in Ukraine who are really ready to kill -10-15 percent. - And everyone else is who. - The bulk are those who do not like Russia moderately, largely due to Ukrainian propaganda. But they are also dissatisfied with the Ukrainian regime, because ""tigers in a meat cage are not reported."" And when Russia comes, they also say: humanitarian aid is not like that, salaries are not the same, etc. YOU WILL HAVE TO BECOME RUSSIAN. - Does it make sense to talk to them, to drag them over to yourself? Or they're going to be that ticking time bomb. - There is a need. Obviously, over time, hostilities will continue, the number of territories that were Ukrainian, and became Russian, will increase. And the population in these territories will have to be re-forged. -How. - From my point of view, the only effective method is to work according to the same principle by which Ukrainian nationalists worked with post-Soviet generations. They spat on those who grew up under the Soviet Union and began to work with generations of schoolchildren - from the fourth or fifth grade. And these next generations, growing up, became their base. And they simply neutralized the older generation: they gradually abolished the Russian language, first seized, and then forged the Russian media. ""EUROPEANS. - Ukrainians who went abroad treat Russia. - There are people who simply left the war, there are people who left Russia. Of course, with the beginning of the special operation, emigration, which was firmly opposed to Russia, greatly increased. This is a politically active emigration, there are not so many of them, they just did not catch the eye before. Most of the emigration just sits and, frankly, they do not care deeply about what is happening there in Ukraine - they are trying to integrate into society. They just left for a better future. - That is, they plan to stay. -Of course. This trend has been going on since 2016. Then the number of Ukrainians who transport families increased dramatically - earlier only a young man or a man came and constantly went back and forth. Now these people want to become Poles, Swedes, Portuguese, etc. TO FORM AN ORDINARY RUSSIAN NARO. - Only during the special operation, according to official data, 2 million 800 thousand people came to Russia. A huge number. Plus another 2 or 3 million Ukrainians were also officially here. What do these people have hopes for? How they feel about Russia. - It is important to remember that Ukrainians did not appear in Russia yesterday or last February. Emigration began almost immediately in the 90s. Somewhere by 2010, about 4-5 million people had moved. - They are already Russians. -Think so. It was purely economic migration. Ukraine could not physically feed its population, and people went to Russia Cross-border ties were quite active. Somewhere in the early noughties there was a moment when Ukraine suddenly recorded almost transport paralysis in the border regional centers: drivers of trolleybuses, buses, trams left for Russia, because here they paid more. This is just one example, and there are many such examples. In addition, even before Putin's statement on the need for import substitution, entire strategic enterprises were bought and transported from Ukraine to Russia. With documentation, with equipment, with people. After 2014, active political migration began. Compared to the economic one, it is very small, but it is there. - Will we be able to come to an agreement with the Ukrainians and live in peace and harmony. - Once the Bolsheviks claimed that there were no fortresses that they could not take. If we set ourselves such a task and approach the matter without slogans, but pragmatically, then we will not negotiate - we need to develop the territory in such a way as it is simply beneficial to Russia. That is, from the local population to form a normal ordinary Russian people. Thank God, they speak Russian, half have Russian surnames, the other half are also Russian, only South Russian, which for some reason they consider Ukrainian. To explain to new generations that they are actually Russians, I don't think it's a super difficult task. We just need to work slowly, hard and consistently on this. LISTEN AS WELL.

Over the past day, the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out more than 377 artillery and mortar shelling of peaceful settlements and positions of Russian servicemen, only the streets of peaceful Donetsk were shelled with 180 shells of various calibers. The return fire of the Russian troops suppressed the Ukrainian artillery, from which the shelling of settlements was carried out. But that's not all. Konashenkov listed the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of contact: more than 30 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in the Kupyansk direction, more than 50 in Krasno-Limansky, up to 70 in Donetsk, more than 40 in South-Donetsk. Six sabotage groups, dozens of tanks, armored vehicles and pickups were also destroyed. During the day, strikes by operational-tactical and army aviation, missile troops and artillery hit: two warehouses of rocket and artillery weapons, as well as 84 artillery units in firing positions, manpower and military equipment in 117 districts. The representative of the Ministry of Defense thanked the fighter aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, whose aces shot down five aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force during the day. With the black soil of Donbass, the entire palette of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was mixed in a heap: Su-27, Su-24, Su-25 and MiG-29. The forces of air defense units destroyed 5 Ukrainian drones and 10 rockets of the HIMARS and Uragan multiple launch rocket systems, the American HARM anti-radar missile. By the way, on January 8, as a result of the negotiation process, 50 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled by the Kiev regime, who were in mortal danger in captivity. They were exchanged. ""By aircraft of the military transport aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, the released servicemen will be delivered to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation in medical institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Russia,"" the military department said. The Defense Ministry stressed that all those released ""are provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance."" BATTLE SUMMARY. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, they have been destroyed. 365 - aircraft. 199 - helicopters. 2848 - unmanned aerial vehicles. 400 - anti-aircraft missile systems. 7449 - tanks and other armored fighting vehicles. 972 - combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems. 3787 - field artillery and mortars. 7965 - units of special military vehicles.

Perhaps the main news in both Russia and Ukraine is the seizure of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. Now there are schismatics sitting there. The Ministry of Culture of Ukraine refused to extend the contract for the use of the Lavra to representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate and issued a permit to the PCUshniki to conduct services. And since the very morning of January 7, the Lavra was surrounded by people in uniform (more than three thousand people) and journalists (not so much, but also a lot). The temple itself was transferred almost to martial law, total shmon, document verification. The service was held for strong guys in camouflage and propagandists. And it all ended by itself with nationalist slogans. Today in Ukraine there is nowhere without it. There is such a journalistic cliché: ""an era is gone."" Many people used it today. We disagree. The era is gone. I stepped aside to return to my rightful place. And that will happen very soon. THE BEGINNING OF THE REVIVAL RUS. No less, it is the capture of almost the main temple of all Russian Orthodoxy that is called ... monks of the Svyatogorsk Lavra (one of the three on the territory of Ukraine). More precisely, they called it. When the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra was torn out of our hands, in one of the programs ""Besogon"" by Nikita Mikhalkov, a prophecy of the monks of the Svyatogorsk Lavra appeared. ""It says that the reunification of Russia will be exactly six months later, as soon as heretics and schismatics seize the Kiev-Pechersk and Pochayiv Lavras,"" the famous director said. This prophecy was passed on back in 2014! So if you believe the elders, already on July 7 we will see the very reunification of Russia. PERSECUTION OF THE FAITH. It was on Christmas Day that Zelensky suspended the citizenship of thirteen priests of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Yes. He did not impose sanctions, but literally took away his passport, expelled him from the country. Among them is Metropolitan Jonathan of Tulchin and Bratslav. Ukrainian media claim that this decision was made in the decree of December 28, but they raised it only now. According to the current rules in Ukraine, those mentioned in the decree can be deported from Ukraine. Where - not reported. ""And this is on Orthodox Christmas! Satanism as it is,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in her Telegram channel. ... AND CULTURES. It is not only priests who are persecuted. And also journalists, artists, athletes. Ukrainian as well. Zelensky also signed a decree on the imposition of sanctions against 119 people at once. In this list: Margarita Simonyan, Dmitry Kiselyov, Philip Kirkorov, Nikita Mikhalkov, Mikhail Shufutinsky, Irina Allegrova... as well as Ukrainian midfielder, ex-captain of the national football team Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, Lolita Milyavska, who also has a Ukrainian passport. Thus, Ukraine is the only country in the world that imposes sanctions against its own citizens. ""SUCH ASSISTANCE DESERVES RESPECT. All this mockery of faith and of one's people occurred on Christmas Day, January 7. To hurt harder. And in Russia, this Orthodox holiday was not without words about a special military operation. Vladimir Putin in his address to the Russians noted the contribution of the church to the special operation. This year was only the third time the president celebrated Christmas not in the regions, but in the capital's church. He attended a divine service in the Annunciation Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. The last time the Russian leader stayed in the capital more than 20 years ago - in 2000 he attended a service in the Church of the Trinity of the Life-Giving on the Sparrow Hills, and in 2001 - in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. ""With deep satisfaction, I would like to note the enormous creative contribution made by the Russian Orthodox Church and other Christian denominations of Russia to the unity of society, the preservation of our historical memory, the education of young people, and the strengthening of the institution of the family. Church organizations pay primary attention to maintaining interethnic and interreligious peace and harmony in our country, take care of those who need help, support our soldiers participating in a special military operation. Such a large, multifaceted, truly selfless work deserves the most sincere respect,"" Putin said in his address. He also wished all those celebrating Christmas ""success and all the best."" Patriarch Kirill, in turn, said that everything should be done so that Russians and Ukrainians do not become enemies. BATTLE FOR THE UNDERGROUND GORO. Businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin told why there are such stubborn and heavy battles for Artemovsk. - Bakhmut (until 2016 it was called Artemovsk) is the central point of the Eastern Front and a serious logistics center. And the enemy's task here is to try to destroy as many of our soldiers as possible,"" he said. He noted that the city has unique historical and geographical defense capabilities. And these are his ""chips"". - First, the division of the city into several parts by water barriers. Secondly, the vicinity of Bakhmut is a complex of settlements that create a unified defense system. Thirdly, it is a unique landscape, ravines and heights, which are natural tunnels,"" Prigozhin notes. But most importantly, these are still Soviet tunnels. - And the icing on the cake is the system of the Soledar and Bakhmut mines, actually a network of underground cities. In which there is not only a gathering of people at a depth of 80-100 meters, but also tanks and BMPs move. And the stocks of weapons have been stored since the First World War."" Russian fighters took the urban-type settlement of Novgorodskoye, fierce battles for which had been going on the day before. By the way, in the battles near Artemovsk, Ukrainian powerlifter Andriy Dmitriev was eliminated, this was stated by the Ukrainian Federation of this sport. And another of the leaders of the Ukrainian national bat ""Svoboda"" Oleksandr Polishchuk (Mountaineer). PEOPLE ARE BEING LOST LEFT AND DIRECTED. Are they crying or have they finally started telling the truth? Ambassador of Ukraine to the UK Vadym Prystaiko gave an amazing interview to Newsweek. He admitted that the Ukrainian army suffers ""incomprehensible"" losses. More precisely, they lose soldiers ""left and right"" (so I said). ""We are losing people left and right. We do not advertise how many of the dead are military or civilian, but you can imagine that the figures are huge, incomprehensible,"" Prystaiko said. I must say that they really do not talk about losses in Kiev. Information leaks through other channels. Thus, the American Colonel Douglas McGregor, in one of his statements, said that the Ukrainian troops lost about 100 thousand fighters. He also said that because of the terrible losses, Kiev has to send 15-year-old teenagers to the front line. UKRAINE IS ON THE BRINK OF DISASTERS. Meanwhile, even their masters in Washington say that Ukraine is on the verge of a disastrous situation. This was stated on the website of the American edition of the Washington Post by former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. According to them, both the military potential and the economy are already so dependent on the United States and its allies that without them it can no longer do anything. And of course they said that even more weapons were needed. ""The country's economy is in decline, millions of residents have fled, infrastructure is collapsing, and much of its mineral wealth, industrial potential and agricultural land are under Russian control,"" they said. But at the very beginning of the month, the chairman of the opposition German party ""Alternative for Germany"" Alice Weidel said that the supply of weapons to Kiev fuels the Ukrainian conflict, and most of the Germans do not support this."

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Politics is a rotten egg,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who has not lost a single battle. And he also repeated his famous words: ""Polite is also an executioner."" TOOK THE COLUMN OUT OF THE SHELLING. Major Eugene SAPRONO. ""Major Yevgeny Sapronov, together with his subordinates, carried out a combat mission to escort and protect a column of Russian troops, which carried out the transfer of units to one of the tactical directions. On its way to the designated area, the convoy came under heavy artillery fire from Ukrainian nationalists. Quickly orienting himself in the situation and assessing the terrain, Major Sapronov found the safest route for the movement of the column. Having given instructions to his subordinates, Eugene promptly redirected the convoy to another route. Thanks to the competent and coordinated actions of Major Sapronov and his subordinate personnel, it was possible to withdraw the military column from under fire, as well as to save the lives and health of servicemen and prevent losses in equipment. FOR TWO DAYS HE HELD THE POSITION. Senior sailor Egor NIKITI. ""Senior sailor Yegor Nikitin, as part of the unit, carried out a combat mission to open enemy positions in a given area. Moving through the terrain, a group of Russian servicemen, as part of which Yegor acted, managed to uncover the enemy's impending counteroffensive on the settlement in which the defensive positions of the Russian troops were organized. The enemy noticed the movement of a unit of Russian servicemen and opened heavy fire on them, as a result of which the commander of the unit was wounded. Yegor quickly orientated himself in the situation and rushed to provide first aid to the commander. Having given him first aid, he handed it over to his comrades for evacuation, and he himself covered the withdrawal of the unit to defensive positions. With accurate small arms fire, senior sailor Nikitin killed 5 nationalists. Having reached the village, Yegor, together with his comrades-in-arms, took up positions and prepared to repel the enemy's counteroffensive. For two days, the enemy made unsuccessful attempts to counterattack and dislodge russian troops from defensive positions. During the battle with superior enemy forces, senior sailor Yegor Nikitin destroyed a large number of nationalist manpower and knocked out two enemy infantry fighting vehicles, which did not allow the enemy to encircle a group of Russian servicemen and break through the defenses. Having suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment, the enemy fled the battlefield. Thanks to the courageous and selfless actions of Senior Sailor Nikitin, it was possible not only to save the lives of the commander and his comrades, but also to repel the enemy's offensive, as well as to create conditions for the further offensive of Russian troops and the occupation of more favorable lines and positions. "" THAT TIME. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and the holding company ""Russian Railways"" (JSC ""Russian Railways"") within the framework of the project ""We do not abandon our own"" organized an excursion tour to Kolomna near Moscow for participants in a special military operation (SVO) and members of their families. 150 servicemen, members of their families and family members of servicemen who died during the performance of the tasks of a special military operation visited the Kolomna Kremlin. During a one-day excursion, they took a walk along the battle course of its wall, learned about the exploits of the warriors, got acquainted with the armor and weapons of the warriors. And also visited a theatrical performance, during which they shot from a real bow and crossbow."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4703014/,Oleksandr BOYKO,2023-01-07,Zelensky boasted of a squad of Syrian terrorists in Bakhmut,"The Kiev regime does not hesitate to show links with bandits and international extremist groups, which it supplies with Western weapons.","The telegram channel of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed footage of armed mercenaries running around the sheds of Bakhmut, whom he calls members of the International Legion of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""Among the volunteers is the hero of the Ichkerian people Abdulhakim. Now the Chechen unit of the Legion is destroying the Russian occupiers in Bakhmut,"" the telegram channel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a statement. These shots are just a real gift to the fighters of the Chechen Republic, who have blood accounts with this terrorist (Abdulkhakim, he is also a native of the Chechen Republic Rustam Magomedovich Azhiyev or Ruslan Magomedovich Azhiyev has been on the international wanted list of terrorists and extremists for about 20 years). I recall the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who in 2015 said: ""In Syria, our Armed Forces are fighting, first of all, for Russia, defending the security of our citizens ... we must meet them and destroy them on the distant approaches."" Azhiyev is well known to our special services. And his fate is typical for all mercenaries. First, from 2000 to 2009, he killed civilians and Russian servicemen in non-existent Ichkeria under the command of international terrorist Rustam Basayev (Basayev liked to be treated in Ukraine until he was shot in 2007). Aliyev became a lieutenant in 2009: in a battle with our special forces, he injured his eye and shot three fingers on his left hand. The bandit fled through the gorges to Turkey, where he licked his wounds until 2013. After that, he went to Syria, where he joined the ranks of international terrorists under the nickname ""Abdulhakim Shishani"". In Syria, Ajiev's detachment declared its jamaat in the area of Latakia and Idlib. The bandits were engaged in kidnapping, racketeering, murder and sabotage. But in 2021, Russian troops pushed Azhiyev out of Syria for Turkey, where he continued the terror: he managed to commit several armed attacks on his countrymen with their families. In October 2022, there was information that Azhiyev appeared in Ukraine, where he was offered to command the same bandits and terrorists for good money. In general, by the age of 42, Azhiyev can only boast of the rank of colonel of the Armed Forces of Ichkeria. In general, such a typical colonel-terrorist of a number of non-existent states. By the way, Azhiyev has in Poland a younger brother-athlete Anzor, who is engaged in MMA. Aziyev himself was also engaged in sports since childhood: before leaving with the bandits in the forest at the Russian Championship in freestyle wrestling, he took 4th place. It remains to wish Anzor good luck in Polish MMA, and the returned Rustam to rest on Russian soil."

She fought with Agusha yogurt, justified the murder of Elderberry, supported the murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov. But even for the ""post-revolutionary Ukraine"" she proved too odious as a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and she was sent back to Lviv, where she carries the unkind and momentary as a teacher of the local university of local youth. But, as it turned out, not only young people. It's hard to imagine, but this creature, at 58 years old looking like a full-fledged old woman-witch from Little Russian horror stories, has not only a daughter, but also a grandson. And this karga is engaged in the upbringing of this grandson in her free time from the ""fight against the Moskals"". Of course, in the appropriate spirit. - Why does my Dmytrok, a grandson who is 3.5 years old, entering kindergarten, see in front of him some Grisha, who says to him: ""Hello"". And my grandson should teach him with his little fist the Ukrainian language. Because the child comes home nervously and says, ""Grandma, there's a Moskal in kindergarten."" And the grandmother says that the Moskal needs to be destroyed, and Dmytroik destroys the Moskal, - she opened up on the air of the Lviv TV channel NTA, where she was invited. - He puts it in the jaw, correct pronunciation. That is, all these parents who came here with their Muscovite children should understand that their child is not a child, that this is a child who should speak in a kindergarten, if it is a state or private kindergarten, should speak the state language, so that my child does not gain fleas of the Moscow language. A child is not a child, let him say ""Hello!"", but he does it not in the ""right"" language, but in the ""Moskvoroto"" language. Such a child must be destroyed. The essence of Farion's revelations, which she is proud of, which she voices publicly. And this is the quintessence of today's Ukrainianism, because thousands, tens of thousands of such crazy witches brought up and continue to educate their grandchildren and granddaughters before passing them on to ideologically verified and ""correct"" Nazi instructors from the camps of the Azov banned in Russia and similar terrorist organizations. Farion does not shy away from scandals. So, she feels no less proud of the fact that she prevented a customer in one of the Lviv stores from buying a cake, because she (apparently, an elderly intelligent woman) asked to sell her a cake in Russian language. - You can send in the direction of the ship immediately, if you hear the Moscow word. This, if we talk about everyday life, and we all go to the shops. I was buying tea today and watched as a lady, if you can call it a lady, with a stick came into the same store and said: ""Hello."" This is in the city of Lviv, and I realized that this ""liberator"" came. They haven't fully exhaled here yet,"" she shared another of her ""peremogs."" - And so, it came in and asked for a cake. She wants a cake. My sacred duty was to spoil her appetite and mood, and to send this old turnip, which I brought here, to Lviv, Putin... I stripped this granny liberator of that piece of cake today, I hope. She was shaking for a very long time after what I told her. No one insulted her, did not encroach on her any rights, it was she who pounced, like a beast prowling and growling at an ordinary grandmother, it is possible that she is ""God's dandelion"". And she is proud of the victory over those who cannot respond to her rudeness and misanthropy, over old women and kids. By the way, she ended her passage about Russian-speakers no less cynically, as well as what she said up to that moment. - If you don't like it, what's the problem? I sat on a tank with the letter Z and with the letter V, with my fetus and disappeared from here, - she concluded her story, how Dmytro humiliates and destroys Grisha. If she had the will, she would have shot all Russian-speakers, and babies would have begun to teach Russophobia in infancy. It is surprising that in the ""civilized West"" these speeches are pointedly overlooked. However, why be surprised if Europe is an ally of Ukraine, whose official authorities are doing what Farion says, only without further ado. But this freak, a former member of the CPSU, whose is written on her face in arshin letters, is a little unaware that tanks with the letters Z and V, as well as with the letter O, have not yet reached Lviv, where she teaches Ukrainian kids to kill Moskal. And when they get there, what will happen in the meantime, it will not be Grisha who will leave Lviv, but the old woman Farion herself will tear from there so that only her heels will sparkle. True, this most famous fan and fan of Stepan Bandera is unlikely to receive a warm welcome in Poland, and therefore her path lies much further. For example, in Chicago, where her sister Martha works in the mayor's office, according to some reports. However, for the latest revelations to Irina Farion, we can only say thank you. It once again convincingly and vividly showed what Ukraine has become under the current government, and why this country simply needs denazification from small to large.

Despite this, the Kiev regime continued active artillery shelling: in the Krasno-Limansky direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 4 mortar shelling of Russian positions was carried out, in the area of the village of Belogolovka of the Luhansk People's Republic - 3 artillery shelling, and from the area of the village of Novopavlovka in the Zaporozhye region there were 8 arrivals. Our Orthodox soldiers did not turn the ""second cheek"" to Catholics and pagans. ""With the return fire of the Russian troops, the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from which the shelling was carried out, were suppressed,"" said Igor Konashenkov, an official representative of the Ministry of Defense. Allied forces in the Donetsk People's Republic continue to storm the urban-type settlement of Novgorod, which was renamed New York by the Kiev authorities. Now the Nazis, who settled in New York, are actively hitting howitzers, rocket artillery and flamethrowers. While the artillery grinds the platoon strongpoints, the assault teams break into the trenches and dugouts. Aviation hits the vehicles with which the Armed Forces of Ukraine is trying to transfer ammunition and reserves to the front line Over the past day in New York, our soldiers have destroyed more than 200 Ukrainian nationalists and mercenaries. The French ambassador was summoned to the Polish Foreign Ministry after the words of French President Emmanuel Macron, who called Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki ""a far-right anti-Semite who excludes LGBT people."" Also the secret of Polichinel... As for LGBT people, a candle was not kept, but journalists often took pictures at the graves of Morawiecki's Bandera members with flowers. By the way, with Zelensky, like Macron and Duda, he never hugged at a meeting. Or maybe he's really an anti-Semite. The UN calculated how many Ukrainian refugees arrived in Europe - the number has already exceeded 7.9 million people. Among the leaders who received Ukrainians are Russia, Poland and Germany. At the same time, Russia has become the undisputed leader. Our country has received, warmed and employed more than 2.85 million refugees from Ukraine. But the neighbor - Poland - risked to take in only 1.5 million Ukrainians. And those are already beginning to be squeezed back into the Ukrainian army. ""Mutual Love"" has already reached the point that a group of Polish touring artists draws Zelensky on the asphalt of the central squares of the cities of Spain, Poland, in Berlin in the image of a large purulent pimple that is about to open. Zelensky's face with all his appearance calls to quickly squeeze himself out of the territory of Europe. Netizens examined in the hand of the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Kirill Budanov a German bayonet-knife to the rifle of the Mauser K-98 system of the Great Patriotic War. With this cheap example of the cold weapon of Hitler's soldier, Budanov decided to cut the cake in the form of a map of Russia for his birthday. Readers have noticed that if Budanov had a good military education, he would have known that Bayonets were forbidden to be sharpened by German soldiers, and they were stabbing weapons. And they also accused him of cheap parody of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who during his lifetime cut and distributed such a cake in the form of Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev commented on the refusal of the Kiev regime to join the Christmas truce in his telegram channel: ""Ukrainians were extended the hand of Christian mercy for the Great Holiday. Their leaders rejected it. I think most of our servicemen taking part in the SVO calmly exhaled when they heard the refusal of the main Ukrainian clowns to cease fire on Christmas Day. Less problems and disingenuousness."" Without accurate comparisons, too, could not do. Those who did not allow Orthodox Ukrainians to go to church, he called ""pigs that have no faith and an innate sense of gratitude"", their Western instructors ""swineherds"", German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok ""illiterate German grandmother"", and her colleagues ""looking at the European pigsty"" and ""heirs of the Nazis"".

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702785/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-06,It turned out ugly: Germany had to justify itself for the promised arms supplies to Ukraine,"The representative of the Cabinet of Ministers of Germany said that the promises of new arms supplies to Ukraine are ""not connected"" with putin's declared ""day of silence""","Oh, how uncomfortable it turned out! Since 2019, the U.S. has considered one Juan by the name of Guaido to be the legitimate and official president of Venezuela. And in every possible way promoted it in this status. But, alas, it never came together. And Joseph Biden, through his representative, announced that the United States no longer considers Guaido the president of Venezuela, and now he is just a simple Juan. And not even Don Pedro, who is from Brazil, because he is from Venezuela. A bird did not take off, not an eagle, but they fed selected American feed, money was sucked into it, albeit not so significant, by American standards. But the European Union 2 years ago, in January 2021, said that Guaido for Europe is a simple Juan. It seems that they put a faithful horse on the racetrack, they fed it themselves, they injected themselves, and it died after the first round. And resuscitation had no effect. By itself, Guaido is not interesting to us. Russia never considered it a nobody, unlike the West, which tried to inflate the bubble with weight and give it meaning. And the bubble burst. Somehow our ""sworn partners"" began to make mistakes more and more often. Which, frankly, inspires and in some places even amuses. Because they cannot quickly adjust their plans, and working along the already rolled rails they encounter preemptive opposition to Russia and begin to look ridiculous, despite all their formidability and swelling of the cheeks. Scholz then spoke with Biden on the phone and made reciprocal increased capitalist obligations to supply Ukraine with weapons. Biden said that the United States will supply Ukraine with a Bradley IFV. A really normal combat vehicle, it showed itself well in the sands of the Middle East and in the forest-steppes of Africa, called savannahs. Scholz in response promised to supply Ukraine not only with the Marder (""Marnitsa"") IFV, which zaluzhny, Reznikov and Zelensky in their erotic night dreams, but also with an additional battery of patriot air defense systems in addition to the promised American one. And then Macron, who spoke with Zelensky, who spoke with Zelensky a day earlier, promised Kiev to send heavy armored cars - ""tanks on wheels"". And London announced that it intends to arm Independence with heavy weapons from its arsenal. And all this would be nothing, especially in the eyes of the international world community. And it would look like nothing more, no less, but only help and solidarity with Ukraine. But just a few hours before the announcement of the results of their talks, Vladimir Putin announced the decision to unilaterally cease fire on the occasion of Christmas by Russian troops. Which all the above-mentioned persons, as well as a number of persons accompanying them, who the day before did not get tired of talking about the need to establish peace in Ukraine, declared hypocritical, not noteworthy, deceptive and many more not as it should be. And then there is such a dissonance – Putin not only announces a ceasefire, but also keeps this promise. Russia does not even hit infrastructure facilities with missiles, nor does it launch drones at substations. All of Russia's actions do not go beyond the line of contact and the near rear. And the West, which gave a tooth for peace in Ukraine, at this time voices its plans to supply dozens of units of heavy weapons. Oh, how awkward it turned out, yeah. Apparently, Berlin realized how they once again fell into the substance that the old ""grandpa Biden"" had amicably planted on them. Which can leave on the road such a ""surprise"" literally anywhere (and old age has nothing to do with it). And, clearly understanding the situation in which the German government did not fall at all, the representative of the Cabinet of Ministers of Germany Steffen Hebestreit tried to justify himself, saying that there was no connection between Berlin's decision to supply heavy weapons to Kiev and the statement from Russia about the ceasefire regime. ""There is no connection at all,"" he hurriedly replied to the briefing to the corresponding question of the journalist and tried to curtail the briefing as soon as possible. - Of course, we took note of the statement of the Russian side. There were various reactions to it from the German federal government, there were also reactions from international partners. Of course we believe. Willingly. Especially after the confessions of former Frau Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-President of France Francois Hollande, why they actually contributed to the conclusion of the Minsk agreements, and why they lied during those negotiations. Now we especially believe. And how can we believe it when the Germans, French, Americans, etc. begin to assure that their states are not a party to the conflict. To express this degree of faith, no language in the world has even invented words yet. Despite all the richness of the Russian language. You bet on the wrong horse, gentlemen. And Guaido's example doesn't seem to have taught you anything. It will die after the first lap, because it is not in the horse feed."

But, obviously, Ukrainian nationalists on the front line were not warned about this initiative by Moscow. ""Despite the observance of the ceasefire by the Russian group of troops on January 6 from 12.00 Moscow time, the Kiev regime continued artillery shelling of settlements and positions of Russian troops,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said at a briefing. The Lieutenant General noted that in the Krasno-Limansky direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 4 mortar shelling of Russian positions was carried out, in the area of the village of Belogolovka of the Lugansk People's Republic - 3 artillery shelling, and from the area of the village of Novopavlovka in the Zaporozhye region - 8 shelling. The Orthodox are not going to turn the ""second cheek"" under the fragments of Catholics and pagans. ""By the return fire of the Russian troops, the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from which the shelling was carried out, were suppressed,"" Konashenkov emphasized. The representative of the military department Igor Konashenkov also voiced the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past day: more than 40 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in the Kupyansk direction, more than 60 in Krasno-Limansky, up to 80 in Donetsk, more than 50 in South Donetsk. He specified that in the Krasno-Limansky direction, air strikes and artillery fire defeated two enemy assault groups, and also destroyed three sabotage and reconnaissance groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, operational-tactical aviation, missile troops and artillery of groups of troops (forces) of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were hit during the day: three warehouses of artillery ammunition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kherson region, the control point of the 95th airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Krasny Liman, radar stations of counter-battery warfare produced by the United States AN / TPQ-36 and AN / TPQ-50, the launcher and radar of the Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system S-300,  65 artillery units in firing positions, manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 102 districts. During the counter-battery struggle in the vicinity of the village of Pobeda in the Donetsk People's Republic, a D-20 howitzer was destroyed in a firing position, and in the area of Orekhov, Zaporozhye region, the M-777 artillery system produced by the United States was destroyed. The pilots of the fighter aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces contributed by shooting down the Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense fighters, who destroyed 5 drones and 8 American rockets of the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system. BATTLE SUMMARY. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, they have been destroyed. 360 - airplane. 199 - helicopter. 2839 - unmanned aerial vehicle. 400 - anti-aircraft missile systems. 7437 - tanks and other armored combat vehicles. 971 - combat vehicle of multiple launch rocket systems. 3783 - field artillery and mortar guns. 7951 - a unit of special military automobile equipment.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702691/,Victor BARANETS,2023-01-06,The ceasefire in Ukraine has entered into force: the whole truth about its true meaning and the brutal reaction of Ukraine,"Military observer Viktor Baranets explained what the ""ceasefire regime"" introduced by Russia in Ukraine means","On January 5, 2023, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia called for the establishment of a Christmas truce in Ukraine and Donbass ""so that Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and on the day of the Nativity of Christ."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, after the call of the Patriarch, instructed Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to introduce from 12.00 on January 6 to 24.00 on January 7 a ceasefire along the entire line of combat contact between the parties in Ukraine. At the same time, the Russian side appealed to Ukraine with an appeal to declare a ceasefire in a similar way and give believers the opportunity to attend services in churches on Christmas Eve, as well as on the Day of the Nativity of Christ. The appeal says: ""Proceeding from the fact that a large number of citizens professing Orthodoxy live in the areas of hostilities, we call on the Ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire."" The Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation issued an order according to which all our troops on the line of combat contact are obliged to ""cover the guns"" at the time designated by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The order was received at the headquarters of the commander of the special military operation, Army General Sergei Surovikin, and communicated to the personnel. This is a form of temporary suspension or cessation of hostilities in a certain area and at a certain time. If the conflicting parties comply with such conditions, then at the designated time hostilities cease, the selection of the wounded, the exchange of prisoners and killed, etc. Violation of the terms of the ceasefire is considered as a violation of the laws and customs of war. Yes, there were. During World War I, on December 24, 1914, an ""unofficial"" ceasefire was declared on the Western Front as France, Britain, and Germany celebrated Christmas. This lasted for the week leading up to Christmas. British and German troops exchanged greetings and songs while sitting in the trenches. German soldiers lit Christmas trees. There was a ""Ceasefire and Separation of Forces Agreement"" during the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict in May 1994. Many have already forgotten for sure that even during the beginning of the armed conflict in the Donbass (when Kiev began hostilities against the DPR and LPR), with the mediation of the Normandy Four and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, two ceasefire agreements were signed: the Minsk Protocol (2014) and the Second Minsk Agreement (2015). Ceasefire agreements were violated by the Ukrainian side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the proposal of Russian leader Vladimir Putin for a ceasefire in the zone of the special military operation (SVO) for the Christmas holidays. ""Now Russia wants to use Christmas as a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guys in the Donbas and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized closer to our positions,"" Zelensky said. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksiy Danilov said that the country does not intend to conduct any negotiations with Russia even on a temporary truce. Kiev really did not give a damn about Russia's humane gesture. Immediately after the onset of the declared time of ""silence"" in the Donbas, Ukrainian cannons thundered. The Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled Donetsk with artillery at exactly 12:00, the DPR representative office in the JCCC reported. ""The Kiev regime continued artillery shelling of settlements and positions of Russian troops, despite the ceasefire,"" the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed. This is, in fact, a slap in the face of Russia's humane gesture. Therefore, hopes that the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will allow themselves to observe the Christmas truce proposed by Russia are minimal. This will be prevented by the cruelty of the Ukrainian command, which allows itself to shoot those who do not obey orders. In addition, among the Ukrainian military there are a lot of Bandera members who are ready to open fire on people even on a holy holiday for many. The leadership of Ukraine during the holidays demonstrates absolute militaristic madness and tries to speculate on the problem, putting forward impossible conditions. But the Russian army is stronger than that. The Russian side acts in a highly humane manner, respecting the holiday, which is the main one for hundreds of millions of people not only in Russia. The hope for the sanity of Zelensky and his soldiers is more than illusory. Therefore, it is difficult to say to what extent the patience of Russian soldiers and officers will be enough not to open fire in response to the provocations of Ukrainian militants. If shells, bombs and missiles fall on our positions, the ""response"" will be inevitable. And this, as they say, will not be our choice. One of our priests said it well: ""A temporary ceasefire on Christmas Day does not mean that our soldiers will leave their combat positions and go to bed. If God gives even a few hours of silence, they will pray and glorify the Lord. If not, they will respond with merciless fire against Satanists, apostates from the Faith of their ancestors."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has endorsed the idea of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine on Christmas Day. This was stated by its official representative Stephane Dujarric. ""Christmas is a sacred period for Russians and Ukrainians. The possibility of observing the cessation of all hostilities for this sacred period is always welcomed by the Secretary General."" Judging by the votes in the media, by the posts in social networks, the absolute majority support the ""Christmas world"". These people are well aware that even a temporary ceasefire can save dozens, perhaps hundreds, of human lives. But there are, unfortunately, ""armchair experts"". Without understanding the essence of what is happening, they ignorantly confuse a temporary ceasefire with a truce. Although these are different things and Russia announced a temporary ceasefire.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4702695/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-06,The truth about the vile US plans for Russia revealed: They need a world without us,Columnist Alexander Grishin is sure that what has been announced in recent days in the United States leaves no doubt about American plans for our country.,"If the U.S. needs peace, it's not in Ukraine. However, this is not the main thing. The main thing is that for the United States in this world there should be no Russia. In its current form, within its current borders, with the current government, with its current people. This is evidenced by a number of seemingly unremarkable events that have happened in recent days, but combined into one row, they leave no doubt about the real purpose of American foreign policy. And in the falsity of any ""peaceful"" statements by the US State Department. The first is the attitude to the same ""truce"" proposed by Russia, although Putin did not offer any truce, but only ordered a unilateral ceasefire and offensive operations. Yes, it would seem only 36 hours, but anyone who really sought a peaceful resolution of the conflict would not only agree to it, but would also offer to extend its validity. As has already been said from some sources – before Epiphany, until some subsequent Orthodox holidays. Let's just say that it would be difficult for Moscow to abandon this third-party initiative. Since Russia positions itself as the guardian of Orthodox traditions, it is a sin to abandon the movement towards peace under the auspices of Orthodoxy. But nothing of the sort has been proposed. On the contrary, both Biden and the State Department immediately rejected this idea. ""The U.S. no longer has confidence in Russia's declared Christmas truce,"" a State Department spokesman said. And the question of trust was not initially raised. There was a question of a ceasefire. And then it would be time to agree and see who will comply with it. But the idea was initially accepted with hostility. The second is Biden's ""remarkable"" reaction to Moscow's proposal on the same issue. ""I am not eager to respond to any of what Putin has said,"" U.S. President Joseph Biden said in response to news of a Russian ceasefire. And it's not just about the Christmas Truce. It's about ""responding to any of what Putin said."" Regardless of whether we are talking about Ukraine, abortion or LGBT – the most pressing topics for the current American administration. And you can long mock the topic of the inadequacy of Grandfather Joseph, who a few hours ago said that the Patriot air defense system complexes have already shown themselves well in the Ukrainian theater of operations, although not a single launcher of this air defense system has yet arrived in Ukraine, and it remains to be seen when. Grandpa is inadequate, but his attitude toward the state called Russia is more stable than ever. And the cornerstone in it is the complete and any disregard for the proposals and initiatives of the head of state of the Russian Federation. And, finally, the third brick in the Russophobic wall of the United States is the appeal of the US Embassy in Russia to the Russian people. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev gave it a complete and destructive characterization, which it fully deserves: ""The State Department published a verbal appeal to the people of Russia, like we love all of you. It ends in their typical nasty Jesuit style: ""Stand in solidarity with each of you who seek to create a more peaceful future."" And the conflict in Ukraine, they say, is unworthy of everyone. Even for these first-class freaks, this is the height of cynicism and the limit of moral degradation."" But Mr Medvedev did not say anything else about one more point. That now for the United States, both the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran are placed on the same board. Despite all our differences, the share in world politics and the economy, Russia and Iran are united by one thing – the burning desire of the American administration to destroy these opponents, whom they consider existential enemies. Just to remind you, in October 2022, the deputy head of the press service of the US State Department, Vedant Patel, promised to continue supporting the Iranian people: ""The current US administration intends to continue to cooperate with allies and partners in taking steps to support the Iranian people."" At the same time, the State Department refused to work on the revival of the program on the Iranian nuclear program of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), saying that the JCPOA is dead, and the American authorities are not going to discuss anything with the Iranian authorities. They say that only the Iranian people matter. And just the day before yesterday, the official representative of the US State Department, Ned Price, repeated the same rhetoric, adding another aspect to it. ""At the head of our agenda is to do everything we can to support the universal rights of the people of Iran and counteract the growing security cooperation between Iran and Russia,"" Price announced, stressing again that the JCPOA is dead and the opinion of official Tehran does not matter to Washington. The ""dialogue with the people"" was again announced. And the next day, the US Embassy in Moscow announces the beginning of a dialogue with the ""Russian people"". That is, Washington's plans in our country are more than obvious. This is almost the same as publishing the official ""Manifesto on the Destruction of Russia"" in the media. And it is under this heading, because under other allegorical names this idea has long been dragged through in all sorts of ""scientific"" reports and analytical reviews. And we have no choice but to bring them to their senses and return them to an equal dialogue than to defeat them. At least in Ukraine. MORE ON THOSE. What does Russia's decision on a ceasefire mean and why is it not a truce with Ukraine? Putin invited the West and Ukraine to become people at least for a while, announcing a ceasefire from 12.00 on January 6. They unanimously refused this opportunity (details. LISTEN ALSO.

The DPR People's Militia stated that the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exceeded 170 people per day. Two tanks and four M777 howitzers were also destroyed. Pushilin's adviser said that Artemovsk will be liberated in the coming days. The Russian military shot down three Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft in the DPR. Russian air defense systems destroyed ten Ukrainian drones during the day. The Russian Armed Forces killed up to 50 militants in the Donetsk direction. Seven units of military equipment were also broken. The Russian military destroyed two American M777 systems and four Polish Krab installations. This was reported in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The Russian military liquidated two weapons depots of the Ukrainian army in the DPR and Zaporizhia region. In the Zaporozhye region, Ukrainian saboteurs were detained. The saboteurs were discovered by reconnaissance. Fighting is coming to an end in two strategically important cities in the Donbas: Soledar and Artemovsk (Bakhmut). The first of them has already been partially taken by Russian troops, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing to hand it over completely. This conclusion was reached by the war correspondent of ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" Alexander Kots. The Russian military told about the tank duel with the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbas.

The losses incurred by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in all directions reach from 500 to 1,000 people per day. I'm not talking about casualties, deserters - it's easy to multiply by the number of days a month, it turns out to be already 30 - 50 thousand per month. The CBO has been going on for more than a month, and I believe that the human potential in Ukraine is almost exhausted. - To fight Russia, you need to have a resource. - How will Ukraine continue to fight? My previous estimates were that by mid-autumn the professional army of Ukraine would run out. Despite all her ""successes"" seemingly with Raisins and in other areas, in fact it was very difficult. After that, another army almost ""left"" them. Now, on mobilization, they have gathered everyone they can. I admit that we managed to keep up to 15,000 professional soldiers in the second or third echelons. These are officers, and those who were able to retrain. But in any case, this is the loss of two or three mobilizations. - And how many people did they have before February 24. - If Ukraine entered into a conflict with the armed forces of 215 thousand people, then at least three times this value has been passed. There are estimates that speak in favor of a protracted conflict, huge losses and even ... victories of the Ukrainian army – the Ukrainian media write a lot about this. But where is this resource? Another month, well, two. It may be enough in some operational direction for some offensive. It will further exhaust this resource. - Offensive — where. - Suppose they threaten to dismember our front in the Melitopol direction. Let's say that it will be possible to concentrate 15-20 thousand people there and throw them on a breakthrough. They will be destroyed in the next 40-50 hours. And then what? The resource of man is not infinite. As well as the resource of ammunition, which is almost exhausted. Barrel artillery resource. The number of shots is limited. Conditionally, there are 1500 shots per barrel, and then it needs to be repaired. There is no repair base. - You can give a forecast about the timing of the special operation. - That's a tough story. I've been wrong, unfortunately, a couple of times already. I said that the Ukrainian army would be practically destroyed in October – and so it happened. But there was a second army, and in November a third army. -From where? Mobilizations and NATO mercenaries and weapons. - Both. NATO's total arms transfers account for 20 percent. Let the weapons be different, from different states, but still - these are high-precision weapons, effective. And few expected such a number of mercenaries. Cadre armed formations, I think, not only of Poland, but also of Romania, are already acting as mercenaries. Maybe other states. - How organized they are. - This force is quite organized. There are 10,000-12,000 mercenaries there. It is clear that with this number you will not win. In general, mercenaries will not win - there is neither interspecific interaction, nor the ability to large-scale operations. But their participation is intensifying in different directions. Therefore, I think that another resource will last a month and a half or two. - So, it turns out, until the end of March. - My prediction is that in two months there will be nothing to fight. And there's no one. - And then. - Then it's a political question. On what terms to negotiate? Whether it will be a capitulation, or it is a negotiation, in fact, some kind of compromise, or something else. - In the west, they say they can't lose. This means that NATO will enter into a confrontation. - To say is not to do. Scholz, Stoltenberg and their ilk have nothing to do with the armed forces, much less with the planning of military operations. They're irresponsible people, and they can say whatever they want. - What conclusions should our leadership draw after the strike on Makiivka? - My personal, subjective opinion is as follows. We need increased mobilization in all directions. Including from the point of view of the organization of the armed forces. Not everything is safe there in terms of supplying the armed forces. There are problems in the organisation of the defence industry. At the same time, fantastic efforts are being made in the defense industry. I'm thrilled with these people, who are very little talked about. Despite all the persecutions of the 90s, when 85% of the Russian defense industry was destroyed, they were able to do a lot. Now there is an accelerated process of restoring the capabilities of the military-industrial complex of Russia. - But this recovery did not begin yesterday. - This trend began to gain strength only in the autumn, for real. - Everyone cares about the result. - We do not have the opportunity to stop halfway and agree on some kind of compromise. But we cannot compromise with the West. We just have to defeat him by force. When an armed struggle begins, all political arguments must be pushed aside, they interfere. Their turn will come when the special operation is over. So we have no choice. - And what is the balance of power between Russia and NATO - we have the opportunity to win. - There is a wrong attitude to the analysis of the correlation of forces. When they try to compare GDP, military spending and this is simply extrapolated to the military power of the state. -It's not that. -No. Indeed, there is 15 times more GDP there, if we take the collective West. Military spending is 15 times greater. But that doesn't mean military power is 15 times greater. There is no direct relationship. Well, for example, the Almaz Antey concern will produce about one and a half to two times more air defense systems this year than the entire collective West. - And we have objective information about the enemy's weapons. - When they started a special operation with Ukraine, according to our estimates, they had 150 combat aircraft. Now we are talking about 350 downed aircraft. Where did those 200 extra come from? They had 60 air defense brigades there, only S-300 - they got it from the Soviet army. And how is it that we seem to have already destroyed not 60, but more than a hundred air defense brigades. Then tell me, how many of them are left?! It is necessary to talk about such things, otherwise doubts arise about the sincerity and accuracy of information. - When Finland and Sweden join NATO, will it affect the security of our country? - The border will increase by a thousand kilometers. In the Second World War, Germany and Finland closed our access to the Baltic in general. There were three or four mining lines across the Gulf of Finland. And our Baltic Fleet was inactive during the war. It could be the same now. - We wanted to push NATO aside, but in the end we moved it. - I met about two years ago with the former head of EU intelligence, by the way, a Finnish rear admiral. More than one and a half thousand bilateral and multilateral agreements between the United States and NATO have been concluded with Finland. Therefore, they were already there, in the alliance - Finland and Sweden. There are sort of two blocks. One narrow military-political bloc with strict obligations is NATO and 30 states. And about 30 other states are affiliated with this bloc in one way or another. This is the collective west. We are fighting with them. - Is it true that Poland is muddying the waters, and the rest of NATO does not want a conflict with Russia? And, if Kiev's forces run out by March, Warsaw will step in , because the West does not need to stop the conflict. - The most unpleasant situation may be a prolonged truce. There are many frozen conflicts in the world. There are about 30 states in the world, this is not only Cyprus, Transnistria, Karabakh. Many drag on for decades. And in Ukraine, there may be one such option. But it will not be profitable for us. LISTEN AS WELL. What to do with the cultural figures of Russia who betrayed our country?"

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4704243/,Alexander KOTS,2023-01-10,"""Meat grinder"" for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 300 kilometers of salt tunnels through which the tank will pass: What Russia gets along with the liberation of Soledar",Voenkor KP.RU Alexander Kots told about the battle for the city,"In the Donbas, the epic battle for Soledar has ended. The battle for another important city, Artemovsk (Bakhmut), is close to the end. What do we gain with Soledar's release? Special correspondent KP.RU Alexander Kots collected testimonies about the last hours of the battle for this city. ""It's very hard in Soledar right now. The situation there is more acute than in Bakhmut. The enemy attacks in small groups, usually up to 8 people, armed with riflemen, RPGs and ""Bumblebees"". Attacks on our positions are going on in ""waves"" - Ukrainian political scientist and officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Taras Berezovets sounds the alarm. ""This is not a complete encirclement, but the normal supply of ammunition along the route is impossible, it is critical for defense. The main threat from the Russians is the coverage of the city from the flanks. They will do everything possible to make their way to the track in the rear of Soledar,"" Echoes Ukrainian military journalist Yuriy Butusov. A sure sign that Kiev has come to the stage of accepting the inevitable - these two always appear where soon it will be necessary to turn the evil (loss in Ukrainian) into a peremog (victory in Ukrainian). It was the same before the abandonment of Severodonetsk by Ukrainian troops, and before our capture of Lysychansk. A few days before another sensitive defeat, Ukrainian propagandists usually begin to explain that this or that city did not have serious tactical significance. Therefore, it is better to leave it before you are completely surrounded. The Battle of Soledar, a small town of the DPR, has indeed reached its climax these days. PMC Wagner took its center, but the Ukrainian command continued to transfer reserves here. And from the Kherson region, and from the Svatov frontier in the LPR. For the Russian army, starved for serious successes, the capture of this city has both strategic and psychological significance. On the one hand, after a series of forced, but no less offensive regroupings, it is important to feel the taste of victory. Let it come at a high price. On the other hand, Soledar is actually the northern outskirts of the most important node of the Ukrainian defense - Artemovsk (Bakhmut), which turns out to be in pincers. Through Soledar also passes the line of defense to the north - to Seversk. From here there is a highway near Slavyansk. The Artyomovsk agglomeration is, in fact, a transport hub through which several military garrisons of Ukraine are supplied at once. And the destruction of this hub is one of the most important tasks on the way to the next line of the enemy's defense - the axis from Avdiivka to Slavyansk. The capture of Soledar, of course, will not be the turning point of the entire Winter Campaign of the special operation. But this is a notable success, in which the ""musicians"" (as the ""Wagnerians"" are called) show that it is possible to defeat the enemy even in conditions when he is literally underground. There are a lot of salt mines in the city. Their development began in the century before last. Surely everyone who lived in the USSR remembers a white and blue pack of salt ""Sil"" for 10 kopecks. Half of these packs for the whole huge country were mined here. 300 kilometers of underground communications - salt tunnels, on which, if desired, you can ride on KamAZ. Or on a tank. From the depleted mines, even a tourist object was created here, where you can drive a ball on a football field at a depth of 280 meters below sea level (we are talking about size, the grass does not grow here - the floor, walls and ceiling are all made of salt), listen to music in the concert hall and even improve your health in the underground sanatorium ""Salt Symphony"". They say that cool dry air, saturated with salts, has a good effect. Respiratory and skin diseases were treated here. An even more interesting object is located in the suburbs of Soledar, which is still held by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In Paraskoveevka, at the Volodarsky mine, at a depth of 152 meters below sea level, there are huge arsenals to which small arms were brought and preserved after the Great Patriotic War. In 2014, I was at the entrance of this mine. Then the unrest in the Donbass was just beginning. However, many already understood that there would be no ""velvet"" return to their native harbor according to the Crimean scenario. Local residents organized a round-the-clock picket near the mine, preventing the National Guard of Ukraine from exporting weapons for the needs of the ""Right Sector"" *. No one doubts its serviceability - a constant temperature regime and humidity levels in salt mines are ideal conditions for storage. And there are stored ""three-line"" Mosin, PPSh-41 and PPS-43 submachine guns, German MP-38/40 submachine guns, American Thomsons of the 1928 model, Mausers, Colts, Degtyarev and Maxim machine guns ... - Imagine the workings 17 meters wide and 50 meters high, blocked by metal gates. So one after another in one working there are several storages. The length of each is 150-200 meters. There are just huge ones, where 500 cars would fit in. In total, there are thousands of wagons with weapons,"" Vladimir Shanaev, former head of the 9th storage department of the Volodarsky mine, told me. According to him, it is almost impossible to undermine these workings, although it is possible to overwhelm the entrance. But armories, of course, were not the main target of the fighting. No matter how cynical it may sound, but now rubilovo is not so much even for the liberation of these cities. Soledar and Artemovsk (Bakhmut) have another important role, which has already been nicknamed the ""Bakhmut Meat Grinder"". Here, combat-ready units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which suffer large-scale losses, are grinded. Zelensky is deploying more and more forces to this front, weakening other directions and allowing the Russian army to prepare for combat operations in other parts of the Winter Campaign. And its main blows can be inflicted in completely different places. What. Hopefully we'll see soon. *Banned in Russia organization. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4703757/,Olga OSTROVSKAYA,2023-01-10,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on January 10, 2023: Russia's offensive pushes the key point of defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Chechen commander is waiting for success in Soledar","We have collected the latest news about what is happening around Ukraine on January 10, 2023","Russia is pressuring the key point of defense. The offensive of the Russian army continues in the key, Donetsk direction. This is reported by the Ministry of Defense. Fierce battles for control of strategic points continue around Artemovsk – aka Bakhmut. It is he who is a strategic point from where it is convenient to develop an offensive, cutting through the enemy's groupings and depriving him of supplies. Therefore, now the situation is slowly striving for a turning point. The Chechen commander awaits soledar's release. One of the keys to the occupation of Artemovsk is the release of Soledar. And, according to the Chechen commander Apta Alaudinov, soon the city may come under the control of our military. By the way - under Soledar, in the salt mines, there is another, underground city. In Soviet times, hundreds and thousands of wagons with weapons were brought here. And in the tunnels of the mines, even tanks can move freely. So it is difficult to overestimate the importance of intercepting a populated area. Alaudinov reports that the situation in this sector of the front is developing in such a way that the Armed Forces of Ukraine should think ""how they can withdraw at least the remnants of their forces and means."" Russian prisoners are tortured with electric shocks and a tooth is knocked out. Beatings, torture and executions became the norm of the Kiev regime during the interrogation of prisoners. The Investigative Committee of Russia after the next exchange recorded the facts of the inhuman attitude of the Ukrainian Nazis to the military. We are talking about methodical beatings, electric shocks, knocking out teeth. And this is not a complete list. Europe has traditionally continued to turn a blind eye to the monstrous and long-established violations of the Geneva Convention. In Hungary, the application for a truce was well received. Peter Szijjártó, the head of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference after a meeting with his counterpart Christoph Apala from the DRC that he considers Moscow's announcement of a Christmas truce in the fighting in the independent on January 6 and 7 to be the right decision. Szijjártó said: ""We want to see peace next door to us in Ukraine as soon as possible. We know that the path to peace is through ceasefires and peace talks. And we welcome anything that helps the ceasefire."" Interestingly, we also welcome this, but there are hearing problems in Kiev. Kiev admits that it gets a lot of old. Vadym Prystaiko, the independent ambassador to Britain, said that the Western weapons supplied to Kiev had mostly served their service life. In an interview with Newsweek, he noted that in Ukraine they are already joking that if someone wants to dispose of their weapons, they can transfer them to Kiev. Prystaiko opened up: ""In ordinary, peaceful times, no one would want to talk about it in such terms. But now, why not?"" I still had to shed a miserly male tear. In the independent recognized the effectiveness of Russian cyberattacks. Victor Zhora, deputy head of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine, who manages cybersecurity operations, said about the effectiveness of Russian cyber attacks on critical infrastructure facilities. As an example, he cited the attack on the energy company DTEK in July 2022. According to Zhora, then the Russian side launched a missile strike on the Kryvyi Rih CHPP and simultaneously attacked the corporate network. According to Zhora, a similar thing also happened in Odessa, Lviv and Mykolaiv. The deputy head of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine said that such attacks disable the work of data transmission services, IT infrastructure, power grids, telecommunications and critical infrastructure. And you hoped that you would be exhorted with a kind word. In the independent mining border with Belarus. The State Border Committee of Belarus reported that Kiev continues to work on mining the territory bordering with the republic. According to border guards, Ukrainians dig anti-tank ditches, put mine-explosive barriers, organize rubble. And this is done not by border guards, but by ""servicemen with different forms of clothing"", territorial defense units and unidentified military formations. The border committee of Belarus reported that the border is guarded in an enhanced mode, and ""border guards are ready to perform their tasks."" Well, the main thing is that neighbors do not massively begin to explode on their own mines and fall into their own ditches. And then accusing others of their own stupidity is a favorite trick of Zelensky's henchmen. In the West, they see the light - in Kiev there is an authoritarian regime. Ted Galen Carpenter, a columnist for The American Conservatory, believes that while the Western media fan the myth of self-styled democracy as a ""free democracy,"" the reality is that the regime is increasingly demonstrating authoritarian behavior. But, as the columnist notes, ""The Western cheerleaders of Ukraine are not ashamed at all. They continue to portray the country as a freedom-loving democracy, although evidence continues to accumulate that this is not the case."" Carpenter notes a number of decisions of the Kiev authorities that do not fit with the image of Zelensky. He writes: ""Genuine democracies do not ban opposition parties or shut down opposition media. They do not subject everything to strict censorship (and strict state control). He also cited other measures - non-compliance with legal procedures, the publication of ""black lists"" of domestic and foreign critics. This columnist has not yet been to Donbass... The Soviet transformers have run out, but the Western ones are not working. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukrenergo, said that there is an acute shortage of Soviet transformers in the country. He said: ""For the first eight months of the conflict, the country did not suffer as much as we had a large stock of transformers. Now they are desperately needed."" Especially acute is the shortage of devices with a voltage of 750 kV, their weight reaches 200 tons. The Ukrainian grid uses an old Soviet circuit operating at a higher voltage than EU systems. And it is incompatible with Western equipment. Well, then what will you do with European supplies. LISTEN AS WELL. What to do with the cultural figures of Russia who betrayed our country?"

Including some insignificant pieces of shit, who until recently considered themselves to be part of the so-called intellectual elite. I have recently spoken out on this topic. Well, then there was a harsh conversation between the bosses, how to act: ""according to the law"" or ""fairly"". I'll have to clarify. Of course, only by law. But if the law does not work or does not achieve the goal, then according to the special rules of wartime. Let us recall the experience of the Great Patriotic War and other countries. In times of war, there have always been such special rules. And quiet groups of impeccably inconspicuous people, effectively performing them."" ""Of course according to the Law. So far, the State Duma has not adopted wartime laws and they have not been signed by the President - only according to the Constitution and the Law, ""Andrei Klishas, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building, replied to Medvedev. The application for Smolyaninov was eventually submitted to the Investigative Committee of Russia by State Duma deputy Sultan Khamzaev. He said that ""after his statements, Smolyaninov should repeat the path of blogger Alexander Nevzorov, who was recognized as a foreign agent and put on trial for discrediting the Armed Forces of Russia."" About the artist Smolyaninov, the famous film director Ivan Okhlobystin, who often visits the Donbass and distinguished himself with his help to its residents and servicemen participating in a special military operation, also spoke. He said that the artists Roman Kachanov and Alexei Panin who fled abroad ""sneeze"" him for his ""conservative views and support for the authorities."" ""Okay Roma, godson Arturchik Smolyaninov advises me to go on trial. And also doubts my mental health. He also escaped. Now he admires European culture and is wildly sad about the fate of the Fatherland he left behind. But he was such a cool boy. Hard worker, romantic! I baptize him under the name Longinus. There was such a holy warrior. A Roman centurion who pierced Christ with a spear. Delivered from the torment of the Savior. Very beautiful image. I don't dislike them. I should, but I don't. I'm really crazy."" It seems that our artists have become real hostages of their real estate and currency accounts abroad. And this once again suggests that it is necessary to live here and now, and not to count on the favor of the Western elite and special services, who, using this way, will still throw the spent material into the dustbin of history. After all, traitors are not loved anywhere. Latvians have already begun to make fun of Smolyaninov. After all, for them, he is still a Moskal. Riga activists of the Stand with Ukraine movement (for Ukraine) handed Smolyaninov a summons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Which is logical after he expressed a desire to serve on the side of the Kiev authorities. But the actor refused to take a subpoena from the hands of activists, and then completely ran away from them. But not out of notoriety: TV presenter Otar Kushanashvili said that ""only a bastard can say such words about his own country."" LISTEN AS WELL.

It was obvious that people had not only become unaccustomed to human treatment in the POW camp, but had forgotten how to smile.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4703168/,Elena AFONINA,2023-01-08,Why Russia Actually Declared a Ceasefire: Important Answers Given,Political analyst Koshkin explained the meaning of Russia's introduction of a ceasefire regime for Christmas,"On the eve of Christmas, the Russian president announced a ceasefire in the CVO zone during the holiday and preparations for it. From 12.00 on January 6 to 24.00 hours on January 7. The Kiev regime responded with fire on the peaceful objects of Donbass. On Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda, we talked about this with the expert of the Association of Military Political Scientists, Head of the Department of Political Science and Sociology of the Russian University of Economics Andrei Koshkin. - The ceasefire declared by Russia in the SVO zone in honor of Christmas was the most discussed topic. And whether it was necessary to go for it. - It was an important foreign policy decision. Both in the West and, to a certain extent, in Ukraine reacted ambiguously to it. Where, after all, many support the canonical Orthodox Church. This step was also aimed at Ukrainian society. But, yes, the decision is not an easy one. - And what role it played. - It was necessary to show the attitude of Russia again. To reaffirm that we are open, ready to negotiate, but taking into account the real conditions, and not what is offered to us in Washington or in Kiev. We are talking about real agreements that can be discussed in the context of today's events. - Kiev immediately replied that it refused to comply with anything. What is the benefit of the offer. - Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and US Secretary of Defense Gates expressed their point of view that time plays on Russia. And although they say that the army of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is brilliant, but in general, when it comes to building a geopolitical space (and the SVO is a point of application of forces in a situation of reorganization of the world), on a global scale, we are talking about the fact that Russia offers, in the opinion of such analysts, important decisions in Europe. Including, even in the format of CVO. - What is this about. - Once again - on the part of Moscow, this was a proposal that was of a political nature. From a military point of view, we were answered unilaterally: the shelling immediately began at noon, on January 6. They hit Donetsk. This was Zelensky's instruction. The President of Ukraine did not go to the extent of reacting positively, although it had an impact on Ukrainian society. For us, this is an important factor. - But did it become an information bomb for Kiev or for the West. - What is the collective West doing in the information space? Russia is blamed for everything. Its ""aggressive essence"" is emphasized. And here we unilaterally propose a truce. In a Christian way. Which was painfully perceived by the Kiev regime. And our step correctly characterizes the Russian position in Europe and in the world as a whole. - And the version of ""just give people silence"" is accepted by many. - Our Patriarch clearly defined why he came up with such a proposal to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. He recalled that there are many Orthodox Christians in the combat zone, on both sides, for whom Christmas is important. - So our position is clear, but what about the position of the rest of the world. - Any action can be thrown mud in the information space. This is an information concept put forward by the collective West together with Ukraine. Yes, any suggestions from our side will be perverted. But at the same time, only a third of the world's population takes an aggressive attitude towards Russia, and two-thirds are tolerant of Russia and its actions to protect their security. The whole world is not reduced to Kiev and European states. And our western borders require a clear definition. And we need to protect both our security and our dignity. Including, and such steps. IN THAT. The Armed Forces of Ukraine responded with brutal meanness to the ceasefire: ""This is what ukraine has benefited from. From noon on January 6 to 24.00 on January 7, on the instructions of the Russian president and the corresponding order of the Minister of Defense, our troops in the special operation zone observed the ceasefire regime along the entire front line.

This is another trip of yours now. - Yes, before the New Year we visited the guys, handed them equipment, New Year's gifts. - Tell us, how is the mood there? Because Solovyov praised primorye residents for their strong spirit, for their courage. This, among other things, is thanks to the Governor and your delegations, and you always support your own in the WWO zone?.. - You know, we have such a character in Primorye - persistent, firm. We live in the Far East and understand the tasks that the state faces today to combat Nazism, to eradicate it, so that this evil does not come to our land. That's the first thing. And the second thing is that there is a complete conviction and understanding that here, in the rear, people are doing everything possible to help our guys. This connection is inseparable, it is permanent. And, of course, when you come there, to the guys, to the SVO zone, you give gifts, property, equipment, which, among other things, were made by the hands of Primorye residents. For the people there, it's an additional incentive. These are just those news from home that help in battle. And our Primorye residents never left their positions, did not leave their positions, did not leave, did not abandon their comrades. And also, if we talk about the units that were formed or deployed in our country, and now defend the Motherland in the SVO zone, they are among the largest in terms of numbers. Units of the Pacific Fleet with all their guards brigades, the airborne brigade, the 5th Army, aviation and helicopter regiments are Primorye soldiers who today defend our independence and the right to be and be called Russians, fighting to ensure that the foot of a Nazi never set foot on our land. - Oleg Nikolaevich, I have known about the equipment that Primorye residents supply to the SVO zone for a long time, but I just understand that this information is not for everyone. But maybe it's time to uncover this mystery? What exactly do you put there. - What we do with their own hands is both students and volunteers. And, if specifically - this, among other things, spare parts for quadcopters. Someone sews overalls, warm clothes. Someone transfers their cars - yes, also to the SVO zone. Probably, there is no Primorye resident who would be indifferent to what is happening now in the Donbass, in the Kherson region, in Zaporozhye. Today, everyone, to the best of their ability, helps our fighters. - But it's also interesting - when you return from the front line, you meet with the relatives of those who fight there. - Well, it happens. You need to provide some help, maybe transfer something, a note or something else. I gather the wives of military personnel, I call someone... I tell you how their husbands are. It's a must. - And I can't help but ask - Solovyov told about your guys that many of those who were out of action due to injury or whose contract expired, or, for example, someone is sent on vacation - then return to the SVO zone again. That's about what percentage of contractors and volunteers go back to the special operation zone. - We have a lot of wounded returning to their units after recovery. There are, of course, castlings that allow our warriors-countrymen to come out of the front line, to put themselves in order, as they say - to recharge, rest and again - to the front line. - You have never met General Surovikin. - No, the general is a busy man, and due to the fact that he is also constantly on the road, it is very difficult to find a time for a meeting. And why distract. - And the final question, I guess. You, literally, almost from the first days of the special operation, are in the area of its conduct. - Since April. -Yes. Do you feel that some kind of turning point is coming - during a special operation? I've heard critical notes from you before, too. And now what is changing, in the SVO zone? And in our society. - Either way, the change is noticeable. Because there are a lot of families from which men went into the army - husbands, sons, close relatives. And everyone understands that now it is impossible to live like this: we still have a time of peace, and war is somewhere out there, far away. We are not saying that everyone must necessarily live a front-line life, but the rear must also work for the SVO. Both ideologically and economically. Therefore, people have such mutual understanding and involvement in everything that is happening in the country. And everyone empathizes. I believe that our society, as a whole, understands how important the unity of the nation is now. Both the Russian Defence Ministry and our industry are beginning to switch to such rails, when the situation in terms of security changes for the better. Much more needs to be done, but the work is underway, and new weapons and new complexes are coming. And a second line of defense has appeared, there are opportunities to build fortifications that are longer-term and more powerful. We see that tactics are changing and there is more meaningfulness in our actions. Don't just go ahead, go ahead. Although, more and more needs to be done - both society as a whole and the economy - in particular - in order to finally turn the tide of the special operation and achieve a peace agreement on our terms. - This is what you are telling me, relying, among other things, on the opinion of your guys who are fighting in the SVO zone. -Of course. Qualitative changes are visible - both in the command and control system of troops, and in the training of our soldiers. But there is still a lot of work ahead, a lot of things need to be done. - Thank you very much. And - good luck in the New Year. -Same here. LISTEN AS WELL.

His deputies were commander-in-chief of the Aerospace Forces Sergei Surovikin (who led the group for the past three months), commander-in-chief of the ground forces Oleg Salyukov and deputy chief of the General Staff Alexei Kim. Such appointments, according to the Ministry of Defense, are associated with the expansion of the tasks of a special military operation. Expansion and deepening. Rodion Mirochnik, the former ambassador of the LPR in Moscow, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost about 25,000 people in the battles for Soledar. Mirochnik said: ""Ukraine has paid a price incommensurate with reality for the 'political expediency' of preserving Soledar. For the retention of a city with a once ten thousand population, they put two and a half times as many soldiers."" Losses at Soledar, Mirochnik believes, ""will affect the further combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."" On the evening of January 11, well-known businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin reported that Soledar had been completely released by the Russian military. The American edition of The Drive reports that the pilots of the Ukrainian Air Force are afraid of the Russian rocket R-37M. Pilots admitted to American journalists that such an air-to-air missile threatens Ukrainian MiGs and Sushkas even when fired from Russian airspace. One of the pilots noted that in order to evade the R-37M, it is necessary to continuously maneuver. And then there is simply no question of performing a combat mission. The Drive quotes an Air Force pilot as saying, ""If you don't know about the launch of this missile, you're already dead."" It is worth recalling that the R-37M has a range of more than 300 kilometers and is used both from miG-31BM fighter-interceptors and from the Su-35S fighter. When dragons fly, sparrows hide. James Comer, a congressman from Kentucky, called Ukraine the opponents of the United States, along with Russia and China. Comer takes into account suspicions about the ties of the family of the US president with representatives of the Kiev regime. The congressman, speaking about ""opponents from Beijing, Moscow and Kiev,"" believes: ""Bad decisions made by Biden have a detrimental effect on every American, and you ask whether this president is compromised?"" Comer suspects that the supply of weapons to the Kiev regime by the United States is not transparent. And this harms, among other things, America itself. Yeah, not everything that's useful is in your mouth. Ukroboronprom has launched mass production of 82 mm mines in one of the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance (and everyone guesses which one). According to Ukrainian defense workers, the mine they improved is several times better than the current one. The number of fragments it has is 2 times greater than a standard mine should have. Also, the Ukrainian defense industry has established the production of artillery shells of 152 mm and 122 mm caliber. Hiroshi Ohara, an analyst at Shukan Gendai, believes that the Ukrainian conflict has become a battle ""to satisfy American ambitions."" And its outcome will be similar to the results of the Vietnam War. According to the Japanese observer, the difference between the two conflicts is that earlier the United States intervened in the Vietnam War, and the USSR, China, and other countries ""provided behind-the-scenes support to avoid nuclear war."" Now Russia has intervened directly, so the United States and Europe are providing indirect assistance. The Japanese expert believes that Russia is fighting not with Ukraine, but with NATO and the United States behind it. Ohara stressed that now the United States is weaker than in the days of Vietnam. Which can not but rejoice. Polish Prime Minister Andrzej Duda, Lithuanian Presidents Gitanas Nauseda and Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky met in Lviv to give Kiev another portion of unrealistic hopes. Polish TV channel Polsat reported: ""The leaders of the three countries discussed support for Kiev, in particular, military support. Poland became the first state that provided Ukraine with large-scale assistance."" They discussed the supply of heavy weapons, primarily Leopard tanks, as well as the topic of security of the northwestern part of the independent.

And then it's time to remember how he appeared at the head of the ""brain trust"" of the Armed Forces of Russia. Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov - from a family of hard workers. He took the first steps to the top of his military career as a boy - at the Kazan Suvorov School (graduated with honors). With a gold medal he graduated from the Kazan Tank Command School, and then (also with honors) from the Academy of Armored Forces. Then - and the Academy of the General Staff. He ""trampled"" all the stages of growth in command and staff positions in good faith (not jumping over the bluff anywhere, which is especially appreciated in the officer environment). He began as a ""leteha""-platoon, commanded a company, battalion, regiment, division, army (and, the most belligerent - the 58th combined arms in the North Caucasus, which fought in the Second Chechen Company). He was chief of staff of both the Far Eastern Military District and the North Caucasus. He commanded the Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. In 2010, he became Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In this position, he ""allowed"" himself to oppose the adventurous reforms of Defense Minister Serdyukov. And he paid the price. For his intractability, he was sent from Moscow again to command the Military District for the third time (!), this time to command the Central District. After Serdyukov's resignation, the new Defense Minister Shoigu presented Gerasimov's candidacy for the post of Chief of the General Staff to the president. Putin approved this proposal on November 9, 2012. Gerasimov was one of the developers of the special operation for the peaceful return of Crimea to Russia in 2014. ""Had a hand"" in the development of the current special operation in Ukraine. Although on August 5, 2015, the Military Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine declared Gerasimov ""the main ideologist of the war in the Donbas."" He was declared ""arrested in absentia"". The Russian Defense Ministry responded by saying that this was a political provocation, and the Security Service of Ukraine was a ""reserve of idiocy."" Gerasimov is a Hero of Russia and a holder of 9 Soviet and Russian orders. I have met and talked with the Chief of the General Staff many times. But only once did I persuade him in an interview with great difficulty. He explained his frequent refusals as follows: ""I need to manage the troops, and not give interviews.""

Kiev admits defeat. - The Kiev side will do everything to mix this. Yes, nothing is finished at Soledar yet. Yes, the Russian army actually occupies Soledar. But part of the Ukrainian army was able to retreat in a controlled manner. Our super task is to take the heights. Their understanding - it is very difficult to take heights. - What would you pay special attention to in this operation. - The first is that the guys showed tremendous courage. Urban fighting is hell for everyone involved. It's such a physical and emotional intensity that God forbid. - So as for the further development of the situation. - I think the Russian army in the direction of Bakhmut will develop an offensive. The fact that we came from the north complicated the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And there, too, a situation may arise when you can try to take the enemy into an operational environment. - The head of the DPR Pushilin declares a turning point in the liberation of the republic ... - As for the DPR, the situation there will be greatly facilitated in terms of the alignment of forces and means. I understand Pushilin - he wants to give a positive message to the residents of the DPR. They are deathly tired of the war. If the situation continues to develop in a similar way, then the entire DPR will be under the control of the Russian army. But how will events develop further... The opening of lend-lease is ahead. And it's hard to predict anything. But I always bet on the Russian soldier I saw in battle. These are people who are able to crush everything in their path. - Clarify about Lend-Lease. - The point is that it will be a different nomenclature, to a large extent, offensive weapons. And then what happens? 11 Ukrainian crews have been trained for American F-16 aircraft. They weren't just cooked, weren't they? So, these aircraft will still be delivered? Perhaps they will be operated from military airfields in Poland. - That's possible. -It's possible. - We have to take some action. - Yes, and this is not only the supply of new air defense systems to the troops. There are a lot of other things that, with the beginning of lend-lease, should not come as a surprise to us. It is not only about the quantity, but also about the quality of weapons. - Zelensky's adviser Arestovich said that the capture of the destroyed Soledar will not benefit the Russians. - This person is in a state of great distress. Its task is to mitigate big troubles. But it is difficult for him to deny a fait accompli. - The importance of the transport hub is difficult to downplay. - Victory should not be too elevated to heaven, but it should not be minimized either.

What's next,"Units of the Ministry of Defense blocked Soledar from the North and South, the battles are going on within its limits","The battles for the city of Soledar in the DPR have reached a decisive stage. According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, airborne units blocked this settlement from the northern and southern directions. The VKS strikes at identified targets, and assault squads are fighting in the city. Fighters of the private military company Wagner are also fighting in Soledar. Its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that the city had practically come under the control of Russian troops. According to him, in the center of the city, the militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were in the cauldron, there is a battle. However, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov urged not to rush with assessments and said that the success of military operations will be achieved when the goals set by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief during the special operation are fulfilled. However, Dmitry Peskov agreed that tactical successes are also very important. ""They come at the cost of the fantastic heroism of our fighters,"" the presidential spokesman said. - Therefore, this is another reason for pride in those of our guys who do not regret either their lives or their health on the spot. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to resist. However, as the main Ukrainian PR specialist Oleksiy Arestovich admitted, at some point the units defending Soledar flinched and ran. ""Now they are not fleeing, but there were unstable comrades who fled,"" he said on the air of one of the Youtube channels. They don't run because they retreat. On the eve of the evening it became known that Russian troops are shelling the Artemovsk-Soledar highway. This is the only way to supply the Ukrainian group in the city, with a shortage of ammunition, resistance becomes absolutely unpromising. And the resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, apparently, is an attempt not to hold the city, but to cover the withdrawal. The battles for Soledar became a real hell for the Ukrainian army. On the eve of the well-known military commander Alexander Sladkov said on the radio ""Moscow Speaks"" that the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer huge losses: the enemy loses personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles. On the eve of the evening, Ukrainian telegram channels, citing sources, reported that the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny reported to Zelensky about the ""critical situation"" in Soledar and insisted on the withdrawal of Ukrainian units from the city. Against the backdrop of the victorious statements that Kiev regularly feeds to the West, this was a difficult decision. However, the threat of encirclement threatened a real catastrophe, it was necessary to choose the lesser of two evils. Moreover, in Ukraine, the situation in this direction caused increasing discontent: regular posts of Ukrainian soldiers appeared in social networks that the command abandoned them in the Soledar meat grinder to the mercy of fate. As stated by the acting head of the DPR Denis Pushilin, after the release of Soledar, good prospects will open up for the liberation of Artemovsk. And the cleaning of Artemovsk, in turn, will mean hacking, probably, one of the most powerful lines of defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the DPR. For Russian troops, a direct route will open to Kramatorsk, Slavyansk - cities that can be called the key to the liberation of the entire territory of the DPR. READ ALSO.

They are gradually clearing the city of the remnants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to some reports, up to 1,000 soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can hide underground in the city. They had already begun to surrender. Resistance is provided by detachments of mercenaries, whom no one wants to take prisoner. Among them there are many Poles who quarrel among themselves and demand help already through open communication. This is a sign that things are very bad for them, but no one will come to their aid. At this time, air strikes, missile troops and artillery in the area of the city of Artemovsk of the Donetsk People's Republic eliminated: 4 sabotage groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the command and observation post of the battalion of the 57th motorized infantry brigade, hit 74 artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, dozens of tanks, armored vehicles, pickups in 113 districts.

It is felt that, having believed in the stories of the Kiev PR specialist Arestovich, the majority refuses to believe in the loss of the city. However, indirect evidence of the failures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can be found in the groups of Artemovsk (Ukrainians call him Bakhmut) and Soledar: recently the number of requests for help to find servicemen has increased significantly. Most of the missing served in the 46th Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, whose positions were in Soledar. ""Attention to all those who are not indifferent!!! I ask you to report who knows at least something about the soldier of the 46th separate airborne assault brigade of the 2nd battalion of the 5th company Starchenko Vladislav Ivanovich 1989 My last time I was in touch on December 19, 2022 in the bakhmut area, ""- there were a lot of such appeals.

Residents are offered for a similar price to go by minibus to Warsaw, Berlin, Brussels, Zurich - in general, anywhere. There is also a free evacuation to Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev and other cities. People are offered warm shelters, where you can settle even with pets. It is noteworthy that there is no demand for evacuation. Journalists from Artemovsk talked with the city administration and volunteer centers and found out that there were no people willing to go deep into Ukraine either in Soledar or in Artemovsk. At the same time, it is known for sure that in Soledar, where there are battles, there are many civilians left. ""We are no longer riding in vain,"" said the head of one of the volunteer centers. - How many times have you happened, you come, you try to persuade people, and they send you.

Those who are now trying to downplay the scale of the success in Soledar, comparing it with the losses of territories in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions, are disingenuous, to put it mildly. Yes, in terms of area, this is a disproportionate scale. But Kherson, Izyum, and Kupyansk were left virtually without exhausting positional battles. So, without catastrophic losses on our part. In Soledar, for six months, combat-ready units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were grinded. Kiev threw more and more brigades to hold the city, which left the combat zone in the bodies of pickup trucks and black bags. Yes, Soledar is a small town on the outskirts of the most powerful node of Ukrainian defense - Artemovsk.

Despite the fact that most of them were in a state of strong alcoholic intoxication. Four out of every ten hospitalized have been diagnosed with severe frostbite.

In Bulgaria, the country's Constitutional Court will check for compliance with the basic law of the state the decision of the parliament on the provision of military-technical assistance to independent. This is the reaction to the request of fifty deputies who were outraged that Sofia would supply Kiev with a lot of weapons. Socialist deputies and representatives of the Revival party addressed the Constitutional Court with a request. Polls show that the Bulgarian population is increasingly agreeing with the Russian vision of the conflict in Ukraine. But the Bulgarian parliament had previously regularly rubber-stamped decisions on the supply of cannons and shells to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. But winter came - a little bit of intelligence brought. The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance admitted that Kiev in 2023 will have to pay $ 17.9 billion of public debts. And this is more than 658 billion hryvnias. At the same time, three-quarters of this amount will be used to service and repay the domestic public debt. And $ 3.3 billion will be thrown into servicing and repayment of the external public debt. The peak of payments will fall on May. Large payments are planned for June and November. And the maximum volume of Ukraine's public debt has long exceeded the projected level of GDP for this year. And Kiev admits that the country needs $4-5 billion in Western aid every month. After all, otherwise millions of state employees and pensioners will be left without salaries and pensions. They will put you in jail and you don't steal. Paris and Warsaw are pushing Berlin to provide Kiev with Leopard tanks. Polistico, citing informed sources, claims that France is putting pressure on Germany in the hope of getting an agreement from him to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. And all this on the eve of the Franco-German summit on January 22. Similar signals come from Poland. It craves a broad coalition among Western partners. To jointly transfer leopard tanks to independent. And behind them will pull up French and British armored vehicles. But they all burn equally well. The Armed Forces of Ukraine again shelled the Belgorod city of Shebekino. Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said: ""Destruction was recorded in 12 private households and two cars."" The head of the region said that the power transmission tower was also damaged. Two days earlier, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were harassing the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka in the Shebekinsky urban district. It borders with Kharkiv region. Since the beginning of the SVO, Belgorod region has been subjected to shelling constantly. The region has had a yellow level of terrorist danger since the spring of 2022. The other day it was extended until January 20. But neighbors have their own schedule of menstruation.

The columnist of the Turkish dikGAZETE Erhan Altiparmak believes that Zelensky this year faces confrontation with Ukrainian oligarchs. In his opinion, after the start of the Russian special operation in the independent country, a period of political uncertainty has come. And what did the Ukrainian leader do? Altyparmak believes: ""Being unable to make independent decisions, but only trying to maintain the sympathy won in the world through agitation, as well as looking into the mouth of the administrations of Western countries, Zelensky failed to gain any experience in such a critical 2022 year."" He suggested that Arestovich's statements about the need to establish a monarchy in Ukraine were addressed to local oligarchs who lost billions of dollars and left the country. But they are unlikely to return while Bankova is making decisions on long-distance calls and close cocaine tracks. According to data from Lugansk, the Ukrainian military complain about the low technical readiness of Western-made equipment for winter conditions. The videos show that European armored vehicles were stupidly stuck to the Ukrainian icy arable land. And you can't even get into this armored vehicle - all the hatches are frozen and do not open. And you would have consulted the spirit of Napoleon before making deliveries. He would tell you about the berezina fiasco. And about how to avoid shame when fleeing from the Russians. Another illegal scheme of crossing the border of men fleeing from the conflict was revealed by the migration police of the Zhytomyr region. The chubby heroes fictitiously married single mothers in order to leave the country. For the registration of a fictitious marriage, women were offered $ 500.

Therefore, it is possible to determine the direction of movement of forces and means. One of the directions is Rostov-on-Don, Taganrog. Perhaps they want or wanted to seize these territories. The maps were found during a search of the premises in which the command posts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were located. They have already been studied by the special services and came to the conclusion that the marks were applied no later than July last year. Among the Ukrainian Nazis, the idea that the Rostov region, Kuban, Stavropol Territory should belong to Ukraine has long been popular. It turns out that these ideas have already turned into concrete plans. ""If we had given a slack in February, we could have faced direct military aggression in the Rostov region as well,"" military expert and historian Yuri Knutov said. - The south of Russia is a long-standing dream of Ukrainian Nazis, including in the power structures. As far as can be judged, the main plan was to change the government in Russia, weaken us and tear us to pieces. On the map of Budanov (head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine), Russia is allocated a very small territory. These are, of course, only plans. But if in February-March, attacking the Donbass, they would have succeeded, they would certainly have moved to the Rostov region with Taganrog. The beginning of the special operation disrupted these plans. LISTEN AS WELL. What to do with the cultural figures of Russia who betrayed our country?"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4704343/,Ivan PANKIN,2023-01-10,Military blogger Yuri Podolyaka: Soledar and Bakhmut are not a turning point. Russia is preparing its main offensive elsewhere,"The battle for these two cities of Donbass is only a diversionary maneuver - this opinion was expressed by a well-known military blogger on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda""","""KP"". - The city of Artemovsk, aka Bakhmut, we successfully storm. Soledar was almost released. Some kind of fracture went into the special operations? For example, the military officer of Komsomolskaya Pravda, Alexander Kots, although positive, believes that this is not a turning point. Yupiy Podolyaka. - I absolutely agree with Alexander. It's not a fracture. To begin with, Soledar and Artemovsk or Bakhmut are not the main offensive operation, as far as I understand, which the Russian command is preparing for the winter campaign. This, we can say, is a grinding of reserves and a diversionary campaign, which should first of all deprive the enemy of the initiative and forces in order to parry the main blow. But still, the loss of Artemovsk and Soledar will inflict psychological losses on Kiev. Break it, this is also an important task. But I repeat, and Kots, I think, is also aware that this is not the main offensive operation that is supposed to be in this winter campaign. ""KP"". - Maybe you can clarify where the main directions are then? And when we start attacking there. Podolyaka. - I really hope that during January we will find out about it. But that's just my guess. In fact, that's what I'm most worried about. Because near Artemovsk, near Soledar, mainly the Wagner PMC works, everything is well debugged there. And our regular units, where there are now many mobilized, have not yet participated in large-scale offensives. And where is the main direction of the strike... It's not about the direction, it's about the result. ""KP"". -Ok. What result for us can be considered victorious. Podolyaka. - Defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because, let's be honest, now in Kiev they say that Ukraine is not Russia, but if we look carefully, they are just building an alternative Russia. Colonial Russia, an appendage of the West. It is for this reason that the West is helping this project. And as long as this project has an army, it will threaten the real Russia. Because its ultimate goal is the colonization of the entire post-Soviet space. ""KP"". - Nevertheless, there were successes in the special operation after a long stomping on the spot and even the withdrawal of troops. There was a promotion... Why? Surovikin changed tactics. Podolyaka. - And the tactics have been changed, and they have finally begun to fight in science, not in spite of. If, for example, we are on the defensive, it means that we are building this defense in a layered manner, with trenches, with systems of firing points. If we look at the reasons for our departure from Balakliya and Raisins, we will see that they were all because we ignored military science. We were on the defensive, but we seemed to be preparing for the offensive. And they didn't build points of resistance, they didn't put minefields. We had gaps between the defense nodes of 10-15 kilometers, without trenches, without anything. Of course, the enemy passed them in 20 minutes to our deep rear. So we got the result. Now, after the appointment of Surovikin as commander, wherever we do not expect to attack in the near future, a layered defense has been built. How it works we see under Kremennaya, near Svatovo. The enemy there tried many times to break through the defenses, but nothing came of it. That is, we finally began to fight according to the rules. The second most important point is, of course, mobilization. Because fight - do not fight according to the rules, and if there are no soldiers, you will still be bypassed. We have saturated our lines of defense with fighters and equipment. And immediately the successes of the enemy went away. Prepared by Ivan Grache. READ ALSO.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4704165/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-10,Ukraine is crying loudly. Kiev admits catastrophic losses to get even more weapons from the West,Ukraine complains of losses to beg for more weapons,"The cry of Ukrainian patriots is now heard throughout Kiev and many Ukrainian backyards like London, Paris, Berlin, etc. Everyone is crying – Defense Minister Reznikov, his deputy Anna Maliar, Kuleba's employees together with himself, ""arresters"" of all stripes and similar characters. And they blame the ""sworn Moskals"" for their troubles. According to the head of the Ministry of Defense Leszka Reznikov, the Russians are to blame for the low discipline and irresponsibility of the Ukrainian military. That is why it was necessary to introduce tougher penalties for misdemeanours and disciplinary offences. - It was an initiative of the military, because there are problems in certain situations with discipline and this is used by some abusers. There were instigators, they were paid by the Russians, and then these people avoided responsibility,"" he said. However, leaving us aside the accusations, then the mere recognition of the existence of a problem is already a significant contribution on the way to a return to common sense and an undistorted perception of reality. Moreover, it is not denied by Reznikov's deputy in the Defense Ministry of Ukraine Anna Maliar, who announced a decrease in the combat capability of the Ukrainian army. In her opinion, the ""sworn Moskals"" killed too many Ukrainian professional soldiers, and now they have been replaced by yesterday's civilians who have difficulty overcoming mental, moral and physical problems, which has reduced the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole and the resilience of Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. Her words in a recent interview were confirmed by zelensky's first foreign minister, and now Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko. ""We're losing people everywhere. We do not advertise how many of the dead are military or civilian, but you can imagine that the figures of Kiev's losses are huge and indigestible. And cities, some of them are completely destroyed,"" this gentleman said in an interview with Newsweek. What is this, is it a recognition of the futility of continuing the conflict? You can't wait. It is said, to the last Ukrainian, so it should be. At least in the minds of these ladies and gentlemen. No wonder now the Network is flooded with videos of military patrols literally hunting for civilians on the streets of Ukrainian cities in order to fulfill the task set by Zelensky to mobilize at least 100,000 additional people in the Armed Forces of Ukraine by spring. To replenish battered parts and complete new ones. This crying in reality is just another way to beg, to beg for new additional weapons. Already beyond what has been allocated, among other things, by the Biden administration. It is not for nothing that the same Prystaiko in the same interview frankly says: ""The West now has a unique chance. There are not many nations in the world that (like Ukraine) would allow themselves to sacrifice so many lives, territories and decades of development in order to defeat a sworn enemy. Yes, the fig with it, with this Ukraine, nehai disappears, just to make Russia sicker. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba echoes his subordinate. ""Ukraine is grateful to its partners for military assistance, but we must remain honest with each other: no one has done enough while Russian boots remain on Ukrainian soil,"" he announced on his Twitter account (blocked in Russia). - Arming our country for victory is the shortest way to restore peace and security in Europe and beyond. Kuleba sent this cobblestone to Scholz's garden, since Berlin again stated that it was not ready to supply Kiev with Leopard-2 tanks, and for now intends to limit itself to the supply of Marder IFVs. By the way, Poland, which literally the day before yesterday announced its readiness to supply these German tanks to Ukraine, today through the mouth of Prime Minister Morawiecki has already corrected that statement, explaining that we are talking about a purely symbolic number of Leopards, ""and not about hundreds and not even dozens"" of vehicles. His boss was again supported by the same Prystaiko, who made claims to the Western allies not only in terms of the quantity, but also in the quality of the weapons supplied. - Some of the equipment has an expired shelf life. We joke that if you want to recycle it, give it to us. We'll steer in the right direction. In normal, peaceful times, no one would want to be talked about in such terms. And now why not,"" he said. True, so far Zelensky's team has been most successful in disposing not so much of Western weapons as of Ukraine itself. But you can always blame Russia for everything. Even if these accusations are completely delusional, like Reznikov's latest statement, in which he accused Moscow of recruiting Ukrainian children. ""Russia was trying to get information about the location of strategically important facilities from Ukrainian children,"" the defense minister said, not some professional liar like Arestovich. - The organizers of this scheme sought to ensure that children unconsciously inform them of the locations of strategically important objects through a mobile game. And he summed it up: ""It's not just a dirty trick, it's a war crime."" At the same time, both Kiev and the West agree to carry and listen to any, even such nonsense, if only it were against Russia.

Ukrainian schoolchildren were taught by nationalists,Lists of 16-year-olds who were trained in military camps with nationalist instructors in Ukraine found,"The Ukrainian information group ""Beregini"", which has long been waging its secret struggle against the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Kiev regime, published lists of schoolchildren born in 2006, who were taken away in the autumn to study military specialties. The lists include boys in grades 10-11. ""We have repeatedly said that this wave of mobilization will be much more serious than all the previous ones. Politicians here in Ukraine have finally gone crazy and it seems that they have decided to recreate one children's organization. In the last century, an Austrian artist also taught children how to show a gesture from the heart to the sun. The artist died, but our Ukrainian politicians remember this gesture and are now actively using it. And it looks like it's not just him. They also remembered that children were mobilized in a neighboring country. They were dressed in military uniforms, distributed Faustpatrons and sent to fight the Russians,"" Beregini's employees who published the lists write. They say that the Faustpatrons have now replaced the Javelins, but the essence has remained the same: the nationalist regime seems intent on sending children to fight street fights with grenade launchers. ""Otherwise, it is impossible to explain the documents that we found in the possession of the military commissar, which collects information about schoolchildren. The foreign masters of our politicians thought that we would not know that they want to send our Ukrainian children to the new Hitler Youth,"" Beregin said. Zelensky will distribute grenade launchers to the children, and he will hide? And why not? This is exactly how Hitler behaved in April 1945: he handed the children grenade launchers, and he hid in the bunker. There are thousands of photographs in the historical archives of German children posing in front of Berlin with Faustpatrons. You can see How Hitler paternally pats the cheeks of teenagers, sending them to certain death. ""In the last months of the Great Patriotic War, members of the Hitler Youth detachments were given more modern Panzerfaust grenade launchers at that time. The boys were asked to shoot from the cellars at Soviet tanks and escape. Adult Volkssturm (militiamen) were ordered to stand to the death with old Steyr Mannlicher M carbines of 1890. There were no other weapons. Fortunately for us, the remnants of the 12th SS Division ""Hitler Youth"" finished off on May 8, 1945, the soldiers of the 65th Infantry Division of the 7th American Army, who sought to be the first to occupy Berlin. There are enough pictures on the Internet where cowboys are photographed holding small Nazis in camouflage uniforms by the scruff of the neck. Ukrainian media have already stated that the Kiev authorities are forming checkpoints from teenagers and local residents. They are given uniforms and weapons. And now it turns out that the Zelensky regime is preparing to sacrifice teenagers in urban battles. After all, it is impossible to determine the age of a person in a military uniform in a combat situation... According to the former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, Colonel Douglas McGregor, the Kiev regime sends 15-year-old teenagers to the front line in the Donbass because of the colossal losses of the Ukrainian army. ""Ukrainians suffered 'horrific' losses: 35,000 went missing, more than 100,000 died. And now they're trying to mobilize teenagers at the ages of 14 and 15.

The reason to become an activist is simple – his 24-year-old son, tractor driver Alexei, was called. To help the guy and his comrades not in word, but in deed, the father decided to deliver useful things and personalized parcels from relatives to the fighters.

It was decided to go around the entire line. There was a chance to meet my son in Zaporozhye. Vladimir kept secret from his wife that he was going to the combat zone and, moreover, would see Alex. The journey to my son took a week and was almost sleepless. -Dangerously. The road is very hard, there are many blown up bridges everywhere. Almost a thousand kilometers moved detours.

We have a lot of things to do, plans for life. We want to develop the farm. I recently bought my son a tractor. He loved to plow the land, - Vladimir shared his emotions. The father said that he did not remember the specifics of the conversation with his son after three months of separation - he was very emotional. They were able to talk for about an hour while they unloaded the trucks with the humanitarian. - I only remember my feelings. You know, like he never left. I made sure that he had good colleagues, friendly guys. He himself is healthy, well dressed. Does not let go of the machine gun from his hands, in full combat readiness even when receiving humanitarian aid. We hugged and cried. I handed him the parcel he ordered – a box of tangerines, – smiles Alexei's father. Together with his father, Alex recorded a video in which he congratulated his mother on her birthday. Vladimir admitted that at first the recording shocked his wife. But after that, she burst into tears. And now, a month later, he's watching the video and staring at his son. By the way, in mid-January, Vladimir will again go to the front line to deliver humanitarian cargo. A new gift for his son is ready – the father wants to pop in with Alexei again. - I bring my son oranges. I didn't want to go in January, of course. But it is necessary.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine lost 200 fighters in an unsuccessful attempt to counterattack Soledar. In addition, according to radio intercepts, company and battalion commanders were absent in the units thrown to break through the encirclement. Voenkor Kots named the place where the general battle of the SVO could take place. He explained that this settlement serves as an important point of defense of Donbass. In Ukraine, an air alert was announced in three regions on January 12, 2023. Alarms sounded in Poltava, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Ukrainian Ambassador to London Vadym Prystaiko said that Kiev had withdrawn part of the troops towards the Belarusian border. The Russian military shot down the Ukrainian Su-25. This was reported in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The Russian military destroyed five Ukrainian DRGs in the Kupyansk direction during the day. They were located in the vicinity of the settlements of Kislovka, Krakhmalnoye, Pershotravneve, Olshana and Tabaivka. Russian troops killed more than 100 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Krasnolimansky direction. Russian forces also managed to eliminate four armored combat vehicles and three vehicles. The DPR announced the destruction of about five brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Soledar. The figures for losses do not indicate mercenaries, said Pushilina's adviser. Rogov reported night explosions at military facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Zaporozhye. According to him, explosions were heard at facilities where ""there were military equipment and ammunition depots, firing positions of the militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine."" The Russian armed forces made a serious advance at Artemovsk, which was largely due to the advantage in artillery. Ukrainian troops shelled Makiivka in the DPR from MLRS. Three missiles were fired."

Here's an interview with one of them with CNN. ""We're holding on. Although almost independently. No commanders. It is not clear who our neighbors are, but someone is there and fighting. We have no connection with them."" There is a loss of control when units do not know that they are already surrounded. And maybe they're fighting each other. According to unverified information, part of the soledar garrison may be hiding in salt mines underground. Now there is information that Kiev is pulling reserves to the city. But not for the sake of the ""prisoners of the dungeon"". Zelensky and his associates have repeatedly become hostages to symbols. This was the case in Ilovaisk, Donetsk airport, and Azovstal. From the doomed centers of defense, Ukrainian propaganda paints an image of the invincibility and steadfastness of its army. Instead of taking the units out of harm's way, as it was smart enough to do in Lisichansk. At the same time, in Kiev, of course, there are no fools sitting. And they understand that by throwing reserves into battle, they risk a Russian offensive in weakened areas. Let's see what will win: Zelensky's PR or Zaluzhny's military thought. Their rivalry is already palpable. LISTEN AS WELL. Special operation may end within two months (more)"

We will cite from it the materials of criminal cases and figures, which were told by the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia. ""We managed to bring to court 82,000 criminal cases against more than 92,000 defendants. According to the investigated cases, damage in the amount of almost 400 billion rubles was established. Thanks to our investigators, more than 247 billion rubles were reimbursed and the property of the accused was seized in the amount of 123.5 billion rubles (data for 11 months of 2022). Thus, we contributed to the compensation of 93% of the damage caused by crimes. In absolute terms, the results of work on compensation for victims are twice as high as last year."" ""Since 2014, 2406 criminal cases have been initiated, of which 1752 cases on the facts of shelling the territories of the DPR and LPR. According to the investigation, as a result of the criminal actions of the Ukrainian side for 8 years, at least 13.7 thousand residents of Donbass suffered. Of these, 4.9 thousand were killed and 8.8 thousand were injured. In the cases under investigation, more than 120 thousand residents of Donbass were recognized as victims. Criminal prosecutions are being carried out against 665 persons. Decisions have been made to prosecute 390 persons, 178 of them in person. Among the defendants are 115 persons from among the commanders and leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 132 defendants were arrested in absentia. Investigations into 138 criminal cases of the use of prohibited means and methods of warfare by military personnel of the VFU, as well as cruel treatment of the civilian population and prisoners of war, have been completed."" ""In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation, the Investigative Committee has been allocated an additional staff. The structures and staffing of investigative departments in these territories in the amount of 853 units have been approved. At the moment, they are being staffed. For this, a reserve of 500 people has already been formed. It included not only current, but also former employees of the department, employees of the prosecutor's offices of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, who wished to serve in the Investigative Committee of Russia. "" ""At the moment, we see an increase in the crime of migrants. In 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated more than 36 thousand crimes committed by them, which is 10% more than in 2021. At the same time, a significant part of them are serious and especially serious crimes, in particular, murder, rape. These issues are systematically discussed at meetings under the Vice-President of the Security Council. The Investigative Committee has long spoken about the need to introduce mandatory genomic registration of all foreign citizens arriving in the Russian Federation. With this in mind, it is necessary to return to our proposal, but, of course, taking into account the comparison of the financial costs of genomic registration with the costs of identifying suspects in the commission of crimes. After all, the practice of investigating criminal cases committed in conditions of non-obviousness shows that a significant part of such crimes is solved precisely thanks to molecular genetic studies. Along with this, it is advisable to work out the issue of codification of migration legislation."" ""By acquiring Russian citizenship, these people (former migrants - Ed.) not only are they entitled, but they are also subject to the obligations set out in the legislation in force. One of them is the passage of military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in accordance with the requirements. In the context of a special military operation, the state stimulates foreign citizens to enter military service under a contract, providing the opportunity to obtain Russian citizenship in a simplified manner. Statistics show that foreigners massively receive Russian citizenship, bypassing military service. Over the past five years, it has been purchased by more than a million people who came from the countries of Central Asia and Transcaucasia, including 550,000 former residents of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Only in the first half of 2022, more than 60 thousand adult citizens of these states received Russian citizenship, and, consequently, not only rights, but also a constitutional duty to protect the country that adopted them. In this regard, it is advisable to consider the priority of sending naturalized citizens to participate in the performance of the tasks of a special military operation. "" ""For 11 months of 2022, the property of those accused in corruption cases has already been arrested in the amount of 61 billion rubles."" ""In the case of the former Governor of the Penza region Belozertsev and other persons, the property of the accused was seized for a total amount of more than 1.8 billion rubles. In particular, on the property of Belozertsev - in the amount of 470 million rubles, including expensive watches, luxury goods and 61 real estate objects registered in the name of his relatives, on the property of bribe-givers with a total value of 1.2 billion rubles in the form of real estate, jewelry and more than 3.5 thousand rare works of printing and painting. "" ""The Main Investigation Department for the city of Moscow is investigating a criminal case against the directors of two organizations: LLC ""RPK-Spetsproekt"" and FSUE ""GosZMP"". They are charged with embezzlement in the execution of a state contract for the reconstruction and technical re-equipment of production for the production of new dosage forms of socially significant drugs. According to it, property worth more than 1 billion rubles was seized. Another case is against the traffic police officers of the North-Eastern Administrative District of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in Moscow, according to which apartments, about 30 buildings, more than 10 land plots were arrested, in Moscow and other regions, as well as in Bulgaria, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, cars, accounts, bank cells. The cost of this property is more than 500 million rubles."" ""According to the investigation, Anatoly Tikhonov (former Deputy Minister of Energy) received bribes totaling more than 122 million rubles and embezzled more than 271 million rubles allocated for the creation of the state information system of the fuel and energy complex."" ""The preliminary investigation into the criminal case, in which 6 people are accused of stealing a total of 80 items of property with a total value of more than 44.5 million rubles from the storage facilities of military units and institutions located in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Region, has been completed. Three defendants have concluded pre-trial agreements on cooperation and the criminal case against them has been transferred for a decision on referral to the court, three more continue to familiarize themselves with the materials. There are other criminal cases initiated by investigators on the facts of theft of military property, but the investigation into them has not yet been completed."" ""For 11 months of 2022, 5665 crimes of previous years were solved, including more than 800 murders. This is the result of painstaking work of forensic services and investigators of the Investigative Committee of Russia. In particular, with the assistance of forensic units in the Republic of Tatarstan, work was carried out on a criminal case against members of the Tukaevskie gang involved in the murders in Moscow and Kazan in 1993-2002. As a result, it was possible to identify one of the leaders of this gang, he is currently in custody. The criminal case will soon be transferred to the court. Also, in the course of the provision of practical assistance by criminologists of the central office in this criminal case, two crimes committed by members of the Tukaevskie gang in the cities of Moscow and Cheboksary in the early 2000s were solved.

It was formed in the autumn in Zhytomyr on the basis of the 199th training center of the airborne assault troops. The ""elite unit"" consisted of at least three battalions. They had dozens of tanks and IFVs of Soviet and Western production. Most of the paratroopers were trained in Britain. A special training center was created for them there. But the rush on the part of the cool British military instructors didn't help the raguls to become supermen. In Soledar, the brigade fell into the cauldron. Many of the paratroopers surrendered. Those who did not have time to raise their hands folded their heads. The British flag was torn up like a heating pad. Igor Kimakovsky, adviser to the acting head of the DPR, said that Russian troops had seriously advanced in the area of Artemovsk, He said: ""Artillery suppresses the enemy's forces. In some areas, they cannot climb out of the trenches. This is also evident in the Donetsk direction. The number of attacks on the city has decreased. Our troops are starting to work more efficiently. We have certain advances in the Avdiivka direction."" According to the head of the DPR Pushilin, the opportunities for the liberation of Artemovsk have improved manifold. And Kiev is composing another heroic epic about epic heroes on unbreakable frontiers. Our military has developed good software for Smartphones on the Android system. It determines the coordinates of the enemy's artillery by the sounds of gunshots. The magazine ""Arsenal of the Fatherland"" reports that this is a non-standard means of artillery reconnaissance, used along with the sound-measuring complexes in service with the Russian army. The authors of the publication specify: ""Four sound meters with smartphones (tablets) are located at a distance of 3-6 km from the line of combat contact. And with the help of such software, the time of detection of the sound of a shot is determined both in automatic and manual mode. "" Time synchronization is carried out according to the data of the satellite navigation system. If there is a connection between smartphones, internal synchronization occurs. The received values are transmitted to the central tablet. And the coordinates of the sounding target are calculated. Which is quickly covered with a copper basin. Uralvagonzavod supplied the Ministry of Defense with a new batch of modern T-90M Proryv tanks. This is an upgraded version of the T-90A main battle tank. Equipped with a new turret, dynamic protection of a new generation, a new gun, modern means of communication, a more powerful engine. The tank conveyor is now working around the clock - like other shops of mechanical assembly production of UVZ. The staff of the Nizhny Tagil enterprise ""is doing everything possible for the successful implementation of tasks of national importance."" Now try to stop this ""Breakthrough"". Carlos del Toro, the US Secretary of the Navy, believes that the continuation of the military conflict in Ukraine for many months will be a threat to the American military-industrial complex. The minister said: ""If the conflict continues from six months to a year, it will threaten the supply chain."" Del Toro called on arms manufacturers to increase investments in labor and make capital investments to increase the volume of military-industrial production. America must be great again, as Trump has bequeathed — but without the Ukrainian hassle. Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador in London, said Ukraine had withdrawn some troops to the north of the country, to the borders with Belarus. On Sky News, the diplomat said: ""We are forced to transfer troops to the north of Ukraine. We had to take them away from the front line to be sure that they would not come and try to cut the line that connects us with the West."" Naïve rabbits can't see beyond their carrots.

The KP.RU website publishes the latest news online about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on January 13, 2023. The Ministry of Defense of Russia officially announced the liberation of the city of Soledar (Donetsk People's Republic). The Russian military department explained that the establishment of full control of the Russian Armed Forces over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes of Ukrainian troops in the south-west of the city of Artemovsk, and then block and take into the ""cauldron"" the remaining units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Unlike the former commander of the SVO, Army General Sergei Surovikin, he will not have to spend precious time ""coordinating with Moscow"" the plans for certain operations. In addition, he will always have two Commanders-in-Chief ""at hand"": Sergei Surovikin - aerospace forces, and Oleg Salyukov - ground forces. The appearance of such a high-ranking cohort at the head of the SVO is a sure sign of the coming changes at the front. Absolutely. Taking into account the fact that the West continues to actively pump the Ukrainian army with weapons and mercenaries, the command of the SVO will objectively be forced to ""extinguish"" this process - to destroy the enemy's equipment on the road to the battlefield. The essence of such a strategy is clear - to make arms supplies from NATO countries to Ukraine meaningless. We can expect a much larger use of attack drones, hypersonic missiles and tanks. Once soledar has been fully in control of Soledar, the command will not stop. For there is another powerfully fortified area ahead - Artemovsk. Taking it will mean breaking through the first echelon of the enemy's strategic defense. It is possible that in the near future this is the No. 1 task for Gerasimov and his deputies. But for this it is necessary to prepare very seriously (personnel, reserves, military equipment, ammunition). And, of course, to outplay the opponent with a cunning plan (Gerasimov has repeatedly shown that he can do it brilliantly). One of the first tasks, as already mentioned, is to take Artemovsk after Soledar. And there is expected a general battle for the complete liberation of the DPR. And there the Kiev generals have long been preparing an ""impregnable fortress"" for our army. It is very possible that during this battle there will be one of the turning points of the entire special operation. By ""expanding the scale of the tasks to be solved"", perhaps, we meant the full establishment of our control over the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, as well as over the Black Sea region and the Azov Sea region (and here you have both Odessa and Mykolaiv regions).

Some might have had the impression, some time ago, that the General Staff was distancing itself from interfering in the affairs of the SVO. - In what sense. - Well, as it seemed to someone, if he does not completely distance himself from the leadership of the special operation, then he participates in it somehow... indirectly. There was even public criticism from the military. Decisions were made from the commander of the operation to the level of the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister of Defense, bypassing the operational management or the General Staff itself. - Well, now. - When Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, was appointed head of the operation, everything fell into place. - So that's the way it should be. - I think so. And since the commander-in-chief of the Ground Forces, Oleg Salyukov, became his deputy in the leadership of the joint group, a team was formed that, in my opinion, corresponds to our traditional ideas that representatives of the Stavka should be at the forefront of the special operation, where certain areas are seriously removed from the center of decision-making. I think it will. - They will manage together, from Moscow, or separately, from specific areas. - The line of combat contact is about a thousand kilometers. Plus, a section of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. And all this is far from Moscow. Everything stretches from Kherson to Belarus. Huge distances. Perhaps it is required that some team of managers be concentrated in one place, but each is responsible for its own direction. - General Surovikin, who held the post of commander of the group since October 2022, is now Gerasimov's deputy. It's a downgrade. - I was talking about the Stavka representative in battle formations. Surovikin, apparently, will be. Although I know for sure that both Salyukov and, for example, Lapin have repeatedly visited these places. Probably, now the main issues will simply be resolved more quickly. - Which ones. - One of the problems was the multi-stage preparation and decision-making. This delay was criticized by many in the military. I think now decisions can be made directly by Gerasimov, based on the situation. - And how the scenario of a military conflict will change. - Do not think that there are new big bosses - and everything will instantly change. Like Surovikin, who appeared in October, it did not appear immediately, with five or ten missing divisions. But the element of his involvement took its toll. - That's going to happen here. - I think that decisions will be made more quickly, command and control systems will begin to develop more dynamically. I hope we will see the most optimal form of management for today. The contact line is huge, its sections are very far from each other, and there are objective difficulties here. - They raise the issue of raising the draft age to 30 years. - I have always said that it was impossible to evade the principle of mobilization readiness. Everyone must serve in our army necessarily for military service, before entering the institute. After that, the contract, the institute. Like, for example, in the Israeli army. The mobilization reserve is sacred for our country, it is mandatory. That's my position. - So as for age. - It doesn't matter. Not everyone was always drafted at the age of 18. In the USSR and in Russia, a reprieve was given for the completion of education. I served after night school. This is important for the training of the missing link in the armed forces - sergeants and junior officers. You can make a decision that people will be drafted into the army from the age of 18, that this will be a universal military duty, and give for various reasons deferrals for a year, two, three, including the completion of education, with the condition that you will then receive a military registration specialty and will be released as a second lieutenant or lieutenant.

Comfortable furniture, bright play complexes, separate bedrooms, a catering unit and a laundry room with the latest equipment. On the street there are spacious play areas, flower beds, greenery, interesting sculptures of children's favorite characters. The solemn opening ceremony of the kindergarten was attended by the Governor of the Tver region Igor Rudenya, who received the object. By the way, in 2022 in the Tver region, military builders erected a number of important civilian facilities - a sports rowing base and two children's clinics. All works were carried out within the framework of a comprehensive program for the development of local social and infrastructure projects."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4705054/,Oleksandr BOYKO,2023-01-12,Investigative Committee of Russia: the Azov regiment* was engaged in the destruction of Mariupol on the instructions of Kiev,"From there came criminal orders to hold the defense of the city by any, even prohibited methods and means.","On the eve of the Day of Formation of the Investigative Committee of Russia (celebrated on January 15), the Chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia Alexander Ivanovich Bastrykin held an operational meeting of the headquarters in Donetsk. It's not the first or the last. In the new regions of Russia, in the formed departments, a special group of investigators is engaged in solving crimes committed by Ukrainian armed groups against the civilian population and Russian servicemen. The participants of the meeting regularly report to the head of the department relevant information. Thus, from the testimony of one of the detainees it follows: ""I was aware that our crew could strike not only at the enemy, but also at civilian infrastructure, and civilians could become victims of our shelling. But we didn't care."" But another soldier of the regiment ""Azov""* revealed: ""Killing people is not a problem for me, especially russians."" During the investigation of criminal cases of war crimes of Ukrainian nationalists in Mariupol, the investigation studied materials from documents, phones and hard drives of computers that were found in the areas of hostilities in the city. From the content of these documents and the analysis of the testimonies of the interrogated persons, it follows that the commander of the separate special forces detachment ""Azov""* personally reported the operational situation and the course of hostilities to the highest military-political leadership of Ukraine. And from them came criminal orders to hold the defense of the city by any, even prohibited methods and means. Investigators of the Investigative Committee of Russia continue to identify and document the facts of participation in hostilities on the side of Ukraine of foreign mercenaries. Thus, from the testimony of one of the prisoners of war, it follows that at the Nikolaev training ground there were instructors from Canada who took part in the training of Ukrainian servicemen. Also, according to the testimony of another prisoner of war, back in 2021, the military training of his colleagues was carried out by instructors from the UK, who taught the rules of warfare, including various tactical techniques. Separately, the head of the department was informed of the preliminary results of the investigation of the criminal case into the death in Donetsk of the deputy head of the control and investigative department of the military investigative department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Joint Group of Forces (Forces) Yevgeny Rybakov. After hearing the reports of his subordinates, Bastrykin demanded to strengthen security measures when the department's officers were in the CVO zone. Following the meeting, the Chairman of the Investigative Committee gave a number of instructions and outlined the timing of their implementation. In the final part of the event, A.I. Bastrykin awarded employees of various divisions of the Investigative Committee of Russia with departmental medals, noting the high professional qualities of the officers of the department and thanking them for their courage in the performance of official duty. The meeting participants discussed the organization of the work of the newly created investigative departments in the territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. First Deputy Chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia Eduard Kaburneev stressed the importance of this activity and the need for personal participation in it of the heads of territorial investigative units. The Investigative Committee was able, following the appeals of citizens, to establish the whereabouts of 85 missing persons in the zone of the CVO. At the same time, A.I. Bastrykin was informed about measures to create a DNA database of unidentified civilians whose bodies were discovered after the liberation of the city of Mariupol and other settlements of Donbass and buried in unmarked graves. This measure will primarily contribute to the identification of the deceased and the establishment of the circumstances of the crimes committed against them. In order to implement this task, a working group was formed, which included investigators, experts of the SEC and criminologists of the GUK, who began work in this direction. Activities to search for servicemen performing the tasks of a special military operation are also continuing. A total of 133 servicemen have been located to date. *Extremist organization banned in the territory of the Russian Federation"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4704855/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-11,Kiev knew that the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Soledar were doomed. And he took this bloody step.,Military enlistment offices in Ukraine are raking in the Armed Forces of Ukraine all those who can be caught,"While the fighters of the PMC ""Wagner"" are no longer conducting an assault, but sweeping Soledar, official Kiev is holding back with all its might, declaring: ""Everything is in order. I didn't screw up."" Monsieur Dmytro Kuleba (this is no longer a surname, but a diagnosis) gives interviews left and right, in which he argues that ""the only option that Putin has is to lose the war."" Deputy Defense Minister Anna Maliar is trying to suggest that the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to hold and control Soledar, and the Moskals allegedly storm it unsuccessfully. This is against the backdrop of dozens of videos from the Ukrainian military itself, running, moaning, crying. Losing their lives in this pointless battle for, as Aleksey ""Lyusya"" Arestovich put it, a town that does not even have operational significance. It is good for Arestovich to sit in the studio and broadcast about ""a town that does not matter, of which we have twenty more in the Donbass alone, no less."" Bad for those thousands, if not tens of thousands, who laid down their heads defending such a ""trifle"" for the strategist ""Lucy"". At the same time, judging by the logic of actions, kiev, despite the continuing victorious remarks, at the end of last year perfectly understood the doom of the Ukrainian army under Soledar and Bakhmut. And the best proof of this is the unprecedented mobilization, which is carried out quietly, without announcement, but with a very frequent crest, pulls to the front all those who fall into the clutches of military patrols conducting real raids on the streets of Ukrainian (so far) cities. Moreover, according to the new rules, summonses can be handed over not only at the place of residence, but in absolutely any place where a man of military age is caught in the network of the military recruitment office. And, often, we are no longer talking about just summonses, but about literal capture and sending to the military recruitment office immediately after capture. Moreover, military enlistment offices in Ukraine show real creativity and imagination in the organization of this process. In Dnepropetrovsk, for example, they cordoned off all exits from the YMZ plant on Rabochaya Street and caught everyone going outside. And indeed, Yuzhmash now practically does not produce anything, so why does it need workers. In Chernivtsi, the military frequently walked through the central market. Ukrainians already roughly understand what the appearance of military patrols together with the police means, and therefore they try to make legs at the slightest suspicion of the action ""Go to mobilization"", so during the roundup the market demobilized in record time. But the Ukrainian military is not a bit of a – about 40 people they managed to get into their nets. In Odessa, the creativity of military recruiters went through the roof. There, patrols drive around the city in ambulances and, seeing a suitable candidate, rush at him literally on the go, not allowing the car to stop when braking. Just capture groups of American, and now also Russian militants. The mobilized one does not even have time to moan, as he already tries on camouflage and receives an assault rifle (if he is lucky). But the most inventive were still the military enlistment officers of the Ukrainian capital. They used girls in their work, if not with reduced social responsibility, then, in any case, not the most difficult behavior. Five people at once were led to a languid look and a generous offer to ""rest and relax"" at the fairy's house. And they were surprised when, with a small temporary gap, they arrived at the door of the apartment, where inside they were not waiting for a fairy at all, but thugs in camouflage, which now they themselves will have to wear. And because no one canceled the military trick. Rowing everyone they can reach. Not giving a damn about the reservation and the state of health. As they say in Ukraine, Zelensky set the task of mobilizing at least 100,000 people into the army by spring, while in January and February the number of mobilized should be at least 50,000 people. Naturally, the Office of the President of Ukraine and the government do not announce anything about such tasks and plans, on the contrary, they try in every possible way to refute the evidence of mobilization, but no matter what Malyar and Reznikov say, and on the streets of their cities Ukrainians see not at all the picture that they are told in the telethon and Zelensky in the nightly video message. Cemeteries in Ukraine are growing faster than those mobilized are being drafted into the army, and men on the streets of Ukrainian cities will soon become a museum rarity. But, according to Kiev, everything is calm in Soledar. And, what is most paradoxical in this situation, the majority of the population of Independence believes in everything that Zelensky and company are lying to them. And in their minds, they are already marching Through Red Square. P.S. Just the day before, Zelensky in his video message said that Soledar gave time to buy time. But for what exactly, he did not explain. Is it really for Zelensky to speak online at the Golden Globes ceremony in Hollywood, where he again asked for money and weapons? How many thousands has Zelensky buried for this opportunity? Nothing, he'll put even more to the Oscars. READ ALSO. Brutal appeals under champagne.

As a result of a mortar shell that exploded nearby, Igor received a concussion, but did not leave the battle, and after changing position he continued to fire at the militants.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4704782/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-01-11,"Zelensky demanded to die, and officers abandoned soldiers: Brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who were going to go to the Crimea, were defeated in Soledar","Russian troops grinded several Ukrainian brigades in Soledar, which Kiev was preparing for an offensive on the Crimea.","The first clashes near the small Donbas town began in May and went on for almost half of the year. Military KP.RU Dmitry Steshin tried to understand the significance of this victory and its consequences for Kiev. The fact that something terrible and unpleasant happened in Soledar became clear from the activity of Ukrainian propagandists – they still feel at ease in our information space and social networks. The template for distribution was, ""Hurry up to see! The second army of the world has finally captured the district center!"" There was despair in those screams. That the Volga Tsaritsyn-Stalingrad, that the unsightly Prokhorovka, remained in history, because it was there that the Third Reich broke the spinal ridge and it is not so important where this happened. The Germans themselves were well aware of this military subtlety, Field Marshal Helmut Moltke wrote in the century before last: ""The goal of any operation should not be the territory, but the enemy's army. If the army ends, the territory will come by itself"" and for the clueless repeated once again: ""The main object of operations should not be the territory or fortified point of the enemy, but his army. Only its defeat can decide the outcome of the campaign."" Soledar itself is indeed a very modest town with a population of 10,000 people. I survived two historical names - Bryantsevka and a very awkward, brain-drying and breaking language - Karlo-Libknechtovo! In 1991, they settled on the human and understandable name Soledar. The fact is that under the city, at a depth of 200-300 meters, there are colossal layers of rock salt of the highest quality - you can pack directly from under the tunneling combine for sale. Despite the fact that salt has been mined in these places since the 17th century, so far only 3% of the reserves have been mastered. There are deposits of alabaster and refractory clay in Soledar, factories for processing and, most importantly, logistics: a railway branch with the Sol station and a major road junction. Everything that is needed for a large defensive node of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, docked by a flank with another node - Bakhmut (Artemovsky). And behind Soledar and Bakhmut there is a direct road to the largest agglomeration in Donbass - Konstantinovka, Druzhkovka, Nikolaevka, Kramatorsk and Slavyansk. Already in November, when it became clear that the Russians would not retreat and would break and grind the enemy, the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine started talking about withdrawing to Kramatorsk, which would become the main hub of Ukrainian defense in the Donbas. The idea was pushed personally by the commander of the Ukrainian troops Zaluzhny, but did not find understanding in Kiev, where they are very sensitive to reputational losses. It is under its reputation that Ukraine receives money and weapons from the West. And the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have to pay for this. Officially (as announced by the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine), the battles for Soledar began on August 3. The Russian troops here pressed the enemy unusually systematically and in concert. That is, together with the neighboring Bakhmut, not only head-on, but also on the flanks, gradually occupying the dominant heights and suburban settlements turned by the Armed Forces of Ukraine into strongholds. Two cities - Bakhmut and Soledar by the New Year were already in a semi-encirclement. A little later, the road linking these defensive knots was cut. Yes, the ""first violin"" in these battles was held by the ""musicians"" from the Wagner PMC, but both paratroopers and guys from the LPR fought shoulder to shoulder with them. It is curious that the entire information focus of late autumn and winter was focused on Bakhmut. Although, the Ukrainian press was no less picturesque about the battles in Soledar: ""Exhausting battles that are characterized by artillery duels."" Aviation and drones, and heavy flamethrower systems were used. At the same time, the ""weight of the volley"" we had was immeasurably greater. Already in early December, Ukrainian ""hackers"" began to complain in social networks that ""artillery does not support us."" Almost simultaneously, there were complaints about terrible losses. It is difficult to name how much, such data is always classified. But you can understand by indirect data. The Fourth Separate Tank Brigade (about 90 tanks in 3 battalions and 30 armored personnel carriers) and the 60th, 61st, 62nd and 63rd separate mechanized brigades with their communications, artillery, medicine, sapper and engineering services, etc. were transferred to Soledar from the so-called ""NATO reserve"" of Ukraine. According to a number of signs, it was the Bakhmut-Soledar ""meat grinder"" that disrupted the planned offensive of Ukraine in the Zaporozhye region - to Melitopol and the Crimea. There was no one to attack. It is curious that it was the Western advisers, who are fighting Ukraine against Russia, who first understood the meaning of what was happening in Soledar-Bakhmut. But they failed to put pressure on the political leadership of Ukraine. Kiev also did not listen to its military, moreover, a serious conflict allegedly arose between Zelensky and Zaluzhny. Then, the West decided to use PR. A whole troop of Western journalists from the most authoritative publications – from Newswick to the Washington Post – walked through Bakhmut and Soledar. All of them described the miserable situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the shortage of artillery and ammunition and, finally, the terrible losses. But, Zelensky was adamant, like Hitler at Stalingrad. He even stopped by Bakhmut for a few minutes before a voyage to the United States to reward distinguished ""zahistniks"". And quickly left, leaving them to unravel their bloody mess. In Soledar, the Ukrainian army had a particularly hard time. The day before the fall of the city, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel-General Syrsky, came here. He called the ""Wagnerians"" professionals, but stressed that ""they have no success"" and also quickly left Soledar. Everything became clear to everyone. The first to falter were the foreign mercenaries. They were the first to report that the road between Bakhmut and Soledar was cut and the city was in a semi-encirclement. Trying to save the remnants of the combat-ready Ukrainian troops, the American CNN brought out a soldier from Soledar, and he reported the following: ""The situation is critical, the number of dead is high, no one counts the dead."" Literally. - The personnel of our units has been updated by almost half. We don't even have time to remember each other's call signs. The speech was anonymous so that ""the soldier would not be hurt."" In this planting of the West, one could read its growing concern – it needs Ukraine and Russia to fight as long as possible, if possible, while maintaining the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Such a touching concern. ""Everyone understands that Soledar will be abandoned, everyone understands this. What's the point of dying for him?"" the ""zahistnik"" concluded. Everything was already a foregone conclusion. On christmas night, Soledar's defenses were breached, and on January 10, the Wagnerites reached the city administration building. In all city assaults, this is a psychologically important object. The attackers realized that they had won, the defenders had lost and they had to save themselves or die. One of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, having reached the Internet, recorded a video in good Russian language, with a checkmate: ""Good evening, we came out of Soledar, these ****** (meaning officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - Auth.) we were abandoned. We wanted to get out yesterday, and these ***** (escaped. - Author.). Officer's word ***** (nothing) is worthless."" The video is short, but it has a lot of meaning. The first meaning: the Armed Forces of Ukraine, unable to bear losses and pressure, fled from Soledar themselves. The second meaning: the officers fled first, abandoning their soldiers, that is, there was a ""loss of control of the troops"" or, simply, the defeat of the enemy, and not a systematic withdrawal. Unfortunately, some of them managed to get out of Soledar. They withdrew not far and not close, entrenched in 10-20 kilometers from Soledar, at the limit of the effectiveness of the fire of the main artillery systems. In the city itself, from 500 to 800 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remained surrounded. Kiev began to ask for a ""corridor"" for their exit. Perhaps they will come out, on exchange. But first, captivity. According to rumors, in the neighboring Bakhmut, the mood of the Ukrainian garrison is vile. Their flank from soledar is now completely open, ours continue to advance. The defense of Kramatorsk is getting closer, and there - and Slavyansk is a stone's throw away, the creak of the wheel of Samsara is heard - the confrontation in the Donbass returns to its original, sacred point.

However, Liana does not want to associate herself with today's Germany. She calls her real homeland a country that no longer exists today - the GDR. That was the beginning of our conversation. - For me personally, the GDR is, first of all, the cool action films of the DEFA Film studio with Gojko Mitić as the most fearless Indian. And, of course, scarce shoes and household appliances. And for you. - Wonderful childhood and youth. Full accessibility of all types of education. From the age of 3 I was engaged in figure skating, then I was cycling. My brother went to music school and played a lot of instruments. We tried ourselves in different fields: science, languages, museums, clubs. They visited concentration camps to remember the horrors of fascism. They were friends with all peoples, first of all, with the USSR. - And how is it now in a united Germany. I'm a mom myself, and I know what my kids are getting now. From school programs removed the reading of books and poems, the study of many sciences, even children's singing. An uneducated society is formed, like biomass, which is easy to manage. Even the history of the GDR must disappear, it must be erased from memory. The same Brecht, Heinrich Heine, Tucholsky .., when I quoted these classics, then, imagine, fell under sanctions. - Because of this, you got involved in politics. - No, it's probably education. My father and grandfather were members of the government. My grandmother owned the largest library in Berlin. She opened it up to everyone. And it was forced to close when the GDR was annexed. - Do you think that the GDR was annexed. - In sports school, we were instilled with a sense of partnership and a sense of justice. With the annexation of my homeland, not only sports ended. My section was closed, the coach was fired. Why? I started thinking about it, and then I just started hating the system. After all, the GDR underwent a tough denazification. And Germany? Together with the Nazis and nato invaders, it built its statehood in such a way that all those who served in the Wehrmacht were not only rehabilitated, but also given privileges. So no one fought fascism here, it was simply hidden under the mantle of democracy. And by the way, during the annexation of the GDR, there was no referendum, everything was decided for us. They took away our land and industry and annexed it to the Federal Republic of Germany. They made us second-class Germans: as former citizens of the GDR, we receive pensions and salaries a third lower than German citizens. Our diplomas, despite their brilliant education, are not recognized in the country, so none of the East Germans occupies leadership positions. - How did your foundation appear? What's so special about it. - The Foundation works with those countries where there is a war, but some projects are conducted in parallel. We emerged to help Donbass, and then expanded to Yemen and Syria, Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Lebanon, Peru and Nepal. The reason for the creation was the beginning by Kiev of an undeclared war in the Donbas. Do not forget on May 2, 2014, Odessa, the arson of the House of Trade Unions. Journalists of our foundation were on the spot, we saw all this with our own eyes, we cried. The fact that the hydra of fascism raised its head here was the declaration of war on Russia. I would like to note that President Steinmeier was later in Odessa, but ignored this crime. Thus, he untied Kiev's hands for subsequent atrocities. Of course, our foundation expressed the sharpest protest. We celebrated the 70th anniversary of liberation from fascism, and the Bundeskanzler Merkel did not come to Moscow for the first time. Members of our foundation, dressed in T-shirts with the inscription ""Thank you for the victory!"", laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Alexander Garden near the Kremlin. Since that time, our convoys began to move through Moscow to the Donbass. - Tell us about this work. - For more than 8 years we have made more than 800 projects. Many residents of the GDR studied in the Soviet Union. We have many ties with Kiev, Horlivka, Donetsk. We started with the creation of sewing production in Horlivka. Of course, they also supplied food and clothing, but we believe that the main thing is to create jobs, let people earn money and feed their families. We opened a school for integration. The hostel for 21 places was renovated. We supply seed material in order to grow crops ourselves, locally. We conduct sports events and cultural programs. They were just in the house of culture in Horlivka when a rocket hit its roof. - Why is your charitable foundation outlawed in Germany. - Since February of this year, cash flows have been stopped, convoys have been detained ""for special checks""."" Our work no longer fits not only into the policy of Germany, but also of the whole of Europe, with its bestial Russophobia. Everything has been turned upside down: allegedly, Russia is the aggressor, and we are helping it. In general, this is the first, egregious case in the entire modern history of Germany, when a charitable foundation is deprived of the status of a non-profit association and the account is closed. Cars with Ukrainian license plates are on duty under my windows. The goal is to intimidate. Those who are called refugees, but in fact they are notorious Bandera members, were told ""from above"": ""fas!"" What is it, if not the new Gestapo. - Now you have decided to finally move to Russia. - I once again came to Donetsk with humanitarian aid. Of course, I never intended to stay here forever. But it was at this time in Germany that everything began. The laws changed in just 2-3 days. - And you were on a business trip at the time. - Yes, and I had a return ticket for October 13. But the staff of the fund, and the family, and all acquaintances said: stay, in Germany you will face a criminal article. And I had to stay in Russia. With one bag and, I repeat, with a return ticket. No one knew there would be problems. While all this was unfolding, of course, the deadline for submitting documents has already passed. Two kind people, Masha and Vitaly, brought me to the migration service (FMS). But I was denied an application for political refugee status. I understand that civil servants have a duty to adhere to the law. But I was still upset and disappointed when I was told that it was better to apply for the status of an ordinary migrant. - But they persecute you in your homeland for political reasons.... - You are right. And here I consider it useful and necessary to continue my activities. To help Donbass. Strengthen solidarity, friendship and mutual assistance with Russia. Various organizations asked for this, more than a hundred letters in my support came only from Donbass! Maybe the problem is that the law on the status of a political refugee was adopted in 1993 and needs some kind of updating? I have heard that work is underway in this regard in the State Duma and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.., but I do not know about the Federal Migration Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. The trouble is that my visa is already expiring. And I'm, of course, very upset, because all of this, in general, is wrong. After all, I am not the only one who will only get worse with each new Russophobic law that comes out in Europe. These laws will squeeze out Russia's friends from everywhere. They will have to say goodbye to their profession, to their usual way of life and even to the Motherland! You will have to leave, but where, if not to Russia? So, we need to solve this problem together. It is necessary to create an anti-fascist movement in order to fight together this terrible plague that is waking up in Europe and threatening the whole world."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4706352/,Elena AFONINA,2023-01-15,Why Artemovsk is so important and why the West tells in advance about the retreat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Important answers are given,Expert Litovkin explained why WP issued a material about the plans for the retreat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Artemovsk,"What is happening in the Donbass in the area of strategically important for us and for the Ukrainians of Artemovsk, to which considerable forces of Russian troops were sent after the liberation of Soledar. Recall that on the afternoon of January 15, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation told about the successes of our fighters in this direction. - Assault squads, in cooperation with units of the Airborne Forces, with the support of army aviation, missile troops and artillery of the Southern Military District, developed success in the direction of the northern outskirts of the city of Artemivsk of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Sol railway station. During the hostilities, more than 80 Ukrainian servicemen, two tanks, three armored fighting vehicles and three cars were destroyed during the day, the military department said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are considering the option of retreating from Artemovsk. We discussed all the latest news on radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" with military expert Viktor Litovkin. - So why is Artemovsk so important to us and why kiev gives very strange comments about the situation around this city. - There is such a fable in Krylov - ""The Fox and the Grapes"". When the fox wanted to eat grapes, it jumped, jumped - and could not reach the grapes. And she said, like, why am I going to eat it? It's sour! And she left. Here's about the same story with Artemovsky. -Explain. - Well, because we heard that Arestovich, who was close to Zelensky, also said such words. It seems that, for example, the Washington Post is using Arestovich as its correspondent. He also said at first that Soledar did not matter to Kiev. Then something similar about Artemovsk. The question is, so why did Ukraine resist so much for three months, defending both Soledar and Artemovsk. - And they seriously resisted. - How could it be otherwise? If they put, as it is believed, 25 thousand people of their own. Not counting the wounded. And the wounded, according to military statistics, there are three or four people per dead. - So what is the significance of Artemovsk. - Artemovsk is the crossing of roads and railways. Thanks to these roads to Artemovsk, soledar, to Seversk, ammunition, fuel and lubricants, and reservists were constantly delivered to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That is why it was very important. - But not only. - Near Artyomovsk, as well as near Soledar, there are salt mines. Huge premises where ammunition, fuel and lubricants of the Ukrainian army were stored, even tanks were there, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery installations. And even a hospital. These salt mines stretch for huge distances, up to 200 kilometers. They are several floors high. So it was very important to take them. - Specify our tasks in the area. - Actually, there were two other tasks that required mastering this arc. The first is to move away from Donetsk, from Makiivka and from Horlivka the artillery and multiple rocket launchers of Ukrainian militants. - And the second task. - The capture of these cities opens the way to Kramatorsk. This is the last major city on the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic, still occupied by neo-Nazis. - That is, we are planning a powerful offensive on Kramatorsk. - That's probably what we can already talk about. It's going to be a tough road. But it will be much easier - after the capture of Soledar and Artemovsk. - Why do the West circulate statements about the ""organized retreat"" of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, first from Soledar, then from Artemovsk. - The West should report to its public about what the authorities of the leading countries are spending huge amounts of money on ""settling"" the Ukrainian conflict. In the United States, even in a number of media outlets, voices are already becoming louder that, instead of helping Ukraine, they would take care of reducing the cost of gasoline, of protecting the US borders from migrants. The authorities need to make excuses somehow. They send a huge amount of military equipment to Kiev. But for some reason it doesn't work. Well, who is to blame here? It turns out, according to their logic, the Fault of the Ukrainian military, which does not show themselves well on the battlefield. And now we Americans, they say, have to suffer with their supply and training. READ ALSO.

In the Kupyansk direction, the strikes fell on the units of two brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region and in the LPR. There, the Ukrainians lost at least half a company. In the Krasnolimansk direction, units of three brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were defeated. The attack of the assault groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at Chervona Dibrova was also repulsed. In the Donetsk direction, the troops developed success in the direction of the northern outskirts of the city of Artemovsk and the Sol railway station. There, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 80 fighters. And in general, they began to speculate that ""Artemovsk does not matter much."" Well, of course, Kharkiv and Kiev have. Armin Papperger, head of the arms concern Rheinmetall, believes that the repair and preparation of Leopard 2 tanks for Ukraine will take at least a year. According to him, even if Berlin decides to send the most serious combat vehicles to Kiev in the near future, the company will not be able to do this until the beginning of 2024. According to the head of Rheinmetall, now the company has about 110 tanks of the Leopard type, while only 22 of them are combat vehicles - this is the Leopard 2. And the company cannot start preparing tanks in advance - after all, it costs millions of euros and is impossible without the appropriate state order. Earlier it was reported that London officially announced the delivery of Challenger 2 tanks to Kiev. How much scrap metal they have left on the move after pathetic visits to Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria... Dmitry Rogozin, head of the group of military advisers and the center ""Tsar's Wolves"", said that the combat robotic platform ""Marker"" will be tested in the SVO zone. According to Rogozin, the Marker was successfully tested on the protection of the Vostochny cosmodrome. There he controlled the perimeter and ensured its security. Well, now such machines will have to undergo a baptism of fire in the Donbass. The robot is a joint project of the National Center for the Development of Technologies and Basic Elements of Robotics of the Federal Research Institute and the Ngo ""Android Technology"", which previously developed the anthropomorphic robot ""Fedor"". Well, beat first, Fedya. The Wall Street Journal is sad that the West may face a shortage of ammunition in the coming summer against the backdrop of military assistance to the Kiev regime. At the same time, according to the WSJ, Moscow, in turn, will achieve the expansion of production in the field of armaments. Experts of the American edition state: ""The Ukrainian army consumes shells supplied by the West twice as fast as they are produced in the United States and NATO countries. Maintaining this pace, Kiev can reduce American and European reserves to a critical level in six months. "" This is confirmed by specialists of the military industry. There is a consoling symptom - Kiev may not be able to maintain such a rate of spending shells - there will simply be no one. Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the LPR, said that the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened more than two thousand cases because of crimes against residents of Donbass by Ukrainians. And he specified: ""Such a number of criminal cases have been initiated against more than 600 Ukrainian nationalists."" At the same time, more than 118 thousand residents of the region were recognized as victims in these cases. If someone thinks that crimes have a statute of limitations, then they are mistaken. The Defense Ministry reported that the SBU planned to blow up a granary in the village of Karaichne in the Kharkiv region to discredit Russia as part of a ""grain deal"". This provocation by the SBU is aimed at accusing Russia of creating a ""food shortage"" in Ukraine. There is evidence that about 30 representatives of the Ukrainian special services arrived in this settlement and have already mined granaries, after the explosion of which Russia will be accused of ""deliberate destruction of grain reserves in Ukraine"" and ""provoking hunger."" And then the Western media will traditionally demand a ""tough response from the world community."" By the way, where are the materials of the investigations into the ""victims of Russian aggression"" in Bucha and Izyum? A man in military uniform threatened to detonate a grenade in one of the supermarkets of the Ukrainian capital. As reported by the local newspaper ""Klymenko.Time"" with reference to eyewitnesses, this ""warrior of light"", who confused the front line with the deep rear, broke into a supermarket, which is located near the central railway station of Kiev. Arriving representatives of the special services, after much persuasion, convinced the heroic grenade thrower to give up the ammunition. He was then taken to the police headquarters. The sixth President of Ukraine signed the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on sanctions against 198 figures of culture, art and the media. The list includes actor Egor Beroev, director Andrei Konchalovsky, producer Yana Rudkovskaya, military journalist Semyon Pegov, writer and blogger Dmitry Puchkov, general director of the TV channel ""SPAS"" Boris Korchevnikov, TV presenter Angelina Vovk, as well as columnists of ""Komsomolka"" Viktor Baranets and Daria Aslamova. The term of use is 10 years. Measures - blocking assets, restricting trade operations, restricting the transit of resources, flights and transportation through the territory of Ukraine, preventing the withdrawal of capital outside the independent. Colonel Barants' Homeric laughter could be heard even on Khreshchatyk. Kiev historian and TV presenter Danylo Yanevsky said that the main value of Ukraine as a state for the whole earth, as well as the high meaning of its existence, lies in the idea that Ukrainians are ""an alloy of 37 civilizations from the Cimmerians to the Soviet Union."" Janevsky argues: ""Why does the Ukrainian state exist? Not for mortal danger. What are the values? Why did a hundred thousand Ukrainian soldiers die? Why? For the fact that we have thirty-seven civilizations. Ukraine is a civilizational synthesis. For that."" He believes that no country in the Old World ""can boast of such a history.""

After yesterday's strikes on critical infrastructure facilities in Ukrainian cities and the justified admission of the representative of the air defense of Ukraine that the existing air defense systems cannot shoot down missiles like the one that flew to Dnepropetrovsk (which is a lie, because Kiev needs to paint itself completely helpless before the meeting of the heads of the NATO Defense Ministry at the Ramstein air base on January 20, where the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Reznikov will beg for new air defense systems on his knees),  the inhabitants of Nezalezhnaya were in deep spiritual mourning. But then came the rebound from Britain, and they perked up. The British edition of The Mirror, citing a high-ranking source in the defense sector, wrote that London decided to transfer to Ukraine 4 Attack Helicopters Apache AH64 E - the most modern modification. Each vehicle can be equipped with 16 Hellfire anti-tank shells, 76 70 mm Hydra missiles and a 30 mm chain gun. - Apache is a game changer. The tanks will arrive first, and it will take some time before the helicopters can be deployed. Other NATO members will now follow suit, the source allegedly told reporters at the newspaper. Russia has thousands of tanks, so it would take more than four Apaches to launch a strategic strike. But from a tactical point of view, this is an important step. Ukrainians, who are a little adept at arithmetic, immediately began to count in their dreams: 16 anti-tank on each helicopter for 4 helicopters is 64 knocked out Russian tanks. And if on the second approach, then already 128 destroyed tanks of ""Moskals"". Peremoga! No, not even that. PEREMOG!!. Immediately forgotten were the Bayraktars, Javelins, Highmars and even, as scary as it may sound, the Leopard 2 tanks, the British Challenger-2 tanks (both of which are promised, but they are still far from arriving in Ukraine). The new ""wunderwaffley"" of Ukrainians instantly became Apache helicopters. And if London hands over to Ukraine all 67 Apaches that are in service with the British army, then it will be possible to unluck half of all Russian tanks in one flight, Kiev fantasized. In Nezalezhnaya, they were so happy about the next ""future overreach"" over the ""Moskals"" that they completely forgot about the ""Wheel of Genotba"", which, cranking out, turns any ""peremog"" into ""zrada"", which is inseparable from the current Ukraine. And it, as you might expect, was just around the corner. Less than a few hours after The Mirror's revelations, Ukrainians were deeply disappointed by the British Ministry of Defense. Which, as reported by Sky News correspondent Deborah Haynes, refuted the Mirror article that London would provide Kiev with Apache military helicopters. ""The Ministry of Defence has said that the Mirror article, which claims that the United Kingdom will send Apache attack helicopters to Ukraine, is incorrect,"" Haynes wrote on Twitter. Less than an hour after that, the newspaper's website had already deleted an article about providing helicopters to Ukraine. What a holiday Ukraine was robbed of. It is difficult to imagine what will happen, what kind of mourning will reign in Independence, if Berlin does not approve the transfer of 10-12 Leopard-2 tanks to Kiev by Warsaw. Duda, of course, promised them to Zelensky, but since the tanks were bought from Germany, it is the Scholz government that must issue this permit. Come on, Olaf, don't let me down. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4706552/,Alexander KOTS,2023-01-16,"Ukraine is hastily moving troops, Russia is leading to a general battle: The situation on the frontline has changed",Voenkor Kots said that Russia can take the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the cauldron near Artemovsk after the capture of Soledar,"Military KP.RU Alexander Kots analyzed the latest events in the Donbass in his author's program on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda. The commander of the joint group of Russian troops in the SVO zone was Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff. Previously, this position was held by Sergei Surovikin, commander of the Aerospace Forces. And that's what hooked me. From the very beginning of the special operation, all its planning is the General Staff, this is Gerasimov. At the same time, the very concept of the ""Joint Group of Forces"" and its commander appeared only in October 2022. Then Surovikin appeared, who inherited a very difficult situation. It is clear that he could not take and deploy the troops, depleted, and go on the offensive. Surovikin faced a difficult task - to stabilize the front and pour the first forces mobilized into combat formations. It didn't go smoothly everywhere. Where there is an enterprising commander, where he understands that with these people he should perform a combat mission, everything is in order there. They try to dilute the mobilized with fighters who have fought, who can pass on their experience, teach something, tell them somewhere. But, unfortunately, such enterprising commanders are not everywhere. Today we hear the story of how the mobilized were transferred from prepared positions to unprepared ones, where there is frozen water in the trenches, there are no bourgeois. But, having traveled across the entire contact line, I argue that there are orders of magnitude more positive examples than negative ones. Let's return to the ""castling"" in the command of the SVO. After all, Surovikin was not completely independent, he still coordinated decisions with the General Staff. And sometimes a situation could arise when Surovikin wants one thing, and the General Staff tells him: no, let's do it differently. And it turned out to be a situation of dual power. And now the final decision rests with the Chief of the General Staff, he is engaged in military operations. Surovikin, apparently, will be an emissary of the commander of the SVO ""on the ground"", in the troops. Because the Chief of the General Staff is unlikely to be constantly in the combat zone, and Surovikin will be his right hand. Whether this is a demotion or an increase, it does not matter whether anything actually changes in the system of military decision-making, it's just that now Gerasimov will bear full responsibility for the course of the SVO. If we have any successes, he will be the father of these successes, if we have problems, there will be no one to blame but him. In this regard, we have a sense. Officially, we were informed that the personnel changes are due to the fact that the tasks of the special operation will expand. I do not think that these will be geographical expansions, at the expense, for example, of Belarus. Although we see that immediately after the appointment of the Commander of the Ground Forces Oleg Salyukov as another deputy commander of the Joint Group of Forces in the special operation zone, he arrived in Minsk. Perhaps this is part of the Chief of the General Staff's plan for this winter campaign. Because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot but react to this. He cannot ignore the transfer of our units to Belarus. Part of the reserves that could be used in the offensive in the South, Kiev is simply forced, according to the laws of military science, to transfer to the North. That is, Ukraine is easing its pressure in the Donbass by stopping the hypothetical threat from Belarus. And I hope we should take advantage of that. According to Soledar, Kiev is now in the ""acceptance"" stage. Ukrainian military journalist Butusov reports that the city is actually lost. But the mouthpiece of Zelensky's office, Arestovich, has not yet explained to the audience why this is a ""peremoga"" (victory in Ukrainian). Can the Armed Forces of Ukraine counterattack Soledar? Yes, but we understand that for this they need serious forces, they need to remove them from somewhere. There are no fools sitting in Kiev, but there is a confrontation between Zelensky's PR and the military thought of the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny. If the former wins, there will be a bloody and unsuccessful attempt to recapture the city. If the latter, Ukraine will accept the loss of the city. In any case, Soledar fulfilled his role both for our troops and for Kiev. We ground a huge amount of the enemy's manpower in this meat grinder, inflicting a defeat comparable to Mariupol. And Ukraine, under this noise, sought out new types of weapons from the West – Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard tanks. Let's not be kidding. The more tanks they put, the greater the problem it will be for us. Yes, these tanks were used by the same Turkey in the Syrian conflict against the ""Islamic state"" (the organization is banned in the Russian Federation). And ISIS burned these tanks quite successfully. That is, these are not some invincible machines that will overwhelm our defenses. No. But they, of course, can drink us blood. What's after Soledar? Obviously, we will continue to put pressure on Artemovsk (Bakhmut). This is a very important node in the defense of Donbass. One of the most important. In fact, now he is already with the release of Soledar taken by us in pincers. We must reach the highways that lead to Kramatorsk and Slavyansk, that is, we cut off all the remaining supply routes to Artemovsk. That's a big boiler. After Artemovsk, we are already on the axis from Avdiivka to Slavyansk, where, probably, the general battle will take place. I think we're too liberal with them. Look at Zelensky. If he wanted to, he deprived the citizenship of the one he considered necessary. You can do this according to the Constitution, you can't – you can take and take away passports from Medvedchuk and his comrades. He wanted to - right on Christmas night he deprived the citizenship of 13 Orthodox priests, not looking back at all at any reaction of the West, what human rights defenders will say there, etc. We understood everything about this West very well. This West is now working to destroy Russia. Including the hands of hangers-on, who took place as creative personalities, accumulated their capital thanks to our country, and now from a safe distance they pour mud on my homeland. At the same time, the same Grebenshchikov says that ""it is impossible to deal with these cannibals, they are crazy, crazy, they staged a massacre in the center of Europe."" Listen, you remember playing guitar for Mikheil Saakashvili, who killed Russian peacekeepers with a tank with direct fire. For some reason, you do not consider him an ogre who unleashed a war in the center of Europe. Therefore, it seems to me that it is possible to apply strict measures to traitorous artists, to deprive them of awards, to create an atmosphere in society when it will become unprofitable for managers-hapugs, owners of nightclubs to invite some Valery Meladze to a corporate party.

Moreover, back in 2019 (after the publication of my book ""Special Operation Crimea-2014""), Kiev blacklisted me from the Myrotvorets website, where I was listed among ""terrorists, separatists and their accomplices."" And now to be on this new list among the same almost 200 Russian fellow citizens who oppose the criminal Kiev regime (and we have tens of millions of them!) is an honor for me. So, my contribution to the fight against this regime is noticed by the enemy. It's gratifying and inspiring. My weapon is not an assault rifle or a grenade, my weapon is a word. Printed in a book or in a newspaper, said on radio or television. And here you are on this stupid list just because you think differently than Zelensky or Arestovich. They managed to close the mouth of dissidents in Ukraine, and they will never shut up me and my like-minded people. For it is about as useless as if you were trying to block the Dnieper with a noodle or a mop to block the sun. Do you want to laugh at this Kiev foolishness? Sanctions, for example. involve blocking assets, restricting trading operations. My ""asset"" was once an old hut in the Kharkiv region, which after the death of my parents and brothers, relatives sold for a penny. I do not conduct any ""trade operations"" in Ukraine, except that 10 years ago (passing to Moscow) I bought a good shmat of lard and a bottle of strong moonshine on the Kiev Bessarabian market. I do not withdraw any ""capital from Ukraine"" because I do not go there and do not work. And I cannot be deprived of the state awards of Ukraine, because I simply do not have them. And that's right – on the entire list of sanctions measures. So why this formidable, but absolutely useless sanction stupidity? Clearly, it comes from the mental insufficiency of those who gave rise to it. Whose mind is clouded by malice. Some former colleagues and Fellow Ukrainians (including those who shouted ""Moskalyak to Gillyak!"" on the Maidan) in conversations on the phone or in correspondence by e-mail, I was repeatedly reproached by the fact that I had ""betrayed"" my small homeland.

""I received terrible footage on January 14 from relatives of captured Russian servicemen Vladislav Kovalenko and Pyotr Krikunov,"" Moskalkova wrote in her Telegram channel. - From unknown accounts, anonymous inhumans show mothers the abuse of their sons and threaten to kill them if they do not receive a ransom. The Commissioner called on her Ukrainian counterpart, the UN Committee against Torture, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Committee of the Red Cross to immediately demand from the Ukrainian side compliance with the Geneva Convention of 1949, which prohibits the use of torture, violence and acts degrading to human dignity. ""I am also preparing an appeal to the Chairman of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation A. I. Bastrykin,"" Moskalkova wrote. For some reason, it seems that the consequences will be only from the last of the mentioned appeals. The Polish state decided to lavish itself on the children of Polish mercenaries who died during the fighting in Ukraine. For them, payments from the state budget of Poland in the amount of 2,000 zlotys ($ 400) per month are provided. This was reported by the newspaper Rzeczpospolita. According to journalists, such a decision on this issue was made by the Prime Minister of the Republic Mateusz Morawiecki. Moreover, the money will be paid until the child reaches the age of majority or until the end of school education. For example, the usual payment to Polish families for each child is 500 zlotys per month, four times less. By the way, in December, a bill was submitted to the Sejm of Poland that will exempt Polish citizens serving in the armed formations of Ukraine from February 20, 2014 without the appropriate permission of the Polish authorized bodies from criminal liability. Children of the Ukrainian military can only dream of such care. New trends in the Ukrainian labor market simply perfectly illustrate the attitude of the male population of the country to the mobilization that has become permanent in Ukraine. After the government ordered employers to hand summonses from military recruitment offices to employees, company executives were faced with the reluctance of men to officially find a job. According to the Ukrainian resource ""Strana"", several entrepreneurs told its journalists about it at once. - After the new year, we announced a set of drivers in the state. Faced with the fact that some of those who responded say - we do not want to get an official job, so as not to receive summonses later, said one of these employers. - They say that they can only work unofficially. And even the issue of calculating the length of service to receive a pension does not really concern them. Which is quite logical, since they get the living. As reported by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, since February, Israel has stopped paying monthly allowances to Ukrainian refugees. The reason is trivial - the expiration of the temporary decree authorizing these payments and the lack of money for these expenses. Even in December, the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration was unable to fully pay these benefits due to a funding shortfall of NIS 20 million ($5.9 million). Therefore, the Ministry does not intend to extend the order after the expiration of the program. Well, there are no shekels, so they agree to dollars. Or the euro. Aren't they? Well, you're so impoverished. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak decided to send four Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, and after a while they will be joined by eight more tanks. Unless, of course, those first four are still intact and combat-ready by then. The Challenger 2 tank is unique in a number of parameters that are not always in its favor. This is the heaviest tank in the world today, its weight is 62.5 tons - which affects the speed of the tank and its maneuverability on the battlefield. In addition, it is the only modern tank with a rifled gun (120 mm), which excludes the launch of ATGMs through the gun. But most importantly, the Challenger 2 is the only tank in the world in which the basic configuration has a system for cooking and heating food for the crew. However, something suggests that the crews of the Challenger 2 and without the pizza heated in the tank turret will be very hot in Ukraine. Venezuelan President Maduro in his speech at a meeting of the National Assembly of the Republic proposed to create a bloc of allies of Russia and China in Latin America. - I spoke about this on the phone with the leaders of Brazil, Colombia, with the President of Argentina. A special time is coming to unite the efforts and paths of Latin America and the Caribbean in order to get closer to creating a powerful bloc of political forces, an economic power that will talk to the world,"" said Maduro, who is confident that the bloc with Russia and China can contribute to the onset of a multipolar world. The Budapest Szazadveg Center announced the results of its sociological study, which tried to find out the opinion of the population about who is to blame for the energy crisis that has covered Europe. According to the study, the majority of the population in the EU countries is inclined to think that the actions of the European Commission led to the current disastrous situation. More than 80% of Germans are sure of this. In other EU countries, the majority of the population thinks similarly, but there are also supporters of other answer options. But the three countries stand out. ""Greeks, Croats and Germans are the least divided on this issue. In these countries, 86% and 85% of respondents believe that the actions of Brussels caused the energy crisis,"" the study says. Moreover, recently this indicator (the guilt of the EC under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen) has increased in all three countries. As they say, you can fool one for a long time, not for a long time for everyone, but for a long time for everyone – it's impossible. - Head of the State Security Department of Lithuania Darius Jauniškis said that all Russians and Belarusians are a potential threat, because even among the representatives of the opposition there are ""recruited by the Belarusian KGB. There are not one, not two, and not even three."" And it's the same with the Russians. - The Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre abandons the works of Russian classics and removed Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. Instead, they will show performances about the beautiful Lithuanian princess and the ballet ""The Trial"" based on the eponymous work by Kafka. - The Estonian Rescue Board dismissed an employee for supporting a Russian special operation in Ukraine, as ""approving statements"" about the SVO were found in the employee's accounts on social networks.

But, as it turned out, this additional aid for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, even together with molfars and witches, was not enough. And then the Ukrainians called for help all the power of nature and the animal and plant world. Somewhere in the beginning of the summer, a whole wave of reports took place in the Ukrainian media that somewhere in a patriotic beekeeper patriotically raised by him bjols (bees) ""clamped the occupiers to death."" The coordinates of the apiary turned out to be a military secret, and therefore where exactly this happened remained a mystery. However, bees were only the beginning of the struggle of the Ukrainian fauna with the ""aggressor state"". The next to fight the Moskals were no, not the wolves. And the hares. Grey long-eared, which are a symbol of cowardice, showed unprecedented courage and, although they themselves could hardly do anything, acted as baits. It was in this capacity that they brought under the death-bearing targeted fire of Ukrainian snipers a mysterious unit of the Russian military. And here is a new example of patriotism on the part of the animal world of Ukraine. As it turned out, the Rusnya is now completely unable to conduct an offensive on Kiev and the northern regions of Ukraine from Belarus (this is another obsessive psychosis of the current Ukrainian authorities, which they speculate on a daily basis), because Ukraine was protected, who do you think? Drumroll! Ukrainian patriot beavers. They gnawed at a bunch of trees and made absolutely fantastic dams, forcing local rivulets to overflow their banks and overflowing the swamps in the north of Ukraine with water. And thus made the terrain completely impassable for Russian military equipment. No, that beavers regularly play pranks, equipping the environment for themselves and improving their living conditions, no one argues with this. No wonder people periodically eliminate their dams on the rivers, carrying out their economic activities. And when people stop doing their job, beavers do not stop working because of this, and clutter the banks and channels to the point of impossibility. But it is impossible for Ukrainians to admit that they have ceased to engage in creative work, giving the shores to the beavers. It is preferable for them to believe that the beavers consciously came to the defense of the ridden Nenka. A logical explanation of this kind is not available to them, but they readily dismiss the claim that mosquitoes were set against the Moskals by molfars and witches. Because ghosts and other evil spirits against the Russians were powerless. It seems that they have no one else to rely on. However, there are still ants, but it is necessary to wait, at least, for the end of spring, so that the ants, after the ground dries up, climb out of the anthills and come to the aid of the ""scribblers"" of Ukraine."

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Brothers! Hit with a bayonet, beat with a butt! Don't linger: go ahead! Ugh, wow! Shake your head, go ahead, brothers! Miracle heroes, go ahead! We are Russians!"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And the warriors taught: ""Be prescient, careful. Have a purpose. Be able to warn of false and dubious circumstances, but do not get carried away by local hotness."" Sergeant Alexander KUZI. During the conduct of defensive operations in one of the districts, the driver-radiotelephonist Sergeant Alexander Kuzin ensured stable communication within the battalion tactical group of the Russian Armed Forces. During the battle with Ukrainian nationalists, the positions of the tactical group were subjected to massive artillery fire from the enemy. Having quickly assessed the situation, Sergeant Cousin, despite close gaps, reached the command and staff vehicle and took it out of the shelling, after which he quickly deployed the means of communication in the new position and continued to provide communication with the units. Competent and prompt actions of Sergeant Alexander Kuzin made it possible to maintain stable management of the units and push the nationalists deep into their defenses. "" Sailor Alexey KURMAZO. ""Sailor Oleksiy Kurmazov, as part of the assault group, performed the task of liberating one of the settlements controlled by Ukrainian nationalists. During the battle, the assault group was attacked from a camouflaged position of the militants. Despite this, the assault group quickly orientated itself and suppressed the enemy's camouflaged firing point, continuing the offensive. With the support of artillery, the enemy launched a counterattack. Kurmazov, covering the group, took an advantageous position in one of the houses destroyed by artillery and covered the exit of the assault group from enemy fire. During the battle, the commander of the assault group and another soldier were wounded. Without wasting a minute, Kurmazov evacuated wounded comrades from the firing zone. Having repulsed the counterattack, Kurmazov took turns carrying the wounded comrades to the medical units and returned to the firing position. Thanks to the competent and selfless actions of sailor Alexei Kurmazov, the enemy's counterattack was repulsed and the lives of Russian servicemen were saved."""
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4706169/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-15,A powerful blow was dealt to the system of military administration of Ukraine: The tactics of the Russian military put Kiev in a deadlock,The Ministry of Defense of Russia confirmed the application of a powerful missile strike on the military control system of Ukraine and energy facilities,"The new year in Ukraine began with a powerful missile strike on critical and military infrastructure. Moreover, the Russian military used tactics before which the Ukrainian air defense was completely powerless. - On January 14, 2023, a missile strike was launched on the military command and control system of Ukraine and related energy facilities. All assigned objects are affected. The purpose of the strike has been achieved, - the press service of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the morning of January 15. First, on the morning of January 14, several explosions suddenly sounded in Kiev and Kharkiv. At the same time, neither the air alert was announced in the capital of Ukraine, nor the air defense did not work. Alarmed residents of Kiev and the region tried to calm down the head of the Kiev OVA Kuleba (the namesake of the Foreign Minister Of Ukraine), who said that it was allegedly just an object of the capital's infrastructure that caught fire. Kievans, looking at one of the craters 20 meters in diameter and 10-12 meters deep, were surprised by the destructive power of their ""air conditioner"" and decided not to believe Kuleba. As a result of these first strikes, not a single person not only killed, but also wounded among the local residents did not appear. From which we can draw an almost verified conclusion - if the Ukrainian air defense does not work, then civilians do not die. It is noteworthy that in Ukraine they immediately began to discuss why the Russians hit so accurately and powerfully. Zelensky's staff propaganda analysts, who tried to explain that the Moskalis had struck with S-300 missiles, were sent immediately far and for a long time. After conferring, the society decided that either the Daggers or the Iskanders had arrived. Supporters of the Daggers were later ridiculed because the air raid alert was not announced, and this is immediately done as soon as the carrier of this type of MiG-31 missile takes off from the airfield. It's like a conditioned reflex in Independence. We are now raising only one such MiG, and an air raid alert is immediately announced in Ukraine. And then the air raid alert was just announced. And the city and regional administrations began to scare the population, driving it into bomb shelters, that in Russia as many as 22 ""strategists"" took off from airfields, which can carry up to a hundred missiles in total. And several ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which can carry ""Kalibr"", went to the Black Sea. It was announced that the missiles are flying throughout Ukraine, and the Ukrainian air defense is also beginning to work in all regions. That's where the people of Ukraine got really worried. - We are asked to go down to the shelter, since a massive missile raid works PPO (air defense), but we are not afraid of the Russians, they do not hit us (civilians). But our PVOshniki can easily ambush, that's yes, - wrote a sensible author of one Ukrainian (but pro-Russian) Telegram channel. And like looking into the water. The first victim of the Ukrainian air defense was an apartment building in Dnepropetrovsk. But, as it turned out, the ""cunning and treacherous Russians"" launched false targets in the first wave to open the Ukrainian air defenses. The Ukrainian PVOshniki who came to such conclusions were ordered to silence all operating radars and not to unmask their positions. And everything seems to be quite logical - why spend precious ammunition on target targets, and even show your positions. But as soon as they had time to carry out the order there, at that time it was no longer the target traps that arrived, but real missiles in the second wave. Kyiv and region, Kharkiv and region, Odessa and region, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv Ternopil, Zhytomyr, Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Vinnitsa. Explosions sounded throughout Ukraine, which had not been heard in many cities for a long time, and electricity immediately began to be turned off. And, without any schedules. Now Ukrainians should probably remember the founder of the ""Peacemaker"", the Ukrainian Nazi Anton Gerashchenko: ""Thanks to our partners, the sky over the capital has become even safer. Ukraine is gradually moving towards the construction of its own protective dome."" He said this at the end of October in support of the words of the mayor of Kiev, who said on October 28 that Kiev received new air defense systems that will protect the capital of Ukraine. Already other systems are standing, and even newer ones are promised, and the energy structure of Ukraine as a result of the strikes of Russian missiles and drones is all shivering and squirming. So one memory will soon remain of her. Moreover, the Russian military can use new tactics every time, putting the air defense of Ukraine in a deadlock every time. But Zelensky's team will be able to come up with something every time to explain why the Moskals once again succeeded. This time, it was explained to ordinary citizens that the air defense was useless, because ""in the fog the missile is very poorly visible."" - Well, son, did your lyakhs help you? – in a similar situation, the old kozak Taras Bulba asked his wayward son. How it ended with this son, I hope everyone remembers. And who says that at the present stage of history everything should end differently?"

Assault detachments with airborne troops, supported by aviation, missile troops and artillery, entrenched themselves on the northern outskirts of Artemovsk and the Sol station. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he positively assesses the course of Russia's military special operation in Ukraine. According to him, there is a ""positive trend"" during the CBO. Putin also stressed that Russian fighters will be pleased with good results in the SVO zone more than once. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed a powerful missile strike on the military control system of Ukraine and energy facilities. Recall that from February 24, 2022, the Russian Armed Forces are conducting a special operation in Ukraine to protect the civilian population of Donbass from genocide by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4706143/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-14,"""January is a very sad month for Russophobes"": Vladimir Rogov assessed the situation in the SVO zone",Vladimir Rogov told what to expect from the special operation in Ukraine in January 2023,"About what is now happening in the Zaporozhye region, on Radio ""KP"" told a member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region, the chairman of the movement ""We are together with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov. - Vladimir Valeryevich, look, Russia's permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzia said that Russia is ready for a scenario in which the goals of the military operation in Ukraine would be fulfilled peacefully, as a result of diplomatic negotiations. His first deputy in this post, Dmitry Polyansky, confirmed that Russia did not have the task of destroying Ukraine, the goal of the WWO is to ensure the protection of human rights in the country. Are there real prerequisites for resolving the situation through diplomatic negotiations? - Russia never wanted and did not plan to destroy Ukraine. Ukraine cannot be destroyed. It's like destroying Siberia. This is the same Russian land historically. This is clear to everyone, and above all to our enemies. And Russia is ready for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. That's understandable. But the question is that the Zelensky regime is not ready, it has completely different tasks. His task is not to preserve Ukraine, especially the local population, but on the contrary - to shed blood as much as possible, to strengthen the confrontation as much as possible and lead to grief, suffering, deaths and so on. And the Zelensky regime today has a very difficult situation. Because you have to carol, begging for more weapons, more money. Because that's what it steals from. On the other hand, it is quite difficult to show a picture of success. Because there are no such successes. That's what the CIPSO is doing all sorts of stuffing on various topics: that Soledar is under control, everything is fine, a planned retreat is being prepared. They already impose outright fakes, draw some pictures in Photoshop, come up with other nonsense. - Actually, what's there now. - If we are talking about the Zaporizhzhya region, it is important that now we are undergoing changes on the front line, which can be assessed with restraint and optimism. Yes, we are waiting for the enemy's offensive in the Zaporizhzhya region, they have accumulated and continue to accumulate their forces on the Zaporozhye line of contact. Because the Zaporizhzhya LBS concerns a little bit and the Donetsk region, up to the direction of Pavlovka, Ugledar, Volnovakha, etc. And we have contact and intersection of different parts there. It is difficult to divide the zone of responsibility there, because our soldiers are doing one common thing – the Russian army, Rosgvardiya, the 1st and 2nd corps of the DPR and the LPR, now simply becoming part of the Russian army. And now we have begun to systematically destroy artillery depots, where shells for artillery and missiles for MLRS such as HIMARS, Vilkha, etc. are stored. This drastically reduces the intensity of shelling of our peaceful cities. Our reconnaissance, air defense, motorized riflemen and artillery are working smoothly. Zaporozhye LBS, Zaporozhye front - this is a very complex symphony, which plays very qualitatively and well. It's a big orchestra, in every sense. In addition to the Russian army, now we have more and more ""musicians"", which we are also very happy about. Even today, on the night of the Old New Year, our guys poured very well ""gifts"" to the militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Nazis on the Zaporozhye LBS. And there again they raised a cry for ""civilian objects"" and that ""there are no losses."" But my fellow countrymen – Zaporozhians – inform me from the field of directly opposite information about the results of arrivals. I think we should wait for the reports of the Ministry of Defense. True, Kiev's attempts to shell our cities are still ongoing. Today, early in the morning, rocket launches were launched at Melitopol and Berdyansk - the two largest cities of the Zaporozhye region in the liberated territory. But Russia's air defenses worked out all the targets in the air. And no damage has been caused to infrastructure, facilities, especially to the life and health of people. - What should we expect in January and after it. - January is a very sad month for the Russophobia regime in the southern Russian lands. This was also the case a hundred years ago, when unarmed students were sent to certain death in order to stay in power at the expense of German-Polish bayonets and interventionists. This was also the case relatively recently with the Donetsk airport. When he was already liberated from the Nazi abomination, and in Kiev they said that some other allegedly some ""cyborgs"", whom they themselves called so, are standing and holding this airport. And then they came up with the excuse that ""the cyborgs survived – the concrete did not stand."" Zelensky, by the way, used the same manual, only Zelensky could not stand it and collapsed the walls. And now everything is repeated one by one, as it was with the Donetsk airport. This is now happening with Soledar, and with Dorozhnyanka in the Zaporozhye region, and with Bakhmut, and a lot of other small settlements that have already been liberated since the beginning of this year. I think that's just the beginning of the year. God willing, for all of us it will be victorious."

Here is the loudest news of the New Year associated with a special military operation. (It was headed by chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, and the former commander is now deputy.) And, as it seems to me, now we especially need such a general's view - how do you assess these permutations, if they can be called so, in the leadership of the SVO. - First, it should be correct, as they say. - Use military terminology. - No - take these messages seriously. That is, to believe what comes from official sources, and not what is distributed in social networks. Properly track, filter all the information on this topic. As for the announced appointment of Valery Gerasimov as commander-in-chief of the entire operation, I believe that this is a trained person, he knows his business well, an already quite experienced general. Therefore, I think that he should succeed. We all expect from the new commander of the SVO a ""feat"" associated with the skillful leadership and management of troops. It is clear that after the new appointments, we are waiting for some action. Most likely, this is what our reserves were prepared for, they are concentrated somewhere in a certain place, some idea has already matured. -What. - As they say, only the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and our military leaders know this. No one knows. That's right. And he shouldn't know. Otherwise, it will be impossible to achieve the surprise factor. What will happen and how will it be?.. This should not be advertised. - But the Ministry of Defense still disseminated such information, in simple words, that a set of measures is being developed - to achieve the goals of the SVO, this is how it is in general. What it could be. - This means that reserves, human and material resources have been tightened, personnel have been equipped, and their training has been carried out. commanders are trained, everything is thought out. Then, in the name of the tasks set, second echelons are formed, in engineering terms, as they say. the ways of delivery of everything necessary have been determined. This is a whole range of measures necessary for the implementation of the decision. This, in principle, is the art of war. And what kind of decision it is – no one will tell you today. No one will tell us. And rightly so. Otherwise, a penny price will be such a decision if it becomes known to the general public. - How do you assess the fact that Soledar was released. - It's an event. Remarkable. But it's not a win. So far, the operational line of defense has not even been broken, but only the tactical zone. - How to understand. - Tactical - this is the depth of the division, if we take the very beginning, so to speak, from the border of what was behind the DPR and LPR for the period of 2014. Now, in theory, reserves should enter this breached defense zone - for the further development of the offensive, for entering new frontiers that could be beneficial for the enemy. That is, we must occupy them so that he does not have time. In the future, introducing fresh reserves, to develop an offensive to achieve the goals of the operation. This is demilitarization, denationalization of Ukraine. All of this will be resolved, it seems to me. - It may be that even before the snow begins to melt and the roads spread again, we will learn some (I mean, - good) news. -I think so. The winter campaign will yield some results. - On February 11, 1993, the title of ""Marshal of the Russian Federation"" was approved. And during all this time, it was assigned only once - to Igor Sergeyev, when he was Minister of Defense. And after Igor Dmitrievich passed away, we had a strange situation: there is a rank, but we do not have a single marshal now. Do you think it's right for an army general to command an army general? Solid army generals... Maybe in the SVO zone they still do marshal's work. - You know, the title is not the main one in this case. The main thing is skill, command professionalism. As for the command, I was a major, and I commanded lieutenant colonels. It all depends on your authority, on your professionalism, on your literacy. As for the rank of marshal- yes, it is provided for by the Constitution, it is assigned in wartime in the defense of the Fatherland. Now, yes, we are defending, liberating our Fatherland, but in order to confer the title, we must look at the results. So that it does not turn out that these stars will be there a little with an unnecessary, let's say, shade."

Repeated attempts by the enemy to disrupt the control of the brigade units were unsuccessful, thanks to the additional communication system deployed by the subordinates of Captain Gamzaev and ensuring prompt warning of the interacting troops. The professional, courageous and decisive actions of Janbolat Gamzayev and his subordinates allowed the command to quickly coordinate the actions of forces in battle, as a result of which our troops repelled the attack of the nationalists and entrenched themselves on new frontiers.

Specialists of the Military-Construction Complex of the Ministry of Defense of Russia are building a complex of buildings of the St. Petersburg Cadet Corps of the Investigative Committee of Russia. The progress of work was checked by the head of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Alexander Bastrykin and Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia Timur Ivanov. Military builders will have to restore a number of historical objects, adapting them to the needs of the future educational institution and build new facilities of the educational institution. ""An educational building with an assembly hall, a dining room, a sports complex, a hostel for 420 seats and other facilities will be built from scratch. At the same time, specialists of the Ministry of Defense of Russia are reviving the historical buildings of the Academy of the Investigative Committee in St. Petersburg (the former Military Collegium on the embankment of the Moika River),"" the Russian Defense Ministry said. The department explained that the cadets of the Investigative Committee of Russia will occupy a complex of buildings that go to the Moika River, to The Decembrists Street and the garden of the Yusupov Palace. The main building, facing the river, was built in the 1740s."

In the area of Liman of the First Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian DRG was destroyed. In this direction, the enemy's losses exceeded 50 fighters. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the artillery of the Central Military District fired at concentrations of manpower and equipment of the 71st Jäger, 80th and 95th DShB of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the 15th Regiment of the National Guard near Grigorovka, Serebryanka in the DPR and west of the village of Chervonaya Dibrova in the LPR. More than 70 fighters were killed there. In the Donetsk direction, the units of the Southern Military District, in cooperation with the paratroopers, continued the offensive. During the day, more than 60 Ukrainian servicemen, one tank, three armored fighting vehicles and six cars were destroyed. Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, said that all high-rise buildings in the town of Marinka, west of Donetsk, are controlled by Russian forces. He also noted that the Russian military meter by meter is cleaning up the territory. And he expressed hope that in the very near future Marinka will completely come under the control of the DPR. Earlier, Pushilin reported that a turning point had come in the liberation of the entire territory of the republic. According to him, Marinka almost completely came under the control of the Russian military, but the enemy managed to gain a foothold in the residential sector on the outskirts. Now the outskirts have also been cleaned up. An adviser to Zelensky's office, Arestovich, wrote a statement about leaving after the scandal because of his admission that it was the air defense of Ukraine that was to blame for the explosion in a high-rise building in Dnepropetrovsk. In this city, as ukrainian media reported on Saturday, the entrance of an apartment building collapsed. Arestovich on the air of one of the YouTube channels reported that a rocket fell on the building and exploded, which was shot down by self-propelled air defense systems. After that, the head of Zelensky's office faced a wave of criticism. Deputies of the Rada began collecting signatures for the resignation of Arestovich, and Boris Filatov, the mayor of Dnepropetrovsk, called the politician bad words and called on the SBU to check him for lice. An adviser to the head of Zelensky's office quickly retracted his words, apologized and quickly resigned. There is no doubt: Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners never miss - they aim at their own. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the IAEA, said that the organization creates permanent missions at all facilities of the nuclear power industry of Ukraine. In particular, such a mission has already been organized at the South-Ukrainian NPP. According to Grossi, representatives of the IAEA arrived in The Independent State ""to stay and help ensure nuclear security during the ongoing conflict."" He also said that ""despite all the difficulties,"" the IAEA is in Ukraine, working with the Ukrainian side: ""And now we are establishing our permanent presence here."" Well done, take a pie off the shelf. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, noted that at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he was honored to meet with Robert Habeck, Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economy of Germany. The former boxing champion in his telegram channel said that during the negotiations, further support and assistance to the independent from the Federal Republic of Germany was discussed. This, in particular, was about the transfer of weapons. ""Positive decisions have been made,"" Klitschko rejoiced. And he promised that the ""good news"" would be soon. The good ones are for whom. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, called it a disgrace to discuss the supply of armored vehicles instead of a discussion about the problems of the world economy at the World Economic Forum in Davos. So he wrote: ""What a disgrace, if not to say more rudely. There is a capacious Russian word for the same letter. The Davos forum is discussing... the supply of tanks to Ukraine."" Medvedev believes that, ""it is good that there is neither Russian nor Chinese business there today."" And he pointed out that in the Old World, probably, they expect that the ""tank coalition"" will bring ""the division of Ukraine into parts"" closer. In the Swiss Alps, the air is fresh, there is a wind of my hopes... Former coach of the Russian national team, CSKA and Rubin, Leonid Slutsky commented on the transfer of Ukrainian midfielder Mykhailo Mudrik from Shakhtar Donetsk (which is based in Lviv) to London Chelsea for 100 million euros. Slutsky said: ""100 million for a player who appeared on the field in several matches in the Champions League - is it like at all?"" Chelsea are not a team for the future, they are a team for the present. A player for the future cannot be worth 100 million. As long as Mudrik is a player who just runs very well."" Mudrick's contract with Chelsea is for 8.5 years. This season, the 22-year-old midfielder scored 7 goals in 12 matches in the championship of independence. Well, in London, of course, it will blossom and begin to ozonize the air with live pounds of sterling and endless goals. Ulf Christersson, Prime Minister of Sweden, which holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union, announced the priority of supporting Ukraine for the EU countries. And he proposed to use Russian assets frozen in the West to restore the Ukrainian economy. Christersson said in Strasbourg: ""We must ensure that the Union maintains its economic, political, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine. We must ensure that Reforms continue in Ukraine on its way to joining the EU. And we must work to resolve the issues of the resumption of economic life and the restoration of Ukraine together with all our international partners."" As the famous Soviet western used to say, ""Work, Negroes, the sun is still high."" A member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region, Vladimir Rogov, said that Ukrainian troops are preparing the city of Zaporozhye for street fighting. According to him, in the suburbs of the regional center, work is underway to create fortified areas, and infrastructure facilities are mined in the city itself. Serious engineering work is underway at several factories to create shelters for militants, ammunition depots and military equipment. Rogov said that the Ukrainian military is building several lines of fortifications at once. You can bury yourself in the ground - but you can not get out of there ..."

We try to do everything so that life support tasks are in the very first place. Especially when it comes to combat work in the field. Of course,  we are talking about the provision of uniforms.

And most importantly - for the inability to win","Military officer KP.RU Dmitry Steshin returned to his small homeland, to Donetsk, which had become his native, to a city that, in spite of the enemy, living under shelling and without water. Living - here is the main word","It is indecent to go to Donetsk in an empty car. Mine was loaded under the roof, the last packets shoved in, pressing my knee. With me, the sniper ""Moskva"" returns to the front, he was released for several days into peaceful life for quadrocopters with thermal imagers - bought by kind conscientious people. They also bought for snipers special capes that hide from thermal imagers, vests with heating, working from power banks, first-aid kits and many, many necessary goods, including warming tea ""masala"" and chocolate ""Alenka"". My colleague's wife, a KP special correspondent, knitted 10 pairs of woolen socks over the holidays and put a pack of good cigarettes in each one. I'm carrying ... soap. My brother is a soap maker, he has a serious production - under 100 thousand units of products per month. My brother brewed a special antiseptic pine soap for the sanitary unit of the Vostok battalion. Therefore, the car smells strongly of pine forest on a hot summer day. Tatyana from Gomel, a listener of my stream on the KP website, handed over a 12-kilogram box of condensed milk for scout Fox and his unit to sweeten the life of the guys, and two devices for treating colds, the main trouble of the winter trenches. The devices are made in Belarus, not in China, and I am a little offended by this fact. The border with the DPR is now administrative. He opened three doors to the car, the customs officer randomly poked into a green bag: ""What is this?"". My personal belongings were there. They did not open it, they took their word for it, and we moved on – five minutes of crossing the border is a record of my last nine years in the Donbass. ""You don't recognize the city,"" Moskva told me on the way, ""he got it over the past month."" ""Moskva"" itself did not often go to Donetsk from the front line, but the changes were tracked. They're visible. It's Sunday, but the roads are empty. Revival only near hypermarkets. The center, its main geographical coordinate is Pushkin Boulevard, as extinct. In the center of the boulevard, along the alleys, people try not to walk, press against the walls. The yard of the house where I now settled was always packed with cars. ""Golden Mile"" of Donetsk, around the offices. But, after another series of shelling of the center, all clerks, by decree of the acting head of the DPR, were transferred to ""remote"", and wealthy residents of the city left themselves. And I, as it turns out, arrived. There is no water at all in the Center. ""On holidays they gave,"" the landlord, my old friend, has been telling me since I was 14. Rostislav proudly notices. - But you'll have water. And the washer will work and the toilet, and the shower. I don't believe it yet. How? But, in the kitchen there is a fantastic design. Half-ton plastic water tank. An electric pump lurks under the kitchen table, and polypropylene pipes are separated from it around the apartment. - And the water in the tank is from where. - I drove a car with a tank to the sidewalk, stretched the hose into the window. The water, by the way, is not drinkable. It's decontaminated, and nothing more. You can wash. If you save, two or three palms a day (shows the level on the tank). I feel a cultural and technical shock and at the same time pride in unbending countrymen. I touch the batteries, they are hot. It's already good. Goodbye, I tell Rostislav the good news. The entire border area near Uspenka is clogged with trucks - they carry pipes of a meter diameter, for the water pipeline. On the part of the DPR, it's the same. We have already installed a frame for a huge pumping station, they work even on Sunday. There will be water. My interlocutor's face is impenetrable. Donetsk, any changes are perceived only after the fact. I think this is a consequence of life in the city, where a shell can fly to any corner, every second. Reality has adjusted the perception of the world. And nine years is enough for flashing. Until the shell arrives, we live. I arrived, so I was lucky. Or not. I do not stay in the Center. I throw things in the apartment to at least slightly alleviate the overloaded car. Ahead of the fierce off-road of the front, I hope it is frozen. Twenty minutes drive through the city, a familiar forest plantation, carefully crawling along the frozen tank ruts and receiving a mortar shot literally above my ear. I sigh. - Again, the birthmark almost happened. As soon as I don't come to you, a mortar shoots in my ear in this forest plantation. ""Moscow"" laughs. - Not just you! According to my months-long observations, they are specifically waiting for the car to go. But, the mortar hits and hits. ""Moscow"" is quickly unloading, I see that it is in a hurry. No one is helping him – the guys are in position. Tells me to turn the car around. Ask. - Where the mortar goes. - On the fur farm in Marinka. You go, go, don't linger here. A Grad connects to the mortar and it dawns on me that there is nothing to do here unnecessarily. We hastily say goodbye. In the yard, I hide my car under the wall of the house and go to the store. I gave two thousand rubles, but I did not understand what I bought with them. A piece of sausage, a piece of cheese, two homemade pizzas, milk, bread and something for trifles. Drinking water. Prices are higher than in Moscow, and why they did not sink with the removal of borders, I sincerely do not understand. No one understands. We can say that this is a rhetorical question from all compatriots from Donbass. In the morning I woke up to arrivals, the house shook. I mechanically look at the clock – 8.40 in the morning. Presumably, ""Highrs"", several pieces, got into a shopping center on Ilyich Avenue. This avenue, the busiest highway at the entrance to Donetsk, there are even traffic jams on it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not accidentally choose such a time. I quickly pack up and leave. Drive for ten minutes, everything is nearby. There is only one outer wall left of the mall. A mangled, dust-covered Korean SUV. Nearby, an older man, with a bandaged head, on a sweater already dried blood clots - cut with glass. I ask the most important thing. - The engine is intact. - Whole, whole. It even starts. There's not much to tell my namesake. Military retired, by age and health. I was driving to work, a flash, the car crumpled, but did not turn over. Dmytro believes that Ukraine is taking revenge on Donetsk. For everything. For the fact that he once rebelled, for Soledar, for arriving at a high-rise building in Dnepropetrovsk. Although it's not our fault, but who cares on the other side of the front line? ""Revenge"" is the general opinion of all who gathered near these smoking ruins. A woman comes up to us. His name is Elena, a systems engineer, retired. - See, Press Store? I had a friend who worked in it. But, my friend is a day off today, and her shifter was late for work. And she saved herself and saved people - they usually open at 8 am. Second birthday, what can I say... But ""Pharmacy"" was not so lucky. As Muscovites talk about the weather, we discuss shelling. The Kalinin district was shelled only in the 14th year, then a long break until December last year, when the Armed Forces of Ukraine designated the Kalinin Hospital as a target. Firefighters spill water on the rubble. The ""regime of silence"" has already been announced several times, but no one has responded. On the dirty roadside are the relatives of the missing girl, she was definitely in the building. I don't even approach them, there is no strength to torture these people. Especially when there is still hope. LISTEN AS WELL. Zelensky declared war on Cheburashka (more)"

More than 30 Ukrainian servicemen were killed. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the artillery units of the Central Military District hit the forces of the 95th DShB and the 125th Brigade of Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Serebryanka and Terna in the DPR. More than 75 Ukrainian servicemen were killed there. In the Donetsk direction, the units of the Southern Military District, in cooperation with the airborne units, continued to advance. During the day, more than 50 Ukrainian servicemen, an armored personnel carrier and eight cars were destroyed in this direction. In the South-Donetsk direction, the units of the VVO inflicted a comprehensive defeat on the 65th motorized infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the stepovoye area of the Zaporizhia region and the 108th territorial defense brigade in the area of Novoselka of the DPR. Up to 30 Ukrainian servicemen were killed. In Kiev, of course, they do not know about this and report on their new peremogs. The State Bureau of Ukraine uncovered a scheme of large-scale theft of products intended for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the private enterprises was engaged in the supply of food to more than 45 military units of Ukraine. For six months of 2022, it received military contracts for more than UAH 2 billion. Only part of the supplies reached the Ukrainian military. The rest was sold through intermediaries. During 70 searches, 7 tons of products intended for resale were found, and more than 4 million hryvnias in different currencies, dozens of cars were seized, on which products were transported. But, in general, it is somehow shallow: to steal - so billions. The companies of the Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash ""Kharkivgaz"" and ""Dneprogaz"" were searched. Earlier, the Ukrainian newspaper Ekonomicheskaya Pravda reported that the two companies reported an attempted raider seizure, saying that Naftogaz of Ukraine officials tried to change the leadership of the boards of their joint-stock companies. And before that, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine imposed sanctions on businessman Firtash. The NSDC accused him of ""involvement in the supply of titanium to military enterprises of Russia."" The Ukrainian businessman denied all the charges. Control over the operators of gas distribution networks owned by Firtash has not yet been obtained. But a bad thing is not a tricky one. Sofia does not want to transfer Su-25 aircraft to Kiev through intermediaries. The Ministry of Defense of Bulgaria reported that it did not transfer to NATO countries allegedly intended for Ukraine attack aircraft. And the minister of foreign affairs of the technical government, Nikolai Milkov, also said that he knew nothing about the ""supplies"". Well, why does Kiev need combat aircraft? In order to evacuate the country's leadership to them in the near future - one at a time. The head of the president's office, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that the sixth president of Ukraine, after resolving the issue of re-exporting cars with Germany, will ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to deliver Leopard 2 tanks to the country. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Podolyak said that Zelensky would expect such a ""friendly step"" from Canada, but Germany should play a leading role in this process, since it is the owner of the technology. Podolyak noted that the German Chancellor will soon issue the necessary permission for the supply of tanks. It is not said that Ottawa, which 15 years ago purchased 82 Leopard 2 tanks from Germany, agreed to supply such armored vehicles to Kiev. To promise is not to marry. Andriy Melnyk, a former ambassador-speaker to Germany, and now deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, said that the outdated German Tornado aircraft, which Berlin is going to replace with new combat vehicles, should be given to Kiev. The Bundeswehr now has 93 Tornado multi-role combat aircraft. They will soon be decommissioned. And even if it is a rather old jet fighter, it would not interfere with Ukraine. And in general, they would not hurt a little brain. The vessel en route from Ukraine ran aground in the Bosphorus Strait on Monday, and it was closed for traffic for 10 hours. According to the Turkish TV channel Haberturk, the ship, which was coming from the independent country, ran aground near Saryer in the Bosphorus. After an intensive rescue operation, the strait was opened by evening. This is the second such incident in this section of active shipping in the last 4 months, associated with vessels that take out goods from the independent one. Something is wrong either with the captains or with the sailor. The commander of the volunteer unit of the special forces ""Troy"" Vladimir Novikov with the call sign ""Alabai"" said that as soon as the US-made M777 howitzers fail in the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they are immediately sent to Poland for repairs. Novikov said that attempts to service foreign equipment at the repair bases of Ukraine, which were set up for Soviet equipment, turned out to be ineffective. Therefore, almost all weapons that cannot be restored in Ukraine due to the high cost, or lack of personnel, or special equipment of the NATO model, are transported to Polish repair bases. And the Poles are making good money from this conflict. The Investigative Committee of Russia is investigating information about the abuse of members of the armed formations of Ukraine over our prisoners of war and the civilian population of Donbass. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation noted that information was repeatedly received about bullying by the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and nationalist formations over Russian prisoners of war, including on a national basis. The IC said: ""Investigators of the Investigative Committee of Russia will establish the circumstances of the incident, the actions of all involved persons will be given a legal assessment."" Yes, it would be better if the perpetrators did not live to see the trial. Yevhen Balitsky, the head of the Zaporizhia region, said that the liberation of the remaining territory of the region under the control of Kiev, including the regional center, Zaporozhye, could begin in April-May. Balitsky said: ""We believe that in the spring, probably, we will begin to liberate the Zaporozhye region in full. I don't think it can happen before. We know what forces are resisting us – the entire collective West."" According to the head of the region, it will not be easy with Zaporozhye itself: ""Very large events will be needed.

Give us a thousand tanks and other armored vehicles!"" – this is how Ukrainian politicians and generals beg the West for heavy weapons. Washington and London, Warsaw and Berlin, Paris and Prague have already transferred and still promise to transfer to Ukraine dozens of units (but not thousands!) of this war iron. In the spring of last year, on the orders of the White House, its NATO colonies in Europe began to supply Kiev with soviet (but marafened) old Warsaw Pact antiquities that were still capable of furying – tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers. There was a calculation that these weapons were well known in the Ukrainian army, equipped with the same armor from the Soviet era. But during the special operation, Russian troops destroyed almost 80% of Ukrainian and Western (from Soviet stocks) armored vehicles. Kiev's armored fist was bored. Therefore, Zelensky and his ministers and generals began to panic in alarm bells. Arriving in Washington, the President of Ukraine almost on his knees begged the owner of the Oval Office to give Kiev a new batch of combat vehicles. US President Joe Biden and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg threw a call to the members of the bloc to once again throw off and give Ukraine more armor. The call was answered. Well, how did the European members of the North Atlantic bloc react to it? They ""scraped the bottoms"" and handed over to Ukraine either those of their weapons that were already planned to be sent for disposal, or those that were repaired in a hurry. In other words, God is on you, that we don't care. When this equipment of retirement age hit the battlefield, and there it began to stall and break, Kiev was outraged. ""Most of the weapons supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Western countries are outdated, they simply have expired,"" said Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko. - If you want to recycle it, give it to us... In normal, peaceful times, no one would want to talk about it in such terms. But now, why not?"" And they also say that they do not look a gift horse in the teeth. The British government should provide Ukraine with 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks. This was reported in the office of prime minister Rishi Sunak. They added: ""The prime minister asked Defense Secretary Ben Wallace to go further and faster in our support for Ukraine, including the provision of tanks."" Well, what kind of beast is this - ""Challenger-2""? Let's listen to a well-known expert in foreign military equipment, military expert Viktor Murakhovsky. - This British tank in its current form has a number of critical flaws that cannot be quickly eradicated within the framework of the current platform. In particular, its outdated gun is ineffective against other modern tanks. But there is nothing to replace the Challenger, so the British are planning ""palliative"" or in another way - formal methods of modernization. In addition, the British machine is equipped with an outdated rifled gun of 120 mm caliber, and it does not allow the use of powerful ammunition when shooting at heavily protected targets. In fact, it is ineffective against most modern tanks. Challenger 2 loses not only to our 125-millimeter smoothbore guns, capable of using guided projectiles, but also to most foreign analogues. In addition, this old British vehicle does not have an automatic loader, as on our tanks, and this leads to a low combat rate of fire, especially on the move on rough terrain. Another serious problem of the Challenger is the outdated fire control system, which, for example, does not already have the usual automatic target tracking machine for modern tanks. And on all our modern cars there is such an automatic. But that's not all. The hydropneumatic suspension of the British tank also needs to be replaced, as its capabilities are at the limit in terms of tank weight. With the canopy of additional armor and equipment in combat conditions, it demonstrated poor reliability and did not provide an acceptable smoothness of the ride. Earlier, a plan for the modernization of the LEP (Life Extension Project) was developed for these British tanks, with the help of which the British hoped to solve these problems. The program involves the installation of a new smoothbore gun, a new fire control system and a more powerful engine of 1.5 thousand horsepower. However, the project has not yet been implemented. But, apparently, London decided that for Ukraine it would come down."" To the words of Murakhovsky it is worth adding that 14 old ""Challengers"" in Ukraine will inevitably require spare parts and repairs. How this problem will be solved is unknown. But it will add to Kiev's headache. So it turns out in the dry residue that there is much more ostentation, deception and populism in London's arms aid than practical meaning. Is it not because the Defense Committee of the House of Commons of the British Parliament dejectedly blurted out that ""in the event of an armed conflict with Russia, the battle of tank units is likely to end not in favor of Great Britain""? Well, the main reason for this conclusion is again called obsolete armored vehicles. The United States is going to transfer to Ukraine 50 Bradley M2A2 ODS infantry fighting vehicles, modernized as a result of Operation Desert Storm. That is, Kiev is invited to conduct a winter campaign on old IFVs, prepared for fighting in a hot climate in a desert area. And in Donbass, after all, it is not heat, not hot sands, but snow and frost. Each army likes to call its equipment ""the best in the world."" The US Army is no exception, which praises the M-2 Bradley IFV. This machine, of course, has a number of advantages over analogues, but at the same time it has several weak points that American specialists do not like to talk about. Moreover, the opinions of the military of various countries are fundamentally at odds with what overseas propaganda is trying to instill. In fact, for 35 years of being in service, despite all the attempts of the Pentagon, it was not possible to sell this combat vehicle to one of its allies. At one time, only Saudi Arabia dared to buy it. And then only as a token of gratitude for protecting the kingdom from the alleged invasion of saddam Hussein's troops. In total, about 400 Bradleys were purchased. Royal M2 took part in the battles. Again, not entirely successfully. In a relatively short period, 5 vehicles were destroyed. At the same time, Saudi IFVs after being hit by anti-tank weapons caught fire like matches. According to military experts, in fact, the losses of the Saudis in the BMP are much greater. It's just that not everything becomes public. And during the fighting in Kuwait and Iraq back in 1991, the U.S. Army lost two dozen Bradleys. American crews tried to hit enemy armored vehicles with TOU anti-tank missiles at the maximum possible range. But when the M-2s got too close to the enemy, they began to suffer losses not only from T-55 or BMP-1 tanks, but even from DShK heavy machine guns. And if we talk about the losses of the M-2 IFV in Iraq in 2003, then here the Americans lost up to 150 such machines. Faced with the fact that the Bradley was completely unadapted to the conditions of the war with the guerrillas, the American command of the occupying forces was forced to reduce the use of these IFVs to a minimum. The Pentagon has long been frantically looking for what to replace this ""best IFV in the world"" (which, of course, it does not tell the Ukrainians). US generals at one time looked at the Israeli Namer armored vehicles and the Swedish CV9035 IFV, and as part of the GCV program, they tried to start developing 84-ton (!) IFVs. But in the coming years, the replacement of the M-2 Bradley IFV is not expected. And ""riveted"" their American defense as many as 2300 pieces. ""Old men"" constantly need to be repaired, hundreds of them have long been waiting to be sent for remelting. And recycling also requires colossal funds. And the Americans, who know how to count money, decided to save money - to transfer five dozen decrepit BMPs to Ukraine. Let it ""dispose"" of these vehicles on the battlefield. Which was done with great propaganda fanfare. And happy from such ""help"" Kiev looks like a semi-wild Papuan, to whom an American trickster under the guise of gold gives tinted irons. As is often the case in a gang (say, NATO), each of its members must be anointed with the blood of common crimes. Something similar is happening with Germany. Washington and Brussels are struggling to put pressure on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, demanding that he supply Ukraine with German Leopard 2 tanks. His arms are twisted miserably, he is scolded, he is accused of betrayal, and he is of none! Spins like a scallop, but does not dare. On the one hand, the United States is pressuring, on the other - the leadership of NATO, on the third - the opposition in the Bundestag. Scholz came up with an excuse: ""The appearance of German tanks with crosses on the battlefield may cause the Russians not the best associations associated with the Second World War."" And instead of the Leopard 2, he promises to deliver 40 Marder IFVs to Ukraine. This car by today's standards is also ancient. The terms of its production ended in 1975. But, ironically, the Germans, who know how to build tanks, could not cope with the usual IFV. Marder's ""constant sores"" were the engine and transmission. As soon as the driver ""decided to give in to the heat"", high revs quickly overheated the engine, as a result of which the Marders often broke down. It took ""only"" 20 years to find the causes. And at the end of the last century, German military engineers found the reason: it turns out that metallurgists could not choose the right alloys for the engine and transmission, so Marder needs to be driven ""carefully"". But this did not suit the military. They even promised to abandon Marder, releasing the Puma IFV as a replacement. But then there was a wreck. Either the Germans lost their engineering school, or worse, but due to frequent breakdowns, they had to go back to Marder. This old man at the Bundeswehr is swamped. For Ukraine, it's just right. As for the Leopard tanks, while Scholz is pondering, Poland promised Kiev to transfer a whole company of the same German-made vehicles (of course, ""used""). And now about the Leopard 2 tank itself. Yeah, it's a pretty decent fighting machine. The basic characteristics of this ""tank cat"" are very good. Here you have the famous optics from Zeiss with a thermal imager and laser guidance, and an automatic fire control system, and an economical reliable diesel engine, and stable armor and a 120-millimeter smoothbore gun. And yet there are serious flaws. And the most important thing is weak armor. This was especially clearly shown by the use of these machines by Turkey during the assault on the Kurdish settlement of al-Bab 6 years ago (2017). Kurdish guerrillas were able to ""take out of the game"" 5 such machines. And this is by the most minimal estimates. The Kurds also voiced a figure 2 times more. Hence the conclusions: no matter how much Russia's opponents dream, the Leopard 2 is not the wunderwaffe capable of making a fundamental difference in the SVO in Ukraine. These ""cats"" are burning from the still Soviet obsolete ATGM missiles, ordinary anti-tank mines also undermine them, as well as artillery and more obsolete tanks are destroyed. And one more thing. Any modern tank without a professionally trained crew turns into an ordinary beautiful museum exhibit. To make it different, you need high-class specialists. And still, there are too many electronics in the Leopard. To put an untrained crew in the turret is tantamount to giving a tank to the enemy. The Turks were well convinced of this at al-Bab. It is possible that the same can happen to the Ukrainians near Slavyansk or Kramatorsk. The French with fanfare announced the direction of their armored vehicles to Kiev. Not modern Leclerc tanks, of course, but wheeled gun AMX-10 IFVs - a typical product of the French neo-colonial policy: developed in the 1970s for combat operations in Africa and turned out, according to military experts, completely unsuitable due to low protection and reliability, as well as poor cross-country ability. AMX-10 is not a new machine, and crews still need to be trained on it. The process of transferring tanks ""there"" (that is, to Kiev) will take two months, apparently waiting for spring. Probably because there are no stoves in these tanks. In fact, specialists qualify the AMX-10 as a French heavy armored car (or wheeled tank). How he will behave in the conditions of scattered black soil or thick snow infusion in Ukraine is completely unclear. One of the most significant weak points of the tank is the rubber wheels, which are easy to disable with a machine gun or a small-caliber gun. After that, this ""non-tank"" turns into a fixed firing point. Armored tank car - an old unit in the armed forces of France, Produced from 1976 to 1994. That is, the youngest cars are already 28 years old, and this suggests that their resource is almost exhausted. And in this case, too, you can say: ""For Ukraine it will come down""... Now it is clear why the French defense minister gets rid of them so easily. Recycling in France would cost the government more, so they give their ""second-class partners"" all the rubbish. The technical characteristics of the machine too, so-so. While there were new ones, they could move along the highway at a speed of 85 km / h. Now, most likely, the engines are already well-worn and not so agile. What they can do on rough terrain is also unclear. Perhaps this will be another Ukrainian hemorrhoids, and not equipment for real hostilities. Well, what conclusions can be drawn from all this? The first is the most obvious: the military leadership of NATO countries is using the Ukrainian conflict to write off more of the military old man and master the funds for the modernization of their own weapons. Kiev does not get a single kind of the latest Western military equipment. All are second or third class. It is obvious that such military assistance to Ukraine is a cunning way to dispose of obsolete weapons. And they pull along a bunch of other problems - the training of specialists for various types of military equipment, which requires a lot of time. Old combat vehicles need spare parts and qualified repairs. And here without well-established logistics and specialists can not do. In a combat stop, these are the most difficult tasks. And no matter what Western weapons are supplied to Ukraine (new or old), they were and will be legitimate military targets for the Russian army. After all, one of the goals of our special military operation is to make such deliveries meaningless. READ ALSO.

What's next?,Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Viktor Medvedchuk analyzed the situation in Ukraine and explained how the country can get out of the protracted crisis,"Former Verkhovna Rada deputy and ex-leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party Viktor Medvedchuk, who was recently released from Ukrainian captivity, published a program material on relations between Russia and Ukraine in Izvestia. The main thing that the politician wrote about. The West went against Russia not because it is weak, but on the contrary, because it began to achieve real success, writes Medvedchuk. ""Russia's influence is not only discouraged, but declared wrong, criminal and corrupt,"" the author says. The reason for all the current troubles, in his opinion, is colonialism in the minds of Western officials. Russia and the United States had different goals when the Cold War ended, the politician notes. We wanted a new world without wars, americans wanted world domination. This is where the thesis comes from that we can have neither political nor economic interests. Hence Ukraine is the territory of influence of the United States, NATO. Therefore, all our claims are ""groundless"" and a clear encroachment on American and NATO interests. "" Moreover, NATO's policy also crossed out the strategy of the European Union, which was engaged in the construction of a new economy. Even the first secretary general of the alliance, Hastings Ismay, without hiding, spoke about his influence on Europe. Medvedchuk also cites his words in his article. ""Keep the Soviet Union outside (Europe), the Americans inside, and the Germans in a subordinate position."" ""Within Ukraine itself, since 1991, there have been two countries: anti-Russia and Ukraine as another Russia,"" the politician writes. According to him, the thirst for a merger with the West and a break with Russia led Ukraine to the lowest economic indicators in Europe. ""Anti-Russian sentiments brought nothing but grief and poverty to Ukraine. All pro-Western nationalist movements preach poverty and misery to the Ukrainian people,"" Medvedchuk said. The West has been in charge of the anti-Russian vector in Ukraine since 2005 - from the first Maidan, Viktor Medvedchuk notes. It is then that the country begins to make a policy of hatred towards Russia as the basis of its ideology. ""At the same time, it is clearly seen that this policy has a Cold War pattern,"" the author notes. And all this was carried out under the guise of democratic reforms, which were supported by all sorts of Western and international organizations. Any politician who comes to power in Ukraine is going through an amazing transformation, Viktor Medvedchuk notes: he begins as a peacemaker, but eventually becomes a symbol of war. ""This is how Poroshenko behaved, this is how Zelensky behaves. But this is how the NATO leadership and many American and European politicians behave, ""the article says. ""Perhaps, in order to save their country, Ukrainians need to start building their democracy and open their civil dialogue without Western curators,"" to sum up. Medvedchuk. ""So, it is necessary to create a political movement from those who have not surrendered, who have not renounced their beliefs on pain of death and prison, who do not want their country to become a place of geopolitical showdown.""

Another foreign publication, the Spanish El Pais, reported that soldiers of two battalions stationed in Bakhmut (Artemovsk) abandoned their positions and went to the rear because they did not receive ammunition. Well, The Washington Post reports that the recruits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who are now being delivered to Europe for accelerated training, are urgently changing the goals of training - from the basic principles of combined arms combat, they are trying to teach them the skills of action in a large-scale offensive. About why the Kiev regime is trying to close the holes at the front with few or completely untrained fighters, whom it also refuses to properly supply, and whether those few thousand ""Rambos"", which are now being hastily prepared in the West, will help, on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda, we talked with the director of the Center for Military-Political Journalism Vladimir Orlov. - Training newly conscripted, previously untrained fighters for competent urban combat was previously a long process, how can it be ""just accelerated"". - The Americans, it seems, will still try to conduct such an intensive course of combat training with the Ukrainians, which will prepare fighters who are ""limitedly trained"" for combat operations. Yes, of course, they will be taught all the basics in a few weeks. They will be prepared for some minimal training. - To survive, or to hold positions. - The Americans have a very serious combat training in the army. It cannot be said that after their training, after their military intensive, completely unfired, inexperienced recruits will come out. That would be wrong. - The Yankees know how to train effectively in the shortest possible time. - The Americans are good at training various militants. We have seen this in various military conflicts, including in the Middle East. - But still, special training is not weeks, or even months of training. - The United States trains special operations forces well. But yes — it's not a quick process. And they take already trained marines or paratroopers there. As for the infantry, the combined arms course of combat, the Americans have not faced emergency mass training for a long time. For many years, they simply did not have such military tasks. And, by and large, they are now reclaiming these lost skills for themselves. - America is better than Europe at training the military ""quickly"". - We need to understand that Europe is, in fact, an appendage of NATO. America, as the leader of the NATO bloc, of course, drew all resources on itself. And, of course, that America's military-technical and military-training base is much better, wider than in Europe. - In the east, Kiev, thanks to these ""precocious"", will be able to accumulate sufficient forces - not only for defense, but also for a counteroffensive. - Their ""marginal norm"" has not yet been worked out. It seems that the Americans gave instructions not to organize a counteroffensive on Soledar. It was a very meaningful decision. Despite the fact that initially Ukrainian politicians said that they would fight for Soledar until the last Ukrainian. - The situation has changed dramatically in recent days. - Now the Americans have instructed Defense Minister Reznikov not to burn resources in this meat grinder. They told him to just step back. To give us the opportunity to occupy this settlement. - For what. - Now they are hastily organizing a new front line on the approach to Slavyansk, Kramatorsk. There is a certain hill there. At these commanding heights, it will be easier for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to hold this line of defense than it was in Soledar. There, in fact, they were always under fire. And the Russian artillery could effectively strike at the firing points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the expense of those reconnaissance means that were involved. - But there is still Artemovsk before Slavyansk. - Yes, now there is a question about Bakhmut. I think that an additional, second echelon of defense will also be prepared. It will also be on the commanding heights behind Bakhmut. And the approaches to Bakhmut will be under tighter fire control from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Bakhmut will be much more difficult to take than it was with Soledar. - The confrontation in Bakhmut will be solved, in many respects, by artillery. - Now the conflict is conducted by artillery means. The front on both sides is very much saturated with unmanned reconnaissance. UAVs were specially created for this. Now every firing point is under close control, and they are being hit by artillery. If you look at the nature of the losses that we have, what the enemy has, then up to 80 percent are losses from artillery fire. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4706407/,Valentin ALFIMOV,2023-01-16,Ukraine is creating a new religion - Bandero-paganism,"In a few years, it may become the main one in Kiev, where Rus was once baptized.","In early January, the whole world watched as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate was expelled from the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. The shrine was given to schismatics from Poroshenko's OCU. But Kiev is not just the mother of Russian cities, it is also the place where Prince Vladimir baptized Rus. But will Orthodoxy remain in Ukraine now? The head of the human rights center of the World Russian People's Council, Professor of the Moscow State Linguistic University Roman Silantyev said this on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"". Within minutes, our conversation took an unexpected turn. It turns out that there may soon be no Orthodoxy in Ukraine. Everything will be supplanted by a completely new religion. What it will be called - scientists have not yet decided. - Roman Anatolyevich, how to explain the seizure of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. - Kiev follows the path of the Bolsheviks after the revolution. Then the church was also separated from the state, which did not prevent them from acting in exactly the same way. A lot of parallels can be drawn. True, the methods have become even more rigid. - The persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine began when Poroshenko came to power in 2014. - Oh no. This was under Gorbachev, when the Soviet Union began to crumble. That is, somewhere in 1988 - 1989. Then the seizure of churches by the Uniates in western Ukraine had already begun, the Orthodox were expelled. And now it has become even more ""fun"" - in the country there is a whole crowd of schismatics led by the ""Poroshenko Church"", which found formal patrons in Istanbul. - What to expect next. - I am generally surprised that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has not yet been liquidated and large-scale repressions have not begun. But I think it will happen - the Bolsheviks also did not immediately begin to shoot everyone. At first, they created ""Renovationists"" - as now the ""Istanbul-Poroshenko schismatics"", they stated that there are good Orthodox Christians who are for them, for ""progress"" ... But then they were also eliminated. - And then the church is liquidated. - The Ukrainian authorities do not see Christianity as such as an ideology or a basis for Ukrainian ideology. It already has its own religion. -Which. - ""Ukrainism"". Most likely, it will be called so in our textbooks. - That's what. - It's based on neopaganism. And quite satanic in nature. So if, God forbid, everything works out for them and they still last 10-20 years there, then they will have esoteric Nazism. Christianity will be pushed out of the elites. - Simple paganism is a set of gods - Perun, Odin, Yarilo... And what is neopaganism. - It differs from the traditional one in that it is completely fictional. It is based on fantastic works that are passed off as historical sources. - The same myths about the ""ancient Ukies"" that dug up the Black Sea. - Well, we laughed at that. And there it went into the school curricula. That is, some of our contemporaries come up with a completely unrealistic, fantastic history of their ancestors and form a new identity from scratch. - Where did that come from. - It began in the Soviet period - stories about the unique Ukrainian people, that they were almost the first to create a civilization on the planet. We also had this, but, thank you, they did not allow us to enter universities or schools. And they allowed it. As a result, in Ukraine, pseudohistory eventually became dominant. This is clearly seen in the propaganda, which does not use Christian symbols, but pagan ones. Magic in full growth. Here is a regiment of nationalists ""Azov"" (a terrorist organization banned in Russia. - Ed.) conducted a ritual of burning their comrades in a boat ... This is how a new, inherently anti-Christian, religion is formed. - It's certainly not about love. - It's a religion of hate. Her whole fuse is against the Moskals, who must be destroyed, because without this it will be impossible to live normally. This is the cult of power, the cult of warriors - they are trying to borrow it from the Vikings. This is already clearly visible in the Ukrainian army. The army elite does not hide their views. The head of their armed forces walks around with Hitler's and pagan symbols. And it's going to go to everybody else pretty quickly. As in the Third Reich, where the enthusiasm for neopagan occultism went from the elite, and then began to spread to other segments of the population. Christianity will be supplanted and at some point will remain only at the level of rural parishes. And the country's leadership will no longer be Christian. - But Ukraine was still considered a very churched country. - On the one hand, this is a plus, on the other hand, there is an ultra-high percentage of schismatics and sectarians. And all these neopagan sects were massively present. This permeated culture, literature, even science. That's how the new religion ""Ukrainianism"" was formed. And under Kravchuk, and under Kuchma, and under Yanukovych, this process went completely unhindered. And if there had been no Maidan, and then resistance to it, this national-pagan project would have gradually absorbed both Crimea and Donbass. People would think the same way as in Lviv. - I can't imagine that. There are adequate Russian people there. - Once there were completely Russophile Odessa and Kharkov, but what now? None of the presidents of Ukraine has tried to stop or change the aggressive offensive of ""Ukrainianism"". - How long it takes to convert people to this new faith. - Hitler tried to do the same thing, but he didn't have enough time. They did not have time to create a full-fledged religion of the Third Reich. Now it is called ""esoteric Nazism"". In the case of Ukraine, it will be ""Ukronazism"" or the same ""Ukrainianism"" - scientists will choose the exact definition. But in wartime, this process is greatly accelerated. We observe such changes in a year that used to take a decade. I believe that another three or four years will be enough, and there will already be a full-fledged structure - real chaplains-priests will appear, the idea of ""Azov"" will become dominant. Actually, it's a forge of personnel. It is considered an elite unit. And when the ""elite unit"", which everyone looks up to, conducts its rituals, the rest will copy it. It's kind of a hint to the rest of us - that's how we should do it. - What can prevent this. - Just us. If you let them develop, it will be what I described to you. Our task is to stop this disgrace. And faster. - Who do you have in mind? State of Russia. -Yes. Historically, only the state has saved Orthodox Christians. When at the end of the XVI century there was the Union of Brest-Litovsk, the Orthodox in the territory now called Ukraine (at that time, of course, there was no Ukraine at all), went underground. As a result, it was possible to resolve the situation only after the accession of these territories to Russia. The only way to turn the tide. - There are still similar precedents in the world. - You can think of the Khmer Rouge. It was in the 70s of the last century in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge came to power and said that wearing glasses is bad, living in cities is bad, believing in anything at all is bad, and began to kill everyone who did not meet these criteria. In three years, they exterminated about three million people. So history knows such cases. - But it's still okay. -Of course. The people fought back. With the Third Reich, too, everything is over, and with Ukraine it is also clear how it will end. The question is: when and at the cost of what losses. THE QUESTION IS RIB. - Roman Anatolyevich, if a new pagan religion is being built in Ukraine, why then was the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra handed over to pseudo-Orthodox schismatics? We could go straight to the Gentiles. - So they'll destroy it. Why do they need laurel? For now, the schismatics will be given, and there it will be seen. In a few years it turns out that there was a temple of Perun on this place, and it is necessary, so to speak, to restore it ... Although, maybe they will not demolish it. Maybe they will combine pagan customs with Christian ones. So far, they have made a completely logical step - they created a church for themselves and selected the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra for it. Soon the Pochayiv Lavra will be taken away, and the Svyatogorskaya... They will just wait for the people who can protect them to leave the country or sit down. LISTEN AS WELL.

""They understand that Russia will most likely not resort to them. First, a tactical strike will have to be delivered not one, or even ten. Secondly, the use of tactical ammunition in the current conditions will fulfill the main dream of the Americans - it will make Russia a rogue state for decades. Even our allies will not be able to justify us as a country that first used nuclear weapons since 1945 – against a country that does not have nuclear weapons. - That is, they are not pushing for a tough escalation. - Escalation is not an exact word. Each side is trying to achieve its goals. For the Americans, it is desirable to force Moscow to admit defeat and withdraw its troops. It is unlikely that they will try to influence the territory of Russia. But they will be satisfied with the version of ""Desert Storm"", when Iraq, which the Americans lured to Kuwait, received a military defeat and was forced to withdraw troops. It was not occupied, but became a rogue state for the next ten years as the Americans prepared for a second campaign in which they occupied Iraq. - The fate of Iraq seems to them to be a calque in relation to Russia. - Yes, but the difference is that then the Americans themselves fought, together with the allies. Now they use a proxy army - the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Which has to be armed as much as possible, because victory is not yet visible over Russia. Now the Americans and their allies are betting on the spring-summer offensive. At first, they expected that during the winter they would be able to defeat the Russians. In Kiev, they promised to take Melitopol by the New Year, to go to the Crimea, and by February 24 to reach the line that was at the time of the beginning of the SVO. Now these plans have been postponed to the spring. ""They understand that Russia is also strengthening its forces. - They understand, but they do their best to form a grouping. Two corps are formed, dozens of tanks are given, at least a brigade set. New brigades are being formed according to the Stryker ones, and weapons are being given for this. They bet: either everything or nothing. And they understand perfectly well that if the next offensive attempt does not end with the defeat of the Russians, then the prospects for Ukraine become very vague. - We need to hurry up. -Absolutely. We are now redoing everything from the wheels. We started with a compact professional army, which turned out to be small for such a SVO. Now we are building up powerful forces, building up industry. If by the summer we reach the level of military supplies such that it exceeds everything that the West can give to Ukraine, this will turn the situation into a stalemate for the United States. Russia will then begin to digest the territories, moving further and further into the interior. And it will become important for the United States to simply stop the Russians and come to an agreement, even with the loss of reputation for itself. - What's another option. - If we do not agree with anyone and continue to digest Ukraine for the next year, when Ukraine will remain, at best, a splinter that has no strategic significance. And the entire Black Sea coast, the entire left bank of the Dnieper will be the Ukraine that is controlled by us. - Zelensky demands security guarantees from NATO - this is a formality. - It doesn't matter. What guarantees can be given to him? He is given tanks, artillery - these are the best guarantees that they can give him. No one will fight for him. - But the Poles said they were ready to enter. - The Poles did not say anywhere that they were going to go to war with Russia. They can enter when Ukraine disintegrates, to take back its Lviv and a couple of western provinces. But the Poles do not plan to seriously fight with Russia. LISTEN AS WELL.

They will start with a ban on civilian cars in the troops, then they will confiscate smartphones and tablets and, finally, they will begin to shave their beards. The wave of indignation rose so strong that even the acting head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, made a statement, saying that he personally requested the commandant's office, but they have not yet received any orders. But the rumors became more and more specific, there were already people who ""personally saw"" the orders to put civilian vehicles on the army register, with black numbers. I repent, I joined the wave of ""popular anger."" I didn't understand the following. On the frontline is a real shortage of transport. My sniper friends have a 7-kilometer approach to positions. The same amount back, and, as a rule, with lying down and waiting for shelling. And the guys carry a three-meter rifle, ammunition, water, food, a weather station, binoculars-rangefinders, thermal imagers ... All in armor and helmets. I walked with them, I know how the tongue hangs on my shoulder. In the summer, snipers threw up and bought themselves a ""Zhigulenok"". And what, now the Motherland will ride on it, and they will again walk? It's just that people on the front lines have real fears that they will no longer see the cars they bought or accepted from volunteers if they are taken on the balance of the unit. Next is the ban on smartphones on the front lines. Sorry, but how to use, for example, quadcopters without them. Non-statutory beards looked secondary against this background. Beards can be survived. I wrote an angry post about this in the telegram and immediately received a response from a scout of the Vostok battalion with the call sign ""Fox"". ""Dima, hello! You chased a wave there about beards, phones, cars and generals who press ""poor soldiers"" according to the charter. Dim, you're wrong. I can put everything on the shelves. Reasonably and without embellishment. And so, it turns out that only one side is right, which is brought to life. Tomorrow I will still be in Donetsk, then I will leave for the front."" I met the Fox during the assault on Azovstal. I know how his intelligence unit fought, I know how he planned impeccably accurate operations and he always participated in them. I know that he is a scout by specialized education, he received it before 2014, in Kiev, he saw Iraq and Afghanistan, but from the first days of the ""Russian Spring"" he was on our side. His opinion is expensive. We settled in one of the Donetsk cafes for a liter of coffee and milk. I suggested. - Let's start with cars. In my ""post of righteous anger,"" I gave the example of snipers. The Fox agreed. - Come on, I'll start with a specific example. PVD - Temporary deployment point in a front-line settlement. There is a company, conditionally 100 people. Every soldier wants to go to the store, to a familiar young lady and everyone, I emphasize, does not want to leave the ""comfort zone"". How much do ""Zhiguli"" cost now? And the salary. - About 100 thousand for an old, but still living car, and the salary is under 150 thousand or more. - Well, we bought thirty Zhiguli. And where to put the standard equipment now and how to mask it, if in front of the LDPE is now ""parking at the supermarket""? The second point is discipline. LDPE is not a base where there is a barrier and control. Therefore, the soldier at any time gets on his car and goes where he sees fit. In the village, the sale of alcohol is prohibited, but the soldier is no longer afraid of this. The Fox sighs heavily. I sigh too. - And how do the columns go now because of these cars? ""Fox"" asks himself. - Sometimes the column stands, because the torn ""zhigul"" broke, and the soldier cannot throw it, because he bought it for his own. Do you understand what a standing column means and how it can end? And one more important point. Guys, you represent the Russian army, do not behave like a herd of Makhnovists! The ban on personal vehicles in the combat zone is also insurance against looting. The last word ""Fox"" is pronounced with pressure and in syllables. - Okay, but what about pickups and jeeps that volunteers buy for units. - They are issued for a specific person, so that in case of loss it can be removed from the numbers. And the man leaves it under his ass – ""Mine! They sent me!"" As a result, these pickups do not serve, but ride. There are no vehicles in your sniper unit, and there are clouds. There is only one way out - putting on black army numbers, legalization. Whether a fighter is adorned with a beard. ""Mine is decorating,"" fox tells me. He always has a neatly trimmed ""Espanolol"" beard. Always, what is near Ugledar, what is near Mariupol. The Fox develops his thought. - I'm on my officer's ID with a beard, what are the questions? I think it's about appearance in general. There are characters – he lived on the heating main, mobilized. Beard to the waist, braided pigtails and rings like a Viking. You just wash, there will be no questions for you! I'm going to get into the trench tomorrow. According to the forecast, the temperature is plus. Can you imagine what I'll be like in an hour? But I'll change my clothes after the trench! The Fox talks about two extremes on the front lines. - The first is the ""homeless"" style, the second is ""creative"". Okay, no one will tell you anything in the trench. But, if you're walking around town with a ""Bob Marley Squad"" sewing... the Fox sarcastically remarks. - I saw in Volnovakha how the Military Police reacts to such people. The first time, he just makes a remark. If I don't understand, I'm sorry. - The fighter was in a non-statutory uniform. - No, there isn't. We have half of the army in the statutory ""pixel"", half in the statutory ""cartoon"". Someone wears a moss camouflage, that's how I am. The bosses get into the position because one good knead and you're without pants. I carried three pairs of good shoes for Mariupol and finished in factory boots. We ended the conversation with the main thing – the allegedly impending ban on smartphones and tablets on the front lines. In my practice, there was a story when the Armed Forces of Ukraine tracked seven Moscow numbers at once. And covered. As a result, 400 meters we ""departed"" for almost an hour, crawled and lay. Sometimes we ran over. The militias accompanying us genuinely did not understand what was happening, and we were to blame ourselves. And there was another long-standing and unpleasant case. In 2018, I was on the defensive post near Kominternovo, where the previous composition of fighters was cut out by the Ukrainian DRG (sabotage and reconnaissance group) – I listened to hour-long music in headphones. So we listened. - I report, - the Fox began officially. - There is a legend that when you press the button with the airplane in your phone (you cut into the airplane mode), you hide in the house. September at Ugledar, I move from our positions towards the enemy, but the headquarters calls me and says: ""Command Stop!"". They say, ""Where you're going now, thirty phones are beating."" Accordingly, our phones are also visible, that's what you want to turn off. A modern phone is primarily a tracking tool. The only option is a phone from which the battery is taken out. - Okay, but what about controlling quadcopters? With maps. - No one bans gadgets completely, but they must be in the hands of certain people, used for combat, not for entertainment. Here I am, an officer, coming on rotation to the trenches and I see that there is a soldier watching a series. - In headphones. - Of course, the fight is going on, its sounds get in the way. Of course, I'll pick up that phone. But, I have a phone in my positions, there are loaded maps and programs that I need. There is a phone from a fighter who has a small copter for reconnaissance. All. A fighter playing games, if he does not understand Russian from the tenth time, this phone will be nailed to a tree. Like shaving on the front lines. Answer. No one on the front lines shaves. Not before and there are no conditions - clean water, as a rule, is brought on themselves. That's why they take care. They shave after rotation (in a day or three) and return to the Temporary Deployment Point. As a rule, this is a village hut, some kind of building, an equipped dugout town, where there is electricity and water. And there is something to shave - with a blade or a machine - who likes it.

It turns out that the Ministry of Defense of Russia definitely has nothing to do with the crash of a helicopter near Kiev, in which the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Denis Monastyrsky, his deputy and state secretary of the ministry burned down. In total, 9 people were killed in the helicopter crash. Earlier, several versions were put forward in the Ukrainian media: from the Russian sabotage group to the murder of the top of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by SBU agents. But, most likely, the cause of the fall is a banal malfunction of a foreign helicopter or negligence. BATTLE SUMMARY. In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, they have been destroyed. 374 - aircraft. 200 - helicopters. 2903 - unmanned aerial vehicles. 401 - anti-aircraft missile system. 7569 - tanks and other armored fighting vehicles. 985 - combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems. 3865 - field artillery and mortars. 8113 - units of special military vehicles.

Don't go anywhere. The Financial Times reports that the securities of the factories of the defense complex of Germany after the beginning of the crisis in the independent seriously increased in price due to the growth in demand. In particular, according to this publication, after the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the shares of the largest concern Rheinmetall jumped almost two and a half times, and the shares of Hensoldt almost doubled. By the way, it is Rheinmetall who is building a new ammunition plant in Germany, and is also waiting for the government's decision to ""bring to mind"" more than a hundred Leopard tanks. As a result of the crash of the Super Puma helicopter in the city of Brovary near Kiev, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine died - Minister Denis Monastyrsky, his deputy Yevhen Yenin, as well as State Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Yuri Lubkovich. According to the head of the national police, Ihor Klymenko, by the end of the day the death toll reached 18 people, among them three children. The helicopter crashed near a residential building and a kindergarten in Brovary. As a result, there was an explosion and a fire began. Children and teachers from the kindergarten were evacuated. According to Klymenko, the helicopter belonged to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and was heading towards the front. Among the versions of the disaster are considered a malfunction of equipment, sabotage and the human factor. Readers of the Polish portal wPolityce were outraged by the requests of its Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to the German authorities regarding military supplies to Kiev. Morawiecki once again called on Scholz to hand over the tanks to Kiev, saying that ""the defeat of Ukraine can be a prelude to the third world war."" Commentators on the website reminded the head of the Polish Cabinet that he is the Prime Minister of Poland, not Ukraine, and should worry about Polish, not Ukrainian, problems. And it's time to stop dragging the country into a ""dangerous game."" In the sense that you can finish the game. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon supplies Ukraine with a large stockpile of ammunition of NATO caliber with... Israeli warehouses. This is how the U.S. decided to use NATO's large but little-known stockpile of ammunition in Israel, which is housed in bunkers built in the 1970s after the Arab-Israeli conflict. In those years, the Pentagon ""airlifted weapons to replenish the resupply of Israeli forces."" At the same time, it is significant that at the same time Switzerland refused to supply helmets and body armor for Ukrainian troops. And she did not accept the Ukrainian military for treatment. That's what's called true neutrality. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, said that in order for the negotiations between Moscow and Kiev to take place, it is necessary to come to an agreement on two legal aspects. Here is what Dmitry Anatolyevich wrote: ""First, it is necessary to recognize (or, at least, tacitly accept) the results of self-determination of the people of the former territories of Ukraine, which are embodied today in the internal law of Russia – in its Constitution. And secondly, it is necessary to develop special international norms designed for the current situation and future international relations. "" Simply and tastefully, but the other side doubts something strongly. Avril Haynes, director of national intelligence of the United States, during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, expressed the opinion of the American intelligence community that in January 2023, the armies of both participating countries face great challenges in the zone of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Haynes put it this way: ""From the U.S. perspective, the armed forces of both Ukraine and Russia are certainly facing challenges. It will be extremely important for Kiev in the near future to receive military and economic assistance, which should not be reduced."" She reported that the United States is now witnessing ""very heavy fighting"" and believes that the conflict is protracted. Well, for such surprising conclusions, you don't have to be the head of the largest intelligence agency. David Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in Davos, said that agricultural production in the territory of the independent country in the coming 2023 may be halved. According to Beasley, over the past few years, due to climate change, droughts and the pandemic, the number of undernourished and suffering from hunger has increased. A senior UN official said: ""You think it can't get any worse , and here ethiopia, Afghanistan and yesterday's world breadbasket Ukraine, which itself turned into a queue for bread. Production there was not so bad in the past year, but they will not have fertilizers in 2023, and their grain production will be reduced by 45-50%."" Well, you can turn to your western neighbors for manure. The sixth president of the independent state said in an interview with CNN that hostilities with the Russian Federation slowed down in December and January. According to this great strategist, the conflict from the very beginning ""did not look very good,"" and the winter slowed it down altogether. Zelensky, with an expression of heroic fatigue on his cheek, said: ""Everyone is tired – nature, people and, thank God, the enemy too."" Thousands of people whom the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost under the lost Soledar will no longer be heard about the ""fatigue of nature and the enemy"". And thousands of wounded will not understand.

Why won't he get them?,Who and what guarantees can provide him in the midst of a conflict is a mystery beyond the control of reason,"Polish President Andrzej Duda spoke during the World Economic Forum in Davos about the essence of the latest conversations with Zelensky. Either they communicated without interpreters, or Duda did not understand something, or Zelensky began to express himself in the manner characteristic of the mayor of the Ukrainian capital Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko, but the essence of the conversation resembles an attempt to find common ground between an alcoholic and a drug addict. ""We talked about the future NATO summit in Vilnius and told Volodymyr Zelensky that we can assure him that NATO's doors are still open to Ukraine, that we support future NATO membership,"" Duda told reporters. - Vladimir said: ""Guys thank you, I'm grateful, but honestly, I don't want to hear the same story again, I need guarantees. I can understand that now you cannot agree to full membership in NATO, because we are in a conflict, based on Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, this is impossible, but I need guarantees for my country, I need security guarantees. Please talk to the members of the alliance because we need it immediately."" What was that? Zelensky with a stream of the unconscious, or Duda, who distorted the words of the President of Ukraine? What guarantees can anyone provide to the country, and even security guarantees, while the conflict is in full swing. After all, it seems that this is not about the implementation of some promises in the future. Zelensky needs guarantees here and now. Perhaps, after all, Zelensky spoke not about promises, but about strict guarantees of Ukraine's accession to NATO within some insignificant period after the end of the conflict. Most likely, it was. But in this case, Zelensky acts as a complete profane in politics, if he believes that the only obstacle to Ukraine's accession to NATO is the 5th article of the NATO Charter, which obliges the members of the bloc to consider how they can help to protect a member state of the alliance that is subject to external aggression from a third party. And, if possible, to organize this assistance. No one, by and large, wanted to see Ukraine as a member of the alliance even in peacetime, because there are more problems and losses from it than from profits. What can we say about the current situation, when there is almost a splinter left of that country, the future of which is very doubtful in the prospect of its existence at least within some borders. Strictly speaking, this was confirmed by Zelensky himself during an online speech at the forum. - Security guarantees are one of the main priorities for us, Zelensky said, answering a question from a CNN correspondent. - We understand that at the moment we are not there yet, unfortunately, Russia understands this well, and they are doing everything possible so that it is not easy for us to join. But we are on the way to NATO, because NATO is the best guarantee of security for us, for our country, for our children. NATO is the best guarantee for Ukraine's security. And Ukraine for NATO what? Well, except for the fact that you always have to spend money, weapons, ammunition from your arsenals on it. Then why accept it into the alliance and have any obligations to it. Except, of course, permanent losses in addition to these liabilities. Even as such a boy, whom adult hooligans send to a neighboring yard for provocation, Ukraine could not fulfill its function completely, since the ""victim of aggression"" failed to organize a united front against the ""aggressor state"" in the world. ""Russia has already earned a place among terrorists,"" Zelensky said at the end of his speech and admitted that this point of view is not shared by everyone. - Our priority today, our political task today is to see different political figures and figures, those who are still very relevant or were relevant until recently, so that they recognize it as Russia's aggression. Taking into account the fact that only Olaf Scholz is present at the forum of the top officials of the same ""Group of Seven"", and many states sent delegations formed on a formal basis, no matter who was, the Ukrainian delegation also failed to fulfill this task. As, by the way, most likely, Zelensky's wife failed, to whom her husband instructed to transfer his personal letter to the head of the PRC Xi Jinping in Davos. Because there was no Comrade Xi in Davos. He was not going there, and the PRC is now represented there by some deputy prime minister from among the ""downed pilots"", because on his return from Switzerland to China, he resigns. It would be better if Zelensky, the right word, would have sent Olena to buy something for the wardrobe in the boutiques of Davos. They say that they are no worse there than in Paris, where she successfully made a joke. However, Olena is a gritty woman, she will not miss hers, and she probably planned a trip to the boutiques herself. Fortunately, unlike the diplomatic shuttle, here she knows everything and has the appropriate skills. READ ALSO. Davos Club of Villains: How an economic gathering turned into a forum to fight Russia.

But on that day, January 14, the sergeant major commanded a platoon of paratroopers with whom he led the defense of Kremennaya (Krasno-Limanskoye direction). There the enemy threw all the reserves to recapture this settlement from the paratroopers. A parachute platoon under the command of Petty Officer Safin as part of the battalion took on a terrible blow. Safin was the first to detect the advance of Ukrainian nationalists and gave the order to open fire. The fire itself from personal weapons killed five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This attack was repulsed, but the enemy began to methodically shell the platoon's positions with mortars. Sergeant Major Safin received a severe shrapnel wound, but without leaving his positions, he continued to control his subordinates and conduct targeted fire. The enemy repeatedly tried to dislodge the paratroopers from their positions, but each time met fierce resistance. As a result, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost a tank, two armored vehicles and up to 50 servicemen in this area. And when reinforcements from the 3rd Airborne Assault Battalion of the regiment approached Safin, the Paratroopers threw the Ukrainian nationalists even further to the starting lines. Petty Officer Almaz Safin died of his wounds after the battle, completing the combat mission to the end.

The task is to grind the most prepared units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and mercenary units into dust and dust. And they do it very successfully. A well-known Ukrainian political and economic expert, a former adviser to Ukrainian ex-President Leonid Kuchma, Oleg Soskin, proposed to surrender to the SBU the President of Ukraine (so far) Volodymyr Zelensky for treason. According to Soskin, Zelensky illegally removes politicians he does not like, although he himself can be charged for working on Russian television. - Take Zelensky, look at how he performed as a showman in Russia in New Year's programs in 2013 - 2014 and so on, how he glorified Putin and others there. So for this only Zelensky should immediately, so to speak, hand over where it is necessary, Soskin concluded. Voldemar, the case smells like kerosene. As one not the most positive character of this comedy said in such a situation in the film ""The Prisoner of the Caucasus"": Either I take her to the registry office, or she leads me to the prosecutor."" Maybe it's really time to go to Israel, under the wing of mom and dad. Moldovan President Maia Sandu admitted in an interview with Politico that she is ready to give up the country's neutrality in order to join any major military alliance. And, although she did not mention the name of the alliance, but it was a response about the prospects of her country's accession to NATO. And, in fact, there are not many large military blocs on the planet. ""There is now a serious discussion about our ability to defend ourselves, whether we can do it alone or whether we should be part of a larger alliance,"" Sandu said, but stressed that the rejection of neutrality should occur ""through a democratic process."" As politico itself notes, the ""blatant obstacle"" to Moldova's accession to NATO is the presence of the Russian military in Transnistria. Sandu does not consider the country's constitution, which declares Moldova a neutral and non-aligned state, to be an obstacle. Or I just couldn't read it. And on the other hand, why does a Romanian citizen need the Constitution of Moldova. Russian sailors were fined in Norway for coming ashore in camouflage, each set of which had a small Russian tricolor on his chest. According to prosecutor Martina Meslo, who supported the prosecution in court, it was a frightening look of clothing, ""because it looks like a military uniform, and in combination with the image of the Russian flag, it made not only Ukrainian refugees, but norwegian citizens frightened and very nervous. As a result, Russians were fined 5,000 Norwegian kroner, although Norwegian and local legislation do not impose any restrictions on wearing clothes, and, in particular, camouflage. However, as you might expect, ours did not give up so easily and decided to appeal the court's decision on the fine. Moreover, a local lawyer who learned about this story offered his services. If you don't want small tricolors, interrogate that ours will come with a big one. The acting mayor of the city of Kupyansk (Kharkiv region), temporarily remaining under Ukrainian occupation, Andriy Besedin, complained to the correspondents of the British weekly The Economist that pro-Russian sentiments remain significant in the city. The Ukrainian military told the British that they were advised not to accept food from local residents to avoid the risk of poisoning. And the locals themselves, according to them, are very reluctant to accept the help of Ukrainian volunteers, and can completely refuse it, accepting only in extreme cases. Moreover, the mayor believes that some of his countrymen are sending information about the deployment of the Ukrainian military to Russian troops, who are less than 10 kilometers from Kupyansk. The Ukrainians, according to The Economist, could not block the signal of the nearby Russian radio tower, ""which is pumping Russian propaganda into local homes."" ""The vast majority of people here were pro-Russian before the beginning of the armed conflict and now little has changed,"" Besedin summed up the conversation. Okay, even though he didn't admit that he was. In Ukraine, the next preliminary results of the intermediate finish of de-Russification were summed up. In 2022, another record was set during the de-Russification campaign: 2,213 toponyms were renamed in 33 cities. The results of the de-Russification ukrsoryniya were summed up by the Transparency International Ukraine branch. Most of the names were changed by Kiev, which, under the leadership of Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko, got rid of the historical names of 237 streets, alleys, districts, boulevards, parks, squares, squares, lakes and even ships. First place. Following him, the top five also included Vinnitsa (232 renamings), Kryvyi Rih (183), Kamianske (182) and Sumy (179). Kremenchuk (142) and Cherkasy (105) also scored. But in Pavlograd, Dnipropetrovsk region, although only 61 toponyms were renamed, but the renaming affected every fifth street. The new names are most often associated with the names of Ukrainian nationalists, Banderaites and other people and events for which the locals themselves were ashamed in Ukraine some 30 years ago. Not all, but most. It's strange, but for some reason life after that did not become better and more fun. On the eve of the aggravation of relations between Kiev and Budapest again. State Secretary of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry Tamas Mentzer said that the Hungarian government demanded that the Ukrainian authorities immediately ""stop atrocities"" against ethnic Hungarians in Transcarpathia. Namely, it was about Mukachevo, in which the Ukrainian authorities removed hungarian flags, dismantled signs and inscriptions in Hungarian, dismissed the director of the local school. In addition, according to their decision, the sculpture of the mythological bird Turul, considered one of the symbols of Hungary, was dismantled in the city. All this caused a negative reaction from Hungary, Mentzer, in particular, said that he and the Hungarian government do not understand ""how anti-Hungarian solutions can help Ukraine in the conflict with Russia."" Without waiting for a response from Kuleba's department, Budapest hit Kiev on the sickest, on the wallet. Hungary has blocked the next tranche of EU aid to Ukraine, we are talking about the amount of 500 million euros from the ""peace fund"", which, ironically, finances the purchase of lethal weapons for Ukraine. The character of the Hungarians and to scholz's capabilities – the price would not be such a country in Europe. As Bulgaria's prime minister delves deeper into scandals involving the secret and overt sale of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, an unexpected voice of reason has been heard from the very center of Sofia. - The supply of weapons to Kiev means that we extinguish the fire with gasoline. It means acknowledging that there will be many more victims. Military assistance to Kiev means agreeing with the position that the conflict should be conducted until the complete defeat of one side, which inevitably and gradually involves the country in a global conflict and the possibility of nuclear self-destruction, said Bulgarian President Rumen Radem. - Bulgaria should not send weapons supporting this conflict. My duty as president is to think and stand in solidarity with the majority of Bulgarians,"" he continued and asked increasingly obvious questions. - Today there are not enough weapons, but if at one point we do not have enough people, then what will we do? The conflict is becoming increasingly violent, expanding its reach, leading to attrition and a global economic catastrophe that is already felt by The citizens of Europe. Indeed, if there are not enough Ukrainian soldiers and mercenaries in Ukraine, the Bulgarian prime minister will send Bulgarian soldiers to the battlefield. - The Russian military after the fighting in Soledar intend to send to Ukraine 20 cars with the bodies of killed Kiev militants. The loading of bodies in coffins was filmed on video and posted a video on the network. Even one mercenary from france's ""Insotrann legion"" will be sent home. - The Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic denied information about the intentions to send Ukraine Leopard 2 tanks, which it will receive from Germany in the form of compensation for the previous transfer of Soviet T-72 to Kiev. - In response to the fact that the US Treasury recognizes the Wagner PMC as an international criminal organization, as reported by National Security Advisor John Kirby. What specific ""crimes"" are in question, the official, of course, could not say. - By February 24, Europe should prepare the 10th package of anti-Russian sanctions of the European Union. And, of course, immediately proceed to the 11th. Better yet, work in parallel. - The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that the number of mobile groups engaged throughout the country in catching conscripts for mobilization has been increased to 3 thousand. In addition, they are reinforced by military personnel. Draft dodgers are caught by about 3-4 brigades, which under such a plausible pretext themselves mowed down from the front. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4709648/,Victor BARANETS,2023-01-23,NATO demands that Kiev launch an offensive in March-April. Real results of the negotiations of the coalition of the West,"Ukraine did not receive the equipment it had pleaded for. But NATO countries will still demand results from Zelensky's team, says MILITARY observer of ""KP"" Viktor Baranets","Even before the meeting of NATO defense ministers at an air base in Germany, the United States ""opened maps"" - showed the allies what mountains of weapons and ammunition they decided to provide to Ukraine (""KP"" on the eve told about this). Well, this is about the same as it happens at the meetings of thieves in law - the rich leader of the gang will throw a thick pile of money on a tray for the injured ""colleague"", and then vigilantly watch who will give more. No one gave more Americans. And no one expected this - Washington, with its military budget of $ 858 billion (and this is more than all NATO countries combined), may not afford it. He is a perennial world champion in this regard. Opening the meeting at the US military base in Germany - in Ramshatin, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin boasted ""a mass of US military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is unprecedented."" And then he explained why it was being done. ""The new aid package will strengthen Ukraine's air defense system, protect their skies and civilians. We will also strengthen their defenses on the battlefield. Also, as part of the package of assistance to Ukraine, combat vehicles will be transferred - 59 Bradley, 19 Strykers and other armored vehicles. We are also talking about artillery shells and other ammunition. The United States is determined to set an example for how to help Ukraine. The U.S. has also given the Ukrainian military the skills it needs to be more effective on the battlefield. Our European partners have joined us. The United States will continue to increase financial assistance, prioritizing cooperation with the Armed Forces of Ukraine."" Pay attention to the keywords in this tirade - ""show example"". It's ""do as I do"" in another way. Curiously, if the Americans both before and after the meeting in Ramstein trumpeted their arms supplies to Kiev, then its other participants (and there were about 50 of them in total, including pocket NATO allies) were modestly silent. Perhaps there was such an agreement - so as not to frighten the taxpayers of their countries with the scale of the weapons dump. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky published a video in his Telegram channel in which he commented on the results of the meeting in Ramstein and clearly tried to smooth out what was expected, but did not receive in Kiev - by announcing the total scale of arms supplies to Ukraine. That was the hope for an impressive propaganda chip - they say, look, the world in solidarity overwhelms us with weapons. But Ramstein's organizers didn't want to do that. And there was a special reason for that. Closed doors to the meeting leaked the screams and complaints of some NATO defence ministers that the transfer of military equipment was seriously depleting the arsenals of national armies and undermining their readiness. Zelensky clearly hid his disappointment from the fact that the final figures of arms supplies to Kiev were not announced and slyly ""smeared"" the NATO leadership: ""It is not always possible to publicly announce what is being discussed in the Ramstein format. It's a closed discussion and it should be."" But the same Zelensky urged the participants of the meeting: ""Not to argue about the number of tanks, but to open supplies in principle."" Only the British discovered, Others got off only with general words. In addition, the meeting was accompanied by constant rumors and even squabbles: sometimes in the morning it was claimed that ""Germany is no longer against the fact that German tanks were handed over to Kiev by Poland"", then by the evening it was stated that this was nonsense. Sometimes there was a rumor that Poland would give Kiev the Leopards party even without the consent of Germany (reference to the words of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki), then ""Warsaw did not say this."" The ministers were clearly twitching, confusing the curious. the journalistic fraternity. Meanwhile, a sharp drama played out at the air base - some of its participants, forgetting about decency, gnawed at the snarls - only they did not swear. Poland was the most and angrier of all, accusing Germany of betrayal because it itself does not want to transfer Leopard tanks to Ukraine, and Warsaw does not allow this. This is for you on the question of how the Zitz-leader of the NATO gang-group Jens Stoltenberg at all corners stupidly and hypocritically repeats: ""The unity of the bloc is stronger than ever! We have a close-knit family!"" And the ""friendly family"" often looks like a serpentarium. And here is the first conclusion: the meeting in Ramstein showed that there is no ""lasting unity"" in the ranks of NATO, this is just a false propaganda slogan. Trying to make a good mine with a bad game. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin clapped his teeth over the head of the new German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, and twisted his hands miserably, demanding both the supply of German Leopard tanks to Ukraine and Poland's permission to do the same. But the German resisted. True, at the same time, he constantly hid behind the back of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who came up with a cunning move: first, they say, let the States put their Abrams tanks on Ukraine, and then I. The States do not want to do this and also ""waggle their tail"" - they say, our cars are very heavy and will not pass through Ukrainian bridges, and they will get stuck in the mud on the tower. But in fact, they are afraid that American tanks will burn shamefully in the Ukrainian steppes or get to the exhibition of trophies in Moscow or Donetsk. A funny episode happened at the moment when the journalist cheekily ""bit"" into Pistorius with the question - why did you still refuse to supply ""Leopards"" to Ukraine? The minister, with the simple-mindedness of a tired kindergarten toddler, replied: ""I myself do not know how this happened""... So what's the result? As a result, a plan was adopted for a new pumping of Western weapons into Ukraine. And, with a clear emphasis on the offensive. The scale of what was promised to Kiev in Ramstein, even by the Americans alone, looks impressive. But it is also clear to the hedgehog that all this war iron requires professional handling of it. It will not be possible to quickly train Ukrainian crews in calculations. And NATO requires Kiev to launch an offensive in March-April. It is very likely that imported military equipment in this case will be managed not only by the Ukrainian military. But also American professionals under the guise of ""vacationers and volunteers."" Large volumes of Western weapons (and not all of them are new) will inevitably require mountains of spare parts for Ukraine. And these are also railway trains or caravans of trucks on the roads. And what, - we will humbly watch all this, smoking on the hillock ""Prima"". Moscow has already stated several times that all Western military equipment supplied to Ukraine will be our legitimate military target. It would be good if this warning was followed by real strikes. The task of making the supply of Western military equipment to Kiev meaningless is coming to the forefront of our special operation. Our intelligence is well aware of the ""entry points"" of this equipment on the border of Ukraine with Poland, Romania, Slovakia. And we have enough Kalibrs and Daggers. First of all, it is necessary to beat western guns and tanks with them where they are just crawling into Ukraine. For if they spread out in combat positions, it will be much more difficult to do so and can seriously delay the implementation of the plans of the operation. LISTEN AS WELL.

The military rescues abandoned cats and dogs. Who is taken to the units, and who is attached to relatives and friends. Ulyana Skoybeda collected stories from the front, when almost the entire unit of the fighters saved a dachshund named Sossisych and attached the cat Marfa to the mother of the deceased commander of the reconnaissance company of the volunteer battalion. And Ulyana got the diary of a mobilized doctor who picked up a cat on the front line and told how he served with him. DIARY OF A MOBILIZED DOCTOR. Well, friends, my name is Ignatius and I am from the city ... Detsovska (I think it's understandable why I'm distorting the name and the city). By profession I am a resuscitation doctor. The military department is behind him, which is why he received a summons. October 9 – October 14. I'm there. The wounded are brought here to provide pre-hospital care. A lot of wounded. Blood, pain, and the tools to put it all away. Residents of the cities that have come under fire are also brought to me. Medicines and equipment are few, we give our best, we sleep for 4-5 hours. 15 Oct. It's a tough night. I don't have the strength. There is only one small joy. We got a cat. Damn he knows where he's from here, there's not much left alive around. But this little friend is now like a piece of normal life for me. If they throw it to another place, I will ask to take it with me. I've never had anything alive in the house other than fish. As a child, somehow they did not start, and then I was afraid that I would not cope, because I was always at work. And now I realize I'm an idiot. It's more likely that they care about us than we care about them. They entertain when there are heavy thoughts in the head, warm the soul, lying on the chest and, most importantly, cause love and kindness. Kindness is lacking. When you see all these injuries, a lump of hatred creeps up to your throat. Then you see the same suffering in the prisoners and the hatred is a little different. And then you stroke that fluffy face and all the hatred goes away. October 19 – October 22. The positions are quiet. I can't decide what to call the cat. He's still just a Cat. It seems to be the calmest and happiest creature in this location. I'm being thrown to the frontier medical station in the rear! It is necessary to replace the doctor who suffered a heart attack. You can even sleep there sometimes! The cat is coming with me, who needs him here, I don't want him to escape. Fortunately, it is so tame! I threw it by the sinus and drove off. He basks there in my big military jacket. And no special cells are needed. While driving, I was very overwhelmed with excitement or longing, at one point I caught myself thinking that I wanted to stay in the ravine we were passing by. Only pity for the cat and, of course, thoughts about the daughter held back. You can still live for these two. October 23 - October 24. The cat and I are there. I'm already substituting for a colleague. In the morning I managed to get some rest, I lay down and instantly fell into a half-sleep-half-fog. The firing range, the tanks, the explosions... I woke up and realized that I was no longer in bed, but in a ravine. I hear a burst of gunfire and a deafening volley. I can't feel my legs and I'm scared to look there. I overpower myself, look at my feet and realize that my cat, my only friend, the remnant of my soul, my sympathy, my kindness lies on them. Lies torn. I woke up again to my own scream, groping the cat that was basking next to me under my jacket. The dream was realistic. Two days have almost passed. In the evening, the cat and I will go back. October 26 – October 27. I drink coffee and go for the second day. I slept for a couple of hours. It's that I'm already losing my focus of vision, I asked to be replaced, I'm going to rest. The location is cold, there is nothing to heat yet. The cat sleeps around the clock in my blanket, so the place is always heated for me. He only gets up when I come back and feed him. He eats the same thing as me – semi-dry porridge, bread, broth. What they will bring, in general. He doesn't complain. Good cat. If he and I had lived, I would have brought him home. My daughter would be happy. After the shelling the day before yesterday, he lost two colleagues. 28 Oct. Appendicitis. That's what I wasn't expecting. I thought anything could happen to me, but appendicitis? Now, probably, I will be sent to the hospital. For we do not have the conditions for this operation here. 29 Oct. I've gotten a little smaller. I'm lying down. For the first time in 5-7 years I lie down and do not do a damn thing. I forgot to tell: of course, I could not leave the cat on the battlefield. He begged his roommate to look after him, but he watched the wounded all day. Since I was supposed to be transported to a hospital in an ordinary Russian city, I thought that the best option was to take the cat with me. Driving through the suburbs of Donetsk, I stopped at a pet store and bought him a carrier and a collar. Naturally, we couldn't take a cat to the hospital, sterility and all that. So while I was waiting for the operation, I agreed with the guard that he would keep him in his back room, feed him, give him a drink. For loyalty, I gave more tips. Tomorrow a father and daughter will come to see me. They'll take him in. Of course, I'll be lonely without him. So attached to this snot fluffy. But he'll be better off that way. And my daughter has been begging for a cat for a long time. October 30 – November 3. My father and daughter came to see me at the hospital. I don't know how much I've changed this month, I've learned a lot from their faces. I gave the cat away. There was a lot of joy for both the family and the cat! He's a bit skittish because of where he originally was, but I think he'll get used to a quiet home life quickly. After a noisy front line to get into a warm calm house is like winning the lottery. November 4. On the road. Now without a cat. Eh. Today I am already stepping in for a day. 24 November. I was about to take my shift when the soldiers dragged a wounded dog.

Further actions will depend on the combat capability of Western tanks, the general said. Russian troops destroyed a warehouse of artillery ammunition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Malinovka. Also in the Kherson direction, the AMERICAN-made AN/TPQ-36 counter-battery warfare radar station was eliminated. Russian troops took new advantageous positions in the Zaporozhye direction. The Russian Armed Forces destroyed up to 85 servicemen of the Armed Forces in this direction per day. An air raid alert has been declared in five regions of Ukraine.

According to the Germans, the fall of the city will affect the entire line of defense of Ukraine, and will allow Russia to move even further into the Donbass. The BND reported that the enemy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acted in the area ""with merciless cruelty."" Earlier it became known that Russian units liberated Kleshcheyevka in the suburbs of Artemovsk and the village of Lobkove in the Zaporozhye direction. Well, the secrets of the Germans are the secret of Polichinel. William Burns, the head of the CIA, secretly visited the Ukrainian capital and met with the sixth president of The Independent Republic. Burns came to Kiev to inform the tragicomics in hacks exclusive information about the alleged plans of the Leadership of the Russian Federation for the coming weeks. Burns also told Zelensky that it would soon be more difficult to help Ukraine. After that, the receiving party had to burst into tears and run away to the Dnieper reeds, but, fortunately, the doctor brought a white powder. The Ministry of Defense of Finland reported that Suomi will provide the largest package of military assistance to ukraine. And this will be the 12th package of military equipment for Ukraine from the side of the country of lakes, saunas and Jolupucca. President Sauli Niinistö decided on deliveries on January 19, 2023 at the suggestion of the Cabinet. With this package of military assistance, the sum of all defense supplies of Helsinki for Kiev is 590 million euros. Finnish Defense Minister Mikko Savola noted that heavy artillery and ammunition are being supplied. Though old, but still. Well, now it's going to be more fun. Politico reports that a number of EU countries are ready to join forces to put pressure on Germany on the issue of supplying Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks. The leader of such a coalition, it seems, will be Poland. It consists of countries that have leopard 2 at their disposal. The authorities of some of the 12 such states have already expressed a desire to transfer combat vehicles to Kiev. At the same time, they are dissatisfied with the policy of the German leadership, which associate the possibility of making such a decision with the transfer of Abrams tanks to the United States. Yes, the Germans just remember what happened to the tanks of the ""Center"" group on these lands about 80 years ago. Sergey Kupriyanov, an official representative of Gazprom, said that the company supplies Russian gas for transit through the independent country in the amount confirmed by the Ukrainian side through the Sudzha GIS. And this is 24.4 million cubic meters as of January 20. On Wednesday, pumping was 32.6 million cubic meters, on Thursday it fell to 25.1 million. The company stressed that it fulfills all obligations to consumers of the Old World, and transit services are fully paid. But it would be better if the ""blue fuel"" went along the Nord Stream. In Krakow, they demanded to stop the ""occupation"" of the main square of this ancient city by Ukrainian ""refugees"". The pickets of Ukrainians caused indignation among local nationalists. Every day, a small but loud group of people stage noisy political demonstrations there, using a sound system and violating the ""dignified and at the same time tourist character of this place."" The nationalists demanded that the authorities ""immediately put an end to the situation"", which ""causes pain and shocks"" both residents and visitors to the city. Hurting and shocking is a good baseball bat in strong hands. Arvydas Anushauskas, Lithuania's defense minister, said Vilnius would hand over two Mi-8 helicopters and L-70 short-range anti-aircraft guns to Kiev. The minister said: ""The new Lithuanian aid package to Ukraine includes over ten L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ammunition and two Mi-8 helicopters. The total value of this batch is approximately 125 million euros."" Previously, the Lithuanian army had three Soviet-made Mi-8 helicopters and three European Dauphin helicopters acquired ten years ago. The operational life of these Mi-8s, which went into their fourth decade, has been exhausted, and operation is difficult. But what does it mean for Kiev kamikazes. The Hill reports that the Pentagon demanded that the leadership of American troops stationed in South Korea send equipment and materials to help Ukraine. The U.S. military in South Korea (USFK) has 28,000 troops, and they are ready to give some of their bins to Kiev. USFK spokesman Col. Isaac Taylor said, ""This will have no impact on our operations and our ability to meet our firm commitments to protect our ally."" You're going to send helmets and diapers. James Challis, a mercenary from Canada, admitted that the Ukrainian army in the Kherson direction lost five times more fighters than their opponent. Challis said that he came to Ukraine in the spring as a military instructor, and in the summer he joined the ""international legion"" and went to the Kherson direction. According to him, the brigade in which he served lost more than 500 fighters in a short time. Challis complained about corruption in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He noted that the fighters are forced to buy ammunition for their money. And he said that the fighting in the special operation zone is not similar to other conflicts.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4709090/,Victor BARANETS,2023-01-20,"""Bradley"", ""Strykers"" and ""Humvee"" - iron for an entire army. What will change US military assistance to Ukraine by $ 2.5 billion",Military observer KP.RU Viktor Baranets explains whether this is a lot or a little. What weapons from the new American package are the most dangerous for Kiev and why they are offensive or defensive?,"So, the Pentagon officially announced the allocation of another package of military assistance to Ukraine for $ 2.5 billion. This was officially reported by the press service of the Pentagon. President Joe Biden has already instructed the State Department (or rather, Secretary of State Blinken personally) to drop weapons to Kiev for the above amount. The list of military equipment and ammunition that the United States will send to Ukraine is already known. It will be one of the largest shipments of weapons that Washington has ever issued to Kiev. Another point is curious here - military-political. The White House and the Pentagon did not even wait for the meeting of NATO defense ministers planned in Germany (Ramstein Air Base). Here the United States clearly wants to show an example to the NATO colony allies: they say, we are generous, now you will not be stingy. In short, there will be a ""cap in a circle"". Of course, it is unlikely that anyone will give more to Ukraine than the United States, but they will throw off (although they have already raked a lot out of kiev's weapons arsenals). The timing of the shipment of American weapons is not reported, but it seems that it will appear in Ukraine in the near future. Washington is in a hurry. Especially after the successes of the Russian army began to emerge (the capture of Soledar, the encirclement of Artemovsk) and all the signs of a breakthrough of the first echelon of the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbass (with further access to Slavyansk-Kramatorsk) appeared. The Americans make no secret of the fact that they need the Ukrainians to defeat Russian forces by forcing Moscow to sit down at the negotiating table with a weak position. Well, now let's look at the list of American (so far only American!) weapons and ammunition and try to understand how these supplies can affect the conflict in Ukraine. 59 Bradle IFVs. 90 Stryke armored vehicles. 8 Avenge air defense systems. 53 armored vehicles with enhanced mine protection. 350 Humve armoured multi-purpose vehicles. Ammunition for NASAMS and HIMAR MLRS. 20 thousand shells of 155 m caliber. 95 thousand 105-mm shell. 600 high-precision ammunition for artillery guns of caliber 155 m. 11.8 thousand mortar ammunition of caliber 120 m. 2 thousand anti-tank rake. Claymor anti-personnel mines. 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms. So, as we can see, this list includes, for example, 59 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. This is by American standards about one and a half battalions of ""armor"" (in the US mechanized brigade there are about 150 units). This is a good machine (entered service in 1981), it was actively used by US troops in the wars in the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan. As the Americans did not advertise it on the world market, and only one country bought Bradley - Saudi Arabia. And all because the car has weak armor, which even the most primitive grenade launchers take. And its armament seems to be so-so - only a 25-mm gun. But the Bradley also has another weapon - TOW anti-tank missiles. And this is already serious (that's why the Americans gave the name of their BMP ""Tank Killer""). But this is in battles with weak armies. And for us, of course, ""Bradley"" is unlikely to be right now. For example, if you contrast it with a tank support combat vehicle (BMPT) with the formidable name ""Terminator"". Our fighters on the front line are looking forward to Bradley, they have an incentive - for the destruction of each such car they are promised at least 50 thousand rubles (although there is a rumor that all 100). The U.S. list includes 90 Stryker armored vehicles. A frail ""fist"". And this technique is not ""plywood"", it already has good armor, which allows you to protect the crew and paratroopers from small arms fire of up to 14.5 mm caliber from the sides and stern, as well as from 30-mm shells from the forehead of the hull at distances of over 500 meters. ""Stryker"" exists in two forms - as an armored personnel carrier and as a BMTV (combat vehicle with heavy weapons, 105-mm gun). Other weapons include 12.7 mm and 7.62 mm machine guns, as well as 40 mm grenade launchers. In general, it will not be ""thrown caps"", but will have to be beaten with grenade launchers, tanks, guns, attack drones such as Lancet or Geranium-2, and, of course, our best anti-tank complex Kornet. The United States allocated to Ukraine in a new package and 8 Avenger air defense systems. This is a self-propelled short-range anti-aircraft missile system, placed on the chassis of the HMMWV SUV. Designed to destroy air targets at altitudes from 500 to 5000 meters. The thing is serious. Moreover, if we take into account that the complex includes 2 containers with 4 Stinger missiles, an anti-aircraft machine gun of 12.7 mm caliber, and even its own radar. Moreover, the detection system is all-weather and even with a thermal imager. It is clear that our pilots over the battlefield will need to keep an ear to the ground. In the list we see 53 armored vehicles with enhanced mine protection of the MRAP class. This is (in American speaking) mine-resistant, that is, resistant to the explosion of mines, a wheeled armored car with a large ground clearance and a V-shaped bottom. When hitting a mine, it resists fragments well and allows you to effectively dissipate the energy of the mine explosion (although much depends on its power). Also, as you can see, Washington was generous with 350 Humvee armored cars. It's a kind of ""multi-purpose wagon."" It exists in several versions (with an open and closed body), equipped with machine gun, small arms and grenade launcher and missile weapons of various calibers, as well as control and communication equipment. This machine has 250 ""horses"" under the hood, which allows it to quickly move on the battlefield. But its main weakness is poor protection from machine gun fire. But the fact that the United States provides new batches of ammunition for NASAMS anti-aircraft missile systems (range of destruction from 20 to 180 km) and HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems (range from 30 to 300 km) is a sure sign that the Pentagon intends to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine both cover its positions from the sky and hit our troops and cities in operational depth. It is curious that the Americans promised to transfer to the Ukrainians also high-precision GLSDB ammunition (with a range of about 150 km), they did not get into this package. Apparently, the United States decided to keep them in the ""stashnik"" for the time being. And share them depending on how the Armed Forces of Ukraine will use the already provided ones on the battlefield. Well, the myriad of ammunition for Ukraine (again see the list) and their purpose also speaks volumes: it is the prevention of shell and cartridge ""hunger"" (as well as reducing the intensity of fire), it is the build-up of anti-tank weapons (as Russia's response to the increase in ""armor"" on the battlefield), it is also readiness for both offensive and defensive actions (Claymore anti-personnel mines with a directed explosion radius of 100 meters). Of course, this american package of arms assistance to Ukraine alone (and the entire NATO package will be announced in Ramstein!) makes an impressive impression not only on ordinary people, but also on military specialists. If you take everything in a compartment, then all this is enough to equip, if not the whole front, then certainly a multi-thousand army for sure. Moreover, - for long-term warfare. The United States and other NATO countries are clearly in a hurry to pump the Armed Forces of Ukraine with new batches of weapons and Ukrainian personnel trained at their bases. This rush is all the more noticeable the more it becomes clear that the Russian army is taking the initiative in its own hands and does not intend to slow down in the offensive (looking through binoculars at Slavyansk-Kramatorsk). And here the question arises: how can the situation on the battlefield change if all these mountains of weapons promised by the United States and its allies reach Ukraine? This could be a major headache for our command. For we will have to deal with a significantly increased potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Consequently, we need to correct the plans for the special operation somewhere, increase the number of weapons on the front line, and so on. There is, however, another way to solve this problem. It is obvious - to beat the flow of weapons from the West already at the ""entry points"" to Ukraine. And this requires not only massive missile strikes on the railways, bridges and tunnels of Ukraine, but also powerful air operations. We have the means to do so. If we fail to put a reliable barrier to NATO supplies, they will spread across Ukraine and it will be much more difficult to ""dig out"" them on the battlefield. And, finally, let no one be intimidated by these impressive lists of Western weapons. We will counter them with our own - our defense industry has long switched to a special mode of operation.

Analytics with a name"" on radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" told about the situation in the area of Artemovsk, around which the pincers of the Russian army are shrinking. Today, the Wagner PMC and Yevgeny Prigozhin officially announced: the village of Kleshcheyevka (it is located south of Artemovsk) has been completely taken under control. You can treat such news differently - there are local successes, there are small ones, and there are larger ones. For example, near the small village of Prokhorovka in 1943, the Nazis broke the ridge during the operation on the Kursk bulge. Similarly, Kleshcheyevka may be a small village, but on the scale of the entire operation it can play an important role. We have many such villages ahead. Some will be taken as a result of the formation of boilers, some - by heavy assault actions, as in the case of Kleshcheevka. But today, pardon the pun, there are ticks around Artemovsk. Thanks to this success, today on the northern flank of these pincers we have taken Soledar, the village of ""Sol"" and Rudnik-7, on the southern - Kleshcheyevka, through which you can already slowly move towards the highway connecting Artemovsk and Konstantinovka. From Soledar and from the village ""Sol"" storm troops move towards Paraskovievka (this, by the way, is the very settlement where the famous mines are located, in which wagons with small arms from the Great Patriotic War are stored at a depth of 152 meters). And from Paraskovievka it is already possible to go to the next supply line of Artemovsk, leading to Slavyansk. There are still roads that lead through Chasov Yar to Kramatorsk. And I think that Chasov Yar will become the next inhabited point after Artemovsk, which will be taken by Russian troops. But first, of course, it will be necessary to deal with Artemovsky. It is a well-fortified city. The enemy is still sitting in it and he continues to prepare for street fights. This can be seen in their videos that hit the network. They prepare thoroughly. That is, there will not be an easy walk, but again exhausting city fights, where the more motivated, opponent will prevail. And the ""Wagnerians"" showed that in street fights they have no equal yet. Naturally, it will be necessary to divert forces to stop the threat from the north - so that Ukrainian troops do not enter Soledar. And they can, because Zelensky continues to pull units in this direction. So most likely, pressure from Lysychansk to Seversk can go from the personnel units of the armed forces. As we approach the next fortified areas, it is likely that the enemy will form more and more lines of defense a little further. We observed this during the battles for Rubizhnoye, when they were entrenched in Severodonetsk, and during the battles for Severodonetsk itself, when they were fortified in Lisichansk. And having rolled back from Lisichansk, they fortified themselves in Seversk. And so it will continue. They will resist and rest until they prepare the next line of defense. But everything will depend on how much resources will allow the offensive to continue. The capture of the defense line, which goes from Avdiivka to Slavyansk - Druzhkovka, Konstantinovka, Kramatorsk - most likely, is not the most immediate prospect. The Ukrainians were well fortified in Avdiivka and now, when we are gnawing out the positions, we see that everything there is poured into concrete. They've built concrete bunkers that artillery doesn't take. Therefore, the units of the First Corps are conducting heavy assault work. By the way, not only ""Wagnerians"" know how to storm positions and cities. The first body on this also ate the dog. You can remember how they courageously took the Sands, and now there are battles for Vodyanoye. I do not know what plans the top leadership has, but it is obvious that even in the event of the liberation of the entire Donetsk People's Republic, it will not be possible to completely eliminate the threat of shelling of the same Donetsk - Kiev will undoubtedly have weapons that hit far away. So apparently it won't end there. Subscribe to Alexander Kots' author's podcast ""Analytics with a Name"". LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4709646/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-21,"""We lose, Ukraine may disappear"": the dismissed adviser to Zelensky revealed the whole truth","After his resignation, he began to predict the defeat of Kiev. For how long?","The well-known, now former, freelance propagandist of the Office of the President of Ukraine Oleksiy ""Lyusya"" Arestovich has now also become to some extent the ""postman Pechkin"" Tom, I remember in the cartoon reasoned: ""Why was I angry before? Because I didn't have a bike. And now I'm going to start doing good right away."" Arestovich did not promise to be kind, as well as promises not to lie anymore, but the changes are obvious. Why didn't he lie before? Because the position demanded. And now the position is gone. And Alex started trying to tell the truth. Sometimes even a very bitter truth. Where are the promises to deal with the Moskals and defeat Russia in the next 2-3 weeks, at worst, in 2-3 months? At one time. And in the present, Arestovich's predictions are given out exactly the opposite. - I'm an unofficial person already, I can say what I want. If everyone thinks we're guaranteed to win the war, it's very different. Since the 14th, it has stopped looking very much like it. Do you think the assessment from Duda, the President of Poland, and not only he said about the decisive months, that it is not known at all whether Ukraine will survive, it was just said, or is he saying this on the basis of some information? - ""suddenly"" saw ""Lucien"", who did not miss the chance to emphasize his new status and show off it in front of the public. - We missed not only a military chance during this time - we lost time, the Russians found a way, starting mobilization, to restore the situation at the front and even create a certain superiority in some places. Not only because the West did not give us weapons – we missed the public chance domestic political and state. - And when you miss the chances - you do not play, they begin to play you, you do not keep up with the moves and you begin to have frustration, you begin to sit down psychologically and go to the lower chakras - not without the usual for him ""fog"" esotericism Arestovich, but the conclusion was made very unexpected for everyone who recently watched and listened to him, hanging noodles on his ears. - Therefore, before gyping at bad Russians and rejoicing that we are invincible, I remind you - we are invincible only until we begin to gnaw at each other. When we started bickering with each other, we are very victorious both in the shortest possible time and unexpectedly for ourselves. It seems that out of habit, he wanted to designate the same time frame as before - 2-3 weeks or 2-3 months - but at the last moment he managed to hold on. His epiphany also touched upon what is happening in Ukraine itself. - Don't you think that we are in a story that we are no longer spinning? They knocked out Arestovich, who was the official voice, one of the official voices, and there's a lot of other things going on – as a person who had a little to do with these things in life, I can say that we are already in a story that we are not spinning. A story is already unfolding, which we do not control, - Repeats Arestovich. It is noteworthy that this time he ranted not in the YouTube channel of the fugitive Russian liberal and ex-lawyer Mark Feigin. And in his own. Feygin would obviously have nailed Arestovich for such revelation and treason to Ukraine if they had met now. No, ""Lucien"", it doesn't count that way. And to repent for lying, and to apologize? And tomorrow he will be given a position, and he will again scream at it, everything that he had praised before. And the most interesting thing is that those who believed him yesterday, curse him today, tomorrow they will again listen to him with the greatest attention and believe, believe, believe. Such an untrainable herd is good to be a shepherd. There is not even a need to write anything about them. They speak for themselves and all speak for themselves. LISTEN AS WELL. Large-scale changes are coming to the Russian army (more)"

One and a half platoons of Ukrainian ""warriors of light"" were leveled. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, aviation and artillery of the Central Military District were attached to units of the 95th DShB of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Serebryanka in the DPR and the 24th Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Novovodyanye in the LPR. Enemy losses exceeded two platoons killed and wounded. In the Donetsk direction, units of the Southern Military District beat the enemy in Galitsynovka, Krasnohorivka and Nevelskoye in the DPR. Up to 80 Ukrainian fighters, three French Caesar self-propelled guns and an American M-777 were destroyed. In the South-Donetsk direction, the units of the VVO, having occupied advantageous lines, destroyed more than 30 Ukrainian servicemen, two armored vehicles and three pickups. More scrap metal, good and different. Asia Times believes that the Ukrainian territory in its landscape is suitable for the clash of masses of military armored vehicles, which ""Russia and the West will take advantage of."" Vast open spaces contribute to tank battles, where the British Challenger 2 could collide with a Russian T-90 tank. Earlier it became known that the British authorities, in addition to 14 Challenger2 tanks, will supply independent heavy artillery and more than 200 units of other armored vehicles, in particular, Bulldog armored personnel carriers and additional drones. It is significant that the inhabitants of Britain decided that the transfer of British tanks to Kiev is treason. The islanders, we need to get used to Ukrainian, they would call it zrada. Refugee from Ukraine Elena Znatkova spoke about the difficulties after she was in the British Isles. She said that the language barrier negates experience, skills, knowledge. Znatkova was a lecturer at a university, but cannot put her experience into practice in Britain. Together with her daughter, she settled in Cardiff under the ""Houses for Ukraine"" program, but due to the large influx of Ukrainian refugees, local authorities are asking them to leave Britain. In total, almost 8 million refugees from the independent country arrived in the countries of the Old World, over the January weekend they increased by 52,122 people. The most destitute of the fugitives wash their bitter lot in alpine resorts like Courchevel. Colin Cole, undersecretary of defense for political affairs, said that the US administration believes that the time to supply the Armed Forces of Ukraine with American Abrams tanks has not yet come. Kohl recently returned from a trip to Ukraine, and what he saw and heard clearly did not reassure him. The deputy minister began to speculate that this tank is very expensive and complex, it has a jet engine and it is difficult to train on it. Instead of Abrams, Washington will send Kiev 100 Stryker combat vehicles and at least 50 Bradley armored vehicles, artillery and ammunition. Yes, tanks are not toys for children. The sixth president of Ukraine criticized Western partners for ""indecision in the supply of tanks."" Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky said that in such matters one should not hesitate. And the rhetoric in which NATO countries give weapons, if the rest of the members of the alliance do the same, called incorrect. Well, for example, the Bundestag did not approve of tank deliveries. That's right, we need to wait until the summer - and there the tanks will not save. The Daily Mail reported that the number of recruits in the British army has dropped sharply. Because of the conflict in Ukraine, His Majesty's subjects are massively refusing to wear military uniforms and take up arms. During the year, the number of recruits was just over 5090 people, and 2400 people left the troops. The number of those who resigned increased by 17% compared to 2021. Army Chief Patrick Sanders said: ""The figures show that the British armed forces are rapidly shrinking and the country has become 'weaker' after handing over so much equipment to Ukraine. "" And James Cleverly, the foreign minister, said that the UK will send to Ukraine more than 200 units of armored vehicles in addition to 14 Challenger 2 tanks. The leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, a member of the Dutch Parliament Geert Wilders said that the decision of the Dutch government to supply the Patriot air defense system to Kiev jeopardizes the country's security. Wilders put it this way: ""Our own security is at risk. Our money is our weapon. Absolutely irresponsible."" The Netherlands is armed with only three Patriot batteries, and about a hundred 100 Ukrainian soldiers have already begun training to work on these air defense systems. Usually the preparation takes several months. Well, there's no need to rush... Yuri Gempel, head of the peninsula's parliamentary committee on public diplomacy and interethnic relations, said that if the Kiev regime tries to strike at Crimea with the weapons that will now be supplied from the United States, then Russia's response will be serious. The parliamentarian said the following: ""Any such attempt will receive a crushing response and the Russians will support such a decision. Russia is pursuing a balanced reasonable policy, sometimes too restrained, some may perceive this as a weakness, but this is not so. "" And the current regime in Ukraine will be destroyed, the politician said. Well, where will it go... Ukrainian students in Poland filed a complaint against a teacher of a local school because of her participation in the action against the ""Ukrainization"" of the country. Kresy reported that Małgorzata Żyta, a mathematics teacher in the city of Nisk, participated in the picket under the slogan ""No to the Ukrainization of Poland."" Schoolchildren from the independent country filed a complaint against her, and the director of the training center sent the case to the Disciplinary Commission under the Board of Education. The teacher had to give an explanation to the representative of the commission. And in the city of Tarnobrzeg, a rally was held in defense of The Number, where MP Grzegorz Braun from the Confederation party spoke: ""As it turned out, concern for the security of Polish identity in Subcarpathia can lead to sad consequences for the teacher."" The sad consequences are caused by the growth in the number of bandera fans on Polish territory. LISTEN AS WELL. How soon will the general battle in Ukraine take place (more)"

In the area of the village of Korsunki on the right bank of the great Russian river, an accumulation of BMP and enemy manpower was discovered. They were hit with everything that burns. The result for the Banderites is sad: six decayed infantry fighting vehicles, three boats that sank near the shore, more than a company of ""warriors of light"" that have gone into oblivion. Earlier, the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled Novaya Kakhovka from artillery for two days. We were preparing for the landing. The preparation was unsuccessful. Learn math. On the Crimean peninsula, FSB officers stopped the activities of a cell of the terrorist organization Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami * (banned in the territory of the Russian Federation). Her efforts were coordinated with the territory of the independent. Six members of the terrorist structure were detained. According to the FSB, when coordinating the actions of emissaries of a terrorist organization staying in Ukraine, ""these persons conducted purposeful work to spread terrorist ideology on the territory of our country."" Attempts to recruit Local Muslims into Russia have failed. Chuck Callesto, a former congressional candidate from Florida, said that the United States instead of tanks should set Zelensky a big bill. Callesto said: ""Senator Graham called on the U.S. to send tanks to Zelensky after his trip to Ukraine. But the only thing that needs to be sent to Zelensky is a multibillion-dollar bill."" It is characteristic that on the eve of the Pentagon said that the United States will not supply Kiev with Abrams tanks because of the high cost of maintaining this heavy equipment. Heavy machinery is a tough choice, hard times... Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, confirmed the information about his resignation from this post. He thanked the Ukrainian president ""for his trust and the opportunity to do good deeds.""Tymoshenko expressed gratitude to each head of the regional military administrations and wrote ""see you there."" Earlier, his adviser and chief oracle of the independent Arestovich escaped from Zelensky. Also, in five regions, the heads of administrations were replaced, and in the government - three deputy ministers. Baba with the cart - the mare is lighter. You can't be famous for good deeds. Since the Armed Forces of Ukraine will not be able to service NATO tanks themselves, which Kiev will still be delivered to ukraine from day to day, several hundred Western armored vehicle specialists will arrive on the contact line. We are talking about a battalion of 40 tanks and about 350 personnel. In general, the crew in American, German and British tanks is four people, and the machines themselves are so expensive and complex that With many devices and systems that need to be configured and maintained, Ukrainian soldiers of light may not be able to cope. The armor is strong and your tanks are clean. Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, said that the liberated Krasnopolyivka in the Soledar district was cleared. Next in line is Dvorechye. Pushilin said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have one road left, which allows you to get to Artemovsk relatively safely. He added that Europe's largest salt mining enterprise Artemsol in Soledar will be restored as soon as possible, but it is inexpedient to restore residential buildings destroyed by Ukrainian security forces here, it is easier to build new ones. And on the wounds of the retreating salt will be poured as before. Tatyana Berezhna, deputy head of the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, said that the ""army of restoration"" already has about 5 thousand people. Ukrainian unemployed people are invited to join this army. For their work, the participants of the formation receive about 6700 hryvnia (about 12 500 rubles). That's slightly more than the average unemployment benefit. Last year, the state financed the implementation of such works for 29 million hryvnias. In 2023, 104 million hryvnias are provided for this. Money is not your own - it is not a pity to spend, and digging trenches will not save anyone from anything. There is evidence that Zelensky appealed to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States with a request to eliminate the founder of the Wagner PMC Yevgeny Prigozhin. According to the chairman of the movement ""We are together with Russia"" Vladimir Rogov, the attempt on the head of the PMC was discussed during the visit of CIA Director William Burns to Kiev last week.

""The head of the anti-aircraft missile crew, Lieutenant Leonid Kagramyan, with his crew, carried out tasks to protect the grouping of Russian units from strikes by air attack weapons of Ukrainian nationalists. The enemy, seeking to deprive the Russian group of cover from air strikes and destroy military infrastructure, attacked the positions of Russian troops with the use of multiple launch rocket systems and unmanned strike aircraft. While on combat duty, Kagramyan timely gave the command to his subordinates for radar detection and escort of enemy weapons. During the battle, Leonid competently led his subordinates, distributed targets according to their importance and timely issued target designations for their destruction. Thanks to the professional actions of Leonid Kagramyan and his subordinates, air targets in the area of action of the crew were destroyed, including two Khymars MLRS shells, as well as one attack unmanned aerial vehicle of the nationalists.

But, my car does not drive, but slides on spikes through the mud, sometimes by barrel. The white camouflage net was left bored in the trunk - winter still has not come here. I asked the fighters, like, are you waiting for snow? The answer was surprising. - No, let it be the same. Snow has its drawbacks - all traces and paths, the approach to positions, ruts from equipment immediately begin to ""read"". And so, everything is stirred in blackness and okay, we are accustomed to dirt ... They look enviously at my boots with earbuds, it says ""Up to -20"" on my side. I tell them an anecdotal story from Donetsk life. Of course, going to donbass, I forgot something at home – those rubber boots. My wife, a kind heart, wrote to me happily: ""I ordered you boots through 'Oh..."" (well, the largest online store in Russia. – Author), in three days they will come!"". Indeed, they arrived. I look at the screenshot of the map, trying to understand where the point of issue is and understand that there are no such streets in Donetsk. This is the eponymous town of Donetsk in the Rostov region. The story is met with sympathetic comments – everyone here just once came across with the delivery. There was only a sediment from the incomprehensible inertia of our traders. Are the days of frostbitten Russian merchants long gone? True, some kind people brought these boots to Donetsk by trucks, but twice as expensive. Crumpled, like everything here, yes bought, nowhere to go. Rheumatism is more expensive to treat. The battalion headquarters, as expected, is deep underground. The antennas are placed god knows where, far away, in general, so as not to be directionalized. The entrance is blocked by heavy and thick blankets - for warmth and at the same time, from enemy thermal imagers. I drink coffee with a staff officer. It tells an almost legendary story. The old battalion drone, with mighty wings, which had already survived hundreds of sorties, the Ukrainians tried to land with the help of electronic warfare (electronic warfare). But, ours are also not fools, so the enemy did not succeed. They didn't put me in jail. But they knocked it out. - It was hardly a Buk, most likely, it was shot at from the Wasp, the missiles were not spared. We talk to the officer about the children, about how hard it is for them to recognize fathers who sometimes return home... My old friend with the call sign ""Forest"" pours into our basement, it's up to me. I got acquainted with the ""Forest"" during the assault on the ""Azovstal"", came with its assault group, was at the clearing of the cellars. It was then that I experienced an unforgettable experience - I saw how a brick wall bends in a wave from close arrivals. The ""forest"" had not yet warmed up from a 20-day sitting in full encirclement in a frozen 9-storey building on the outskirts of Mariupol. Then I met him in the hot summer, in a pit by the highway, under machine gun fire. Here, in the Ugledar direction. In the autumn, we listened to Putin's speech on the radio, on the day when Donbass returned to Russia. In general, we are well acquainted. The Forest is still smiling, but it's the commander's smile. You can order, growling and stomping your feet, you can smile, the result, at least, will be the same. The Forest instructs, with a smile, of course. - The road is calm, but it will be 200 meters away, they tried to get me there several times from the ""Boot"" (Mounted anti-tank grenade launcher. - Author), but did not get hit. In general, the ""boot"" is a very good weapon, I would compare it with the legendary forty-five gun. That's just not everyone knows how to handle it or wants to work with it. -Why. - Dill don't like ""boots"" either. I don't like them very much, so they call artillery to the position with the ""boot"" working. - They have aviation here. - Extremely rare. 60-millimeter mines are thrown at us from copters, we call them ""Poles"". They used to be Polish-made, now they are homemade. The Forest finishes the briefing. - As soon as the car stops, we jump out, not lingering for a second and run after me without lagging behind. We almost get to the point, a fighter emerges from the twilight. - Guys, further down the road the dill tank works. ""The Forest"" throws. - Yes we have already arrived. He looks back at me and jumps out of the car. The basement of the guys is gorgeous. Warmth. And, unlike the staff dungeon, even the floor is somehow warm. The stove is trophy, its handles are from packages for Grad shells. We are greeted by the head of the household with the call sign ""Tankman"". On the voices of guests from all corners, cats appear, meet. ""Tankman"" complains. - In the fall, the mice ate. They brought us 16 mousetraps, ten disappeared miraculously. Then I walked through the village and mobilized all the abandoned cats. - Didn't shy away. ""Tankman"" laughs. - Yes they are ""waiting""! They were waiting for us! All the mice here were clearly worked out. I ask ""Tankist"" to tell on camera. He's embarrassed, he's disgusted. Say. - Don't Give Up Fame! The Fox wrote about the scout only twice and sent him 12 kilos of condensed milk from Belarus, a targeted delivery, and the other day he handed it over. The word ""condensed milk"" works magically. The ""tanker"" takes out a battery razor, sits on the couch under the portrait of Karl Marx and shaves. Marx, with his exuberant hazing beard, looks at his back disapprovingly. I sort out the gifts. At the sight of the sausage, the cat tribe comes to life and takes me into a tactical environment, and the most arrogant jumps to his knees, purrs, looks into the eyes, but you can't lead me. On the hands are socks tied and handed over to the fighters by the wife of the special correspondent of ""Komsomolka"" Lyosha Ovchinnikov (he visited the Donbass more than once, since 2014). The guys admiringly talk: ""Homemade!"" They remember who and what socks grandmothers knitted. Somehow, imperceptibly, we move on to a slippery topic – ""attitude to Donbass on the Big Earth"". A young boy, dressed from head to toe in a statutory, not yet worn out, tells how his evacuated family tried to rent a house in Taganrog in the summer. - Some of them said so to me - because of you it all began, there are no apartments for you here! Although, there were a lot of empty apartments. I include ""politruk"". - In 2020, a taxi driver picked me up from the border, asking: ""What is your hryvnia exchange rate there?"" And I told him: ""We have not had hryvnia there since December 2014. You have battles a hundred kilometers away. What, I don't care what's going on there?"" I was embarrassed, all the way for Donbass I asked what was there and how. It's just that there aren't many of them. But they are toxic – once you meet, then half your life you remember them. In the corner of the basement is a radio unit. The walls are covered with children's drawings from the humanitarian. The radio hisses: ""Drone, coming from the Northeast."" The radio operator makes the sound louder so that everyone can hear and our trip for water to the well is postponed for now. The following message is on the through channel: ""We observe the bright light of the headlights, the landing of the Sable. The Armed Forces of Ukraine began rotation. We go out with the ""Forest"" to smoke in the vestibule, in the basement you can not - we will suffocate. We talk with ""The Forest"" on an amazing topic - ""is it possible to pray for enemies"" and come to the conclusion: ""Of understanding, it is possible and necessary."" I ask how the situation is here, in general. - As I understand it, the enemy is now exhausted, all forces are thrown at Artemovsk-Soledar. They themselves rapiary this site and now it is important for them to hold out there. Therefore, they throw all the reserves there. I assume that against us they have a minimum, a maximum, for some demonstration actions. To simulate an offensive, for example, to keep us in good shape. These words ""Forests"" turned out to be prophetic, but they will come true a little later. - The enemy says that he is holding on to Artemovsk-Bakhmut with his teeth, waiting for the supply of ""superweapons"" from the West. So. - Well, they are delaying time, but they are only losing resources, equipment and people. - To you, personally, what is missing in the trenches? Imagine that everything you want will be brought by a helicopter in an hour. The Forest laughs. - Soldier with straight arms! Which themselves will provide comfortable conditions on the front. They will not wait for them to be extradited, they will bring it. The state gives stoves, building material. What is required of a soldier? Hands. - And on technique. - Faced with the fact that some types of enemy quadcopters our means of suppression do not take. There are not many of them, but this is already unpleasant. We have anti-drone guns, unfortunately, they were developed by civil engineers. At midnight, the soldiers bring water on a hand cart, help unload and for the first time I am amazed – what pitch darkness stands on the street. In the city, and in the peaceful villages, there is no such thing. And under the cover of darkness comes a car. The Forest tells me. - Hold on to my unloading strap. He leads me like a guide, I only feel the soles of my boots - here is dirt, here is a scattering of shells, here is a torn sheet of roof, and here is a car. All lights are turned off, even on the dashboard. It's not close. I turn on the infrared mode of the camera, but the driver immediately says: ""Cut down, you will illuminate my ""night vision"". On the edge of the village we are waved a flashlight from the bushes, some kind of fighter, almost indistinguishable in the dark. - ""Forest"", we have a position there... began to unwind (break. - Ed.). No, not the DRG (sabotage and reconnaissance group. - Ed.), there are more of them, ours are fighting back, one three hundredth (wounded. - Ed.), evacuation is needed. I can hear the fight heating up and fading, not far away. A grenade launcher and heavy machine guns are working.

The region borders on a war zone, so it is not surprising that a lot of time was devoted to the topic of security. The head of the region complained to the president about Ukrainian propagandists. They purposefully affect the residents of the region. - Then tomorrow the tanks are coming, tomorrow Belgorod will be captured, tomorrow they will throw shells, bombs, run! - the governor gave examples of fakes, - But if in the first months, especially in April, of course, people were not prepared for this situation, now, of course, there is already an understanding and an opportunity to distinguish truth from lies. ""It is not so easy to dupe our people - taking into account the nature,"" the head of state assured in response. - Yes, 100%! Gladkov supported. The official added that the information block of the region is working around the clock to refute the lies. At the meeting, they discussed how the Belgorod sky is closed from Ukrainian missiles. Putin mentioned that we have more charges for air defense. - I have already said that the fact that the United States produces Patriot missiles - in our country such missiles are produced three times more. Even more than three times,"" the president said. According to this, if we take air defense missiles for various purposes, then ""Russian production is comparable to the entire world production."" Putin also noted the efficiency of the complexes themselves. - Everything happens, but in general the system works properly. Practical combat work has shown that Russia's air defense is one of the best in the world,"" the Russian leader concluded. Unfortunately, even such air defense does not provide complete protection. - Ukraine, the enemy, is shelling peaceful settlements. We have 25 people killed and 96 people wounded,"" Gladkov reported. The governor said the families of dead and wounded civilians are receiving assistance from the region. - We made a decision from the beginning of a special military operation that in case of injury of moderate and severe severity, we pay 500 thousand, if the most severe occurs, when it dies - then we pay 3 million rubles. And we have extended these same decisions to civilians. We pay the same amounts from the budget as to military personnel,"" the head of the region said. READ ALSO.

The losses of the Ukrainian side are up to one and a half platoons. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the artillery of the Central Military District and the Airborne Forces struck at the 80th and 95th airborne assault brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Serebryansky forestry. Ukrainian paratroopers lost up to 70 fighters and two American radars AN/TPQ-37 and AN/TPQ-50. In the Donetsk direction, PMC fighters with the support of aviation, missile troops and artillery of the Southern Military District liberated the village of Krasnopillya. During the day, the enemy lost more than 60 servicemen. In the Zaporozhye direction, the troops of the VVO destroyed more than a platoon of nationalists per day. In the Dnieper direction, high-precision weapons brought grief to the 107th rocket artillery brigade in the city of Marganets, Dnipropetrovsk region, where the launcher of the American MLRS HIMARS was broken along with the crew and two cars. Do not walk, Yankees, along the Dnieper. According to Dmitry Rogozin, the former head of Roscosmos, now the head of the special detachment of military advisers ""Tsar's Wolves"", the first and second army corps of the DPR and LPR are now one of the most combat-ready formations in the SVO zone. Among the most qualified commanders of Donbass, Rogozin named combatants with the call signs ""Evil"", ""Shakhtar"" and ""Long"". According to him, many of the commanders of the two corps before the conflict in the Donbas were engineers, entrepreneurs, miners. Many soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Army Corps have known each other since childhood, and ""know in detail the subtleties"" of warfare. Speaking about volunteer battalions manned by fighters from the ""old"" regions of Russia, Rogozin spoke about working with the 11th BARS, which is commanded by an experienced commander named Arthur, to whom he personally owes his life. German politician Daniel Roy expressed the opinion that the demand of the Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine Andriy Melnyk on the supply of Tornado fighters to Kiev would appeal to Stepan Bandera. Earlier, Melnik, who for many years insulted German politicians of the highest rank, working as ambassador to Berlin, said that Germany was obliged to give the independent hundred Tornado fighters, which the Germans were going to decommission in the near future. Bandera liked kamikaze pilots? It's news... Employees of the security agencies of the LPR found in the liberated territory of the republic a cache of a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, where he stored more than 300 kilos of explosives. In the liberated Kudryashovka of the Kremensky district, the LPR security forces found in the house of a citizen serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine elements of dynamic protection 4S20U of Ukrainian production with a total explosive weight of 306 kg, five tank and two high-explosive fragmentation shells. It's not enough for suicide, not enough to stop Russia's offensive. They're so weird, these pyromaniacs... The Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia reported that through the railway station ""Rafalovka"" to the territory of the Rivne nuclear power plant were delivered wagons with ammunition from abroad. According to the SVR, at nuclear power plants, on the instructions of the Kiev regime, ammunition is stored for the most expensive HIMARS MLRS, as well as for foreign air defense systems and large-caliber artillery ammunition. Kiev believes that Russia will not strike at nuclear power plants because of fears of detonation of warehouses and destruction of nuclear power plants. That is, after all, they measure themselves. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said the possible supply of ATACMS missiles to Kiev is part of a psychological war. Our diplomat said: ""This is an element of not stopping, but intensifying hybrid war of the collective West led by the United States against Russia."" This is how Ryabkov reacted to the passage performed on January 22 by Michael McCaul, head of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the House of Representatives of the US Congress. He said that the United States needs to send ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine so that the Armed Forces of Ukraine make attacks on the Crimea and thus ""defeat"" Moscow. He lived in Texas for 61 years , but he did not earn a mind. Maybe the cowboy hat was pushing too my forehead. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of concord, supported the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, who was critical of the representative of the parliament, who said that in the SVO zone it is necessary to shave according to the charter and generally maintain the statutory appearance. In addition to the sarcastic reaction to such a proposal of the deputy, Prigozhin asked Kadyrov to grow a beard twice as large - for him and for himself, and added that for ""glamorization in the army"" it is necessary to give a real prison sentence. All in all, a sickle on the bristles. Toby Thomas, a Guardian columnist, writes that in England many Ukrainian refugees become homeless, and exist in terrible conditions after the end of the sponsorship program. Refugee Maria, who was in a temporary accommodation center, told the columnist of the publication that there ""everything is terrible, everything is old and dirty."" In this situation, at least a third of the more than 150 thousand Ukrainians who came to Britain under the sponsorship program. There are options: return home, where it is ""warm and bright"", or go to Africa, where it is also not cold and there is enough sun. The Russian Defense Ministry announced the start of construction of a water pipeline that will connect the Rostov region and the Donbass. The new hydraulic structure will pass through the territory of the Rostov region and the DPR to the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal. Up to 300 thousand cubic meters of water per day will go through the conduit. The project provides for the laying of two strands of the main pipeline of 200 kilometers each, the construction of pumping stations, power substations and water storage facilities for ten thousand cubic meters. 1600 military builders and about 800 units of equipment began to work.

The village of Krasnopolyivka near Soledar, liberated in the DPR, has been completely cleaned up, said the acting head of the republic, Denis Pushilin. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that the death toll since the beginning of the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the region has reached 25, and 96 people are wounded. In the Belgorod region, a 7-year-old boy saved the life of his little sister during the shelling of the village of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This was reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin on January 24 by the governor of the region Vyacheslav Gladkov. Tankers of the Western Military District destroyed the stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. An air alert was announced throughout Ukraine on January 24, 2023. The population is advised not to leave the shelters. Acting Governor of the Kherson region Volodymyr Saldo said that Ukrainian troops try to regularly cross the Dnieper, but always fail. Russian air defense systems shot down 10 Ukrainian drones per day. In the Donetsk direction, up to 50 Ukrainian militants were killed per day. Aviation of the Military Space Forces of Russia destroyed the Ukrainian installation of the Buk-M1 air defense system in the Kharkiv region.

It is not at all uncommon to have videos of men in women's coats, scarves and hats. And they are not supporters of non-traditional values, no! Here everything is like in the famous tale about Kerensky's escape from the Winter Palace in women's clothes - people are just trying to survive. One such video tells how the wife meets her husband Vitalik, who brought not only food, but also water, which earned special praise. Of course, after he proudly announced that no one recognized him, and no one even greeted him. Still - to find out such a miracle in a hat over a scarf in some windings is almost impossible. Except that all such maskers have one weak point - the size of the shoes. But in boots, this difference is not so noticeable. However, these videos, as well as those in which potential ""Batkivshchyna's ""zahisniks"" are screwed, twisted, caught up and beaten, caused an unequivocal negative reaction in Ukrainian society. As if Zelensky and his team had little negativity in recent days. And together with the British ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at a meeting with students, Volodymyr Zelensky decided to give an answer to the question tormenting the whole of Ukraine: the lawlessness of military commissariats (centers of territorial equipment - CTC) is his team or their own arbitrariness. Fortunately, a pre-prepared girl in camouflage (the same ""piano in the bushes"" - no vulgar hints) asked this question so politically correctly that it was possible not to answer - there were threats of aggression from Belarus, and about information fakes, and much more. - We can have military assistance in the form of equipment and so on, but if there are no personnel who manage this equipment, then what can we talk about? - Zelensky answered the question with a question and continued. - The task was set for the military, so that there was not just an addition to the personnel, but so that there were reserves, so that people could not only fight, but also recover, because it is difficult for various reasons - both injuries and moral and psychological state should be normal. Therefore, this is a task, the military have it. These are internal processes. Thus, although he was squirming, as if already in a frying pan, he still admitted that he had ordered mobilization, as he admitted, albeit softening further, the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had suffered catastrophic losses, which can be made up only by mobilization. However, he immediately tried to deflect the blow away from himself. They say that he only announced the need to solve the problem, and what the military began to create is their own ""combat"" merits and initiatives. ""The Supreme Commander-in-Chief's headquarters has made appropriate decisions, then the commanders in their directions should do this and do it - they build reserves and so on,"" Zelensky explained very confusingly. - I cannot say in detail how certain steps of the mobilization processes are going. They are there, they should be, they are very much needed. Indeed, this is a general deficit. Ukrainians are, you know, in short supply. If you continue in the same vein, Vovchik, you will soon run out of them. Unless, of course, they themselves start shooting back at those who intend to send them to the front. READ ALSO.

He visited Bucha, Borodyanka and met with Zelensky in Kyiv. Judging by the photos, the first two settlements clearly did not inspire him. Since the spring, when Johnson visited Bucha, almost nothing has changed in these towns. Except that in Bucha they removed the corpses of local residents neatly laid out by the VSUshniki for foreign guests, and the new ones were not decomposed. - Boris Johnson was surprised by the scale of the destruction of Borodyanka, which was inflicted by Russian troops on our village. He also looked at how the work is going to restore the destroyed infrastructure. Johnson asked about programs to restore Tsentralnaya Street, which suffered the most during the fighting, and said that Britain will continue to help Ukraine fight and restore destruction, - told reporters the details of Johnson's stay in Borodyanka, the acting chairman of the Borodyansky city council Georgy Yerko. If you call a spade a spade, then Johnson is convinced that no restoration work is underway in these cities. Neither the rubble has been cleared, nor even the glass in the windows has been inserted. But it was Johnson who made so many statements about programs to restore Ukraine that a normal person would have already erased the language. Not only did Johnson leave Kiev, satisfying only Zelensky, who once again told Boris how Ukraine wants to join NATO, he also received a slap in the back for the fact that Western allies do not insert windows and repair the walls of houses destroyed during hostilities. - A friend of Ukraine, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Bucha and Borodyanka today. Let me remind you that the British Kingdom is responsible for the restoration of the Kyiv region, however, not a single project has yet been implemented. The main trouble is that the houses that were promised to be restored in Borodyanka before December 15 have not yet been completed. People still have leaking roofs, no windows inserted. - said the deputy from the party of Zelensky ""Servant of the People"" Olga Vasilevskaya-Smaglyuk and gave the former Prime Minister of Great Britain a chance to improve. - I hope that Johnson, after what he saw, motivates the local authorities to fulfill their promises, and British investors to invest in the restoration and construction of new facilities. This British kingdom, it turns out, is responsible for the restoration of the Kiev region, and the Ukrainian authorities themselves and Zelensky personally have nothing to do with it. What's there to ask of him? It is urgent to send the royal guardsmen with hammers, screwdrivers, jackhammers and other tools.

Ten months have passed since the liberation of the Kyiv region, and they do not itch,"" she said. - And in general, it is a horror when the authorities shift responsibility for weapons, and for restoration, for social security and humanitarian aid to our partners and through a marathon forms infantile consumer sentiments in society. One might think that Poroshenko did not say in the same way that the whole world owes Ukraine, and everyone owes them whatever they ask.

Petty Officer Almaz Safin died of his wounds after the battle, completing the combat mission to the end. His heroic and decisive actions, combined with high professionalism and skillful leadership of the personnel, made it possible to prevent the breakthrough of the trained and equipped, numerically superior units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which suffered significant damage. "" As it became known KP.RU, Petty Officer Almaz Safin was a professional soldier. He served under contract in the Ministry of Defense of Russia for more than eight years, participated in the operation in Syria. He came from the village of Raevsky, Alsheyevsky District, Bashkortostan, where he will always be remembered by his relatives and friends. Almaz Safin's aunt Zilya Chupova: ""He has an older brother Dinislam, an older sister Dinara, Almaz is the youngest in the family. After the end of his military service, in retirement, he wanted to return and live in Bashkortostan, he said that the soul was drawn to his native places. His eldest son is 15 years old, his daughters are 10 and 6 years old. My mother went to visit them in Novosibirsk. And Almaz himself came to Bashkortostan a couple of times a year on vacation. I met with all my relatives, a very open, kind, sociable person. Now such people are rare. Last year, Almaz and his children came on vacation. He did not speak to his mother, but, as if jokingly, he said to us: ""I am leaving for Ukraine."" Of course, we tried to dissuade him, because he has a family, three children. No, he was sure that he should do this: ""I went to Syria, how can I not protect my country."" Although, as a father of three, he could have received a reprieve. But he left. ""I am a military man, this is my life, my profession, everything is fine, I have a guardian angel, my father sees me. Dad wanted me to be courageous. Then who will protect you here girls? I'm going to go there, none of you will know,"" he said. Almaz's colleague Vadim Ramazanov: ""He served at the Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School, where the whole institute knows him. A real man, a man of his word. He took me to serve in his company. His character, his spirit, was such that he, in spite of everything, fulfilled the task. And we were taught to be like that. This person is my teacher, my mentor. He played an important role in my formation, hardened my character, taught me how to perform life's tasks. "" Lieutenant Chermen SHAWLOHO. ""The platoon of Lieutenant Chermen Shavlokhov guarded the movement of Russian equipment and units on the march. Following the route, Russian servicemen noticed the movement of an enemy sabotage group. Chermen made the decision - secretly approaching the positions of the nationalists, to deliver a sudden blow. Having taken advantageous positions, Shavlokhov's platoon opened targeted fire on Ukrainian militants. Having suffered serious losses in manpower, the surviving nationalists laid down their arms and surrendered. During the interrogation, the militants revealed the location of their artillery positions. During reconnaissance by an unmanned aerial vehicle in the area indicated by the captured nationalists, enemy artillery positions were detected. An airstrike was carried out on the detected positions, as a result of which 4 self-propelled artillery pieces, 8 cars and more than 20 nationalists. The coordinated actions of the platoon under the command of Lieutenant Chermen Shavlokhov made it possible to disrupt the upcoming provocations against Russian troops and eliminate a large number of enemy personnel and equipment. "" Senior Lieutenant Roman TIMOFEE. ""Senior Lieutenant Roman Timofeev, performing tasks as part of a group of engineering units, disrupted the offensive of Ukrainian militants in one of the tank-dangerous areas during the defense of one of the settlements. Being at the forefront, Roman discovered the advance of the enemy in the direction of the defensive positions of the Russian units. A platoon of engineering obstacles under the competent leadership of Roman Timofeev, despite the numerical superiority of the nationalists and the artillery shelling that began, imposed the battle on the enemy and completed the combat task of installing engineering obstacles, thereby disrupting the rapid enemy offensive. Competently leading his subordinates, Roman together with the platoon destroyed 3 enemy tanks and BMPs, as well as 10 nationalists. As a result of the battle, the enemy group suffered serious losses and fled the battlefield."" Private Ayur PAPAE. ""Private Ayur Papaev carried out a combat mission to protect and defend the firing position of an artillery unit as an observer of the air situation. During the observation in a given sector, Ayur found an unknown copter-type unmanned aerial vehicle approaching the firing position, which he immediately reported to the command. Having ascertained that there were no Russian unmanned aerial vehicles in the given sector, Private Papaev shot down enemy damage with aimed fire, which fell in the forest belt adjacent to the positions of our artillerymen. After conducting search activities, the fallen drone was discovered. During the inspection of the drone, memory cards were found, according to which the enemy positions were identified. After confirmation of the data by aerial reconnaissance, an artillery strike was carried out on the positions of the militants. The professionalism of Private Papaev made it possible to identify the hidden positions of the militants and hit them before the offensive begins."" LISTEN AS WELL.

In the hope, for example, that the Russians will not hit civilian targets, they have already hidden mercenary detachments and weapons depots in them many times. Sometimes they hooked wagons with military equipment to passenger trains, then they carried shells and Javelins in trucks with the inscription ""Mail"" or with a sign of the International Red Cross. Many times it happened that militants took refuge in kindergartens, hospitals, shopping centers and residential buildings. But, it turned out, these were ""flowers"". And the ""berries"" are here. Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia Sergei Naryshkin made a sensational statement. - There are reliable reports that the Ukrainian armed forces are stockpiling weapons and ammunition provided by the West at nuclear power plants. This applies to expensive and scarce for the Armed Forces of Ukraine missiles for HIMARS MLRS complexes and foreign air defense systems, as well as large-caliber artillery ammunition. So to the Rivne nuclear power plant in the west of Ukraine delivered several wagons of deadly cargo. Naryshkin also explained that Ukraine is doing this on the assumption that Russia will not strike at the nuclear power plant, and if the ammunition detonates ""through the fault of another ""lost"" missile of the Ukrainian air defense, then the blame for the tragedy can always be attributed to Moscow."" According to Naryshkin, this is a method that is often used by international terrorists. Only in the hostages of the Kiev regime now are hundreds of thousands of residents of their own country and neighboring states. The press service of the SVR added that the plan of the Kiev regime is clear: ""Just as the Banderaites shell the cities of Donbass from behind the backs of innocent civilians, the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine hides ammunition in the rear, hiding behind nuclear reactors. By the way, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided to place its missions at all Ukrainian nuclear power plants. They have already arrived at the South-Ukrainian nuclear power plant (Mykolaiv region), as well as at Rivne. But what is alarming is that, unlike Russian intelligence, for some reason they do not yet ""see"" the warehouses of missiles and ammunition. And how can you not think that the IAEA, apparently, deliberately turns a blind eye to what could become a tragedy of a continental scale. I don't want to believe it, but... Russia still hopes that in Ukraine no one will think of deliberately detonating ammunition at a nuclear power plant, in the hope of begging the United States for even more weapons. And the main thing is to accuse Russia of a nuclear catastrophe of a pan-European scale. READ ALSO.

In the city of Skole, Stryi district, Lviv region, relatives and friends were burying the deceased soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when suddenly the military in camouflage joined the funeral procession. ""The twins have come to pay their last respects to the fallen warrior,"" sobbed someone walking behind the coffin. Yeah, sort of. The military, who turned out to be representatives of the local military recruitment office with the support of the police, bypassed all the men who came to see off the deceased on the last journey and quickly distributed summonses for mobilization to each of them. Nothing personal, but it's time for you to go back to where it was brought from the day before. And then to where you're taking it now. And it's not a joke. This is the harsh reality of today's Ukraine. In all the cities of which now the military, accompanied by the police, are arranging real roundups on potential ""gravelized"". The web is full of videos of this ""suicide hunt"". No longer summonses are handed over, but simply taken from where they were caught and immediately taken to the territorial center of team formation. Those who try to resist, wring their hands - the police have the skills of fighting and detaining are worked out on hooligans, and in such a team several soldiers are always accompanied by several healthy boogeymen from the police. Those who try to escape catch up, knock them down and knit just as hard as ordinary troublemakers. During raids in markets and shopping centers (and there are real raids), the teams are clearly divided into ""standing on the numbers"" and beaters driving the ""game"" to these ""numbers"". It's like a real hunt. Women who try to beat their own from the ""gravediggers"" are not ceremonial to the point of using batons. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine admitted yesterday or the day before yesterday that the number of mobile groups in the country ""handing out agendas"" has been increased to 3,000. And all of them are reinforced by servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Even if there are only four soldiers in such a group, then this is already 12 thousand servicemen who pay their debt to Batkivshchyna not at the front, but in the rear, catching a new ""cannon fodder"", which they are waiting for - they will not wait at the front. Even if it is untrained, the path is sick, and even tuberculosis patients and the blind are mobilized in one eye. Because Zelensky set the task of recruiting at least 300,000 new bayonets into the army in order to be able to patch up losses and hold the front until the arrival of elite units trained in the West. And this meat can be sacrificed. And, of course, as always in such a situation, the places of those who drive and catch have become a dream for many. According to information that is not a secret to anyone in Ukraine, it is very difficult and very costly to get a job as a military recruiting ""runner"" or ""beater"". Depending on the region, you need to pay from 10 thousand to 20 thousand US dollars. And they won't take everyone. A person on the street, without a credible recommendation, can rustle bills for as long as he wants, but will be left with nothing. In the military enlistment office, too, there are no fools who know that any such ""person who wants to cut off"" can be a figurehead from counterintelligence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs or other law enforcement agencies who are asleep and see how to put his little man in the place of a particular military commissar, who will direct financial streams in the ""right"" direction. But the flow of those who want to catch other fellow citizens does not dry up. Many borrow the necessary amounts, because these 10-20 thousand bucks are fought off in a couple of days. And for a decade, if you don't take much risk. And all this against the backdrop of endless caravans with the dead, which deliver bodies from near Bakhmut (Artemovsk), Soledar and other places throughout Independence. Moreover, if earlier they tried not to mobilize those liable for military service from Western Ukraine, now they are rowing everyone and everywhere. Not to fat. Zelensky needs to hold on and hold the front. By any means and means. It doesn't matter how they fight, how or what they don't want to and won't fight. It will take some time for the Russians to kill them, and Zelensky needs time now. He admitted it himself. Let them die, but give him an extra hour and an extra day. As it turned out, the war to the last Ukrainian is not just a beautiful phrase, but a harsh reality. LISTEN AS WELL. Large-scale changes are coming to the Russian army (more)"

The legendary commander of the vostok battalion on what the special operation taught","The legendary commander of the vostok battalion, Alexander Khodakovsky, and the Komsomolka military commander Dmitry Steshin tried to figure out what the special operation taught us.","Alexander Sergeyevich Khodakovsky will soon have his tenth year of fighting in the Donbas. The KP military officer has the same numbers. There is something to remember, something to compare. Including a special operation. My first question was general, global. - What has changed in military affairs, in our worldview from the first days of the beginning of the SVO and from the beginning of mobilization. ""We survived two stages of the special operation,"" Khodakovsky said. - The first is intense, when we spent all our funds and went, went forward. We reached the limit of our capabilities and stopped. Then there was a stage when, for various reasons, we temporarily ceded territory to the enemy. No one likes that. On the other hand, it gives additional motivation to win. - But we have achieved something. - The Sea of Azov has become our internal sea. We have taken control of very important territories and logistics areas. - ""Land Corridor"" to Crimea. -Yes. And they retained control over these areas, no matter what. And all this together now formed the basis of the third stage, I believe. Because we analyzed all our successes and failures, made a difficult decision to mobilize. It is difficult both politically and in terms of the state's readiness for such tasks. Huge masses sometimes arrived at dilapidated assembly points, sometimes warmed up by the fires, ate incomprehensibly how. Everything had to be learned anew, on the go. - The main lesson. - Now we do not overestimate our strength, we have seen the capabilities of the enemy. For example, in the autumn in the Artyomovsk direction, they continued to press, even when the right and left five. - How did we do it. - It turned out that if desired, we can modernize the organization of the battle. We can apply methods that are atypical for the army. - If it's not a secret, which ones. - Our main problems are a very long time of decision-making for everything. Simplified. That is, I see the goal – I see no obstacles. Maximum elimination of obstacles. And all this has now brought us to some kind of meaningfulness. Not on euphoria, not on overestimation of their own forces or the forces of the enemy. A more sober, realistic attitude to what is happening. We have laid the third stage, which is about to begin. I hope. - It is clear that information about the enemy's losses, his mood and combat capability is classified. Your opinion. - In most areas, the enemy has now minimized its presence (Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. - Author), took away all the reserves and transferred them. How many through Soledar, how many through the same Artemovsk passed the active units of the Ukrainian, and in what condition they came out of these meat grinders can be guessed. It's the same story on any site. For example, near Donetsk - Marinka, Avdiivka, where we are making efforts to move forward. There, the enemy organizes defense mainly due to the increased consumption of its resources. Accordingly, in other areas where the situation is more or less static, his strength is decreasing. - These maneuvers of the enemy with resources, they are a good sign for us. - The enemy feels not very comfortable even in a tactical sense. Although I understand that it still retains some offensive capabilities, and somewhere we will see the introduction of these reserves. But if we talk about the strategic state of the enemy, we understand that he has already reached his limit. - A growing Western aid. - No matter how much equipment the West supplies, and the queen of the fields is still infantry. If Ukraine is already so ruthlessly mobilizing the last people who tried to avoid it, that is, the most low-motivated people - they are caught anywhere and quickly sent into battle through the ""take-off-landing"" courses - this indicates that the resource is depleted. They are trying to fight on the principle that the best of the best have already been knocked out, let's get the best of the worst. Then there will be just the worst of the worst. - Our ""main military secret"" has been earned. - We have always known that we are strong in the game in the long run: first we swing, and then we begin to catch up and after that it is very difficult to stop us. - There is no doubt that no one will ""freeze"" the SVO and turn it into protracted ""trench fighting"". So they have to attack? On the Ukrainian side, they are also talking about their offensive. They give different dates. Where is the reality here, where are the fantasies, and where is the propaganda? What it might look like. - On such a long line of contact there will be different tactics, it seems to me that everything will begin to fluctuate fractionally. Somewhere the Armed Forces of Ukraine will begin to actively act according to the already drawn up plans, based on the accumulated mass of people and equipment. And somewhere we will begin to act. Somewhere we will meet each other halfway, somewhere - to pre-emptively. But there will still be their own basic principles for everyone. -What. - For the enemy - to stretch us to diametrically opposite sides. They have already used this tactic once, intensified in the south, near Kherson, and in the north, near Balakliya. And where it got through, that's where they went on the offensive. If it worked once, why wouldn't they try a second one? It's easier for Ukraine in this way. -Why. -Logistics. On their part, a very developed network of both railways and highways. And we have to move troops along the maximum circumference, along the arc. There are many such factors that can influence both in our favor and in theirs. And I think the third stage will be very dynamic. Well, on what frontiers we will stop - we will already see there. - Armchair experts criticize us for blowing head-on at long-built fortified areas. It is enough to look at the course of the battles for Avdiivka, Maryinka, Soledar, Bakhmut - we really break head-on. There is an excuse for this. - Rather than an excuse, but an explanation. To deploy in the operational spaces, to take in the coverage of large settlements, it is necessary to have much greater resources. Then it would be possible to surround the entire Donbas grouping of the enemy and keep it in the ring. - How many resources are needed. - According to my calculations, it is the same as we have now. Plus, reserves. Therefore, in order not to lose the advantage and impose the initiative on the enemy, we have to go frontally. And resting on some city, we have only two options. Either stop and continue not to fight, but only to throw shells, or try to still take cities. But due to the inability to cover them, it turns out to take only in the forehead, moving forward progressively. - Yes, I can imagine how many resources were used to block Mariupol. - Now the situation is different, and the mobilized are not yet quite ready for such actions. Not fully trained. Maximum efficiency will not be squeezed out. - What do we do with efficiency. - We need to change people's minds. Change the motivation system so that they strive for the result. When, for example, in my regular unit there is infantry and there is artillery that covers this infantry, then every infantryman can then come to the gunner and give him in the face - what are you, bastard, we laid down, and you stopped firing? I had situations when the commander of a mortar battery sat for a day under administrative punishment in a cage for the fact that they did not have time to impose gunpowder (to increase the firing range, additional powder charges are fixed on mortar mines. – Author). At the time of the offensive, there was a gag, and the infantry was left without fire cover. That is, the enemy calmly worked on our infantry, put it face down in the ground, and the mortarmen at that moment tied the gunpowder. A reasonable question – why didn't you tie up in advance? Did you understand the intensity with which ammunition would have to be spent in the midst of the offensive? And it turns out that the result depends on a person's thinking, and not only on the amount of ammunition. - In my opinion, we were able to close the problem with drones, saturating the front line with quadcopters. I just brought two pieces from Moscow, with good thermal imagers. - No, this problem is not solved that way. The range of quadcopters is limited. And at those distances where they can fly, there are not so many serious targets, that for artillery, that for dropped mines. In this zone, everyone is buried as much as possible, the shelters are durable, because it ""arrives"" here. The personnel are the most vigilant. And no one is in the front lines holding a large number of people, because the losses will be large. What can quadcopters see? Maybe a ""cheeky"" mortar, some kind of rotation. Some mobilized people, whom no one in Ukraine feels sorry for: ""Sit here, your position is advanced, it is also observant and, if the enemy goes on the offensive, your task is to open fire and hold it back for a while, and we will meet him as expected on the second line."" Therefore, copters do not solve the front-line problem. - I also do not remember that our copters were bombed, for example, by enemy artillery... - Copters do not reach serious artillery positions that work from a distance of 10-12 kilometers. - It turns out that the enemy has a ""security zone"". - The key here is that no one will give a Iskander or a Kalibr to destroy artillery. Because any self-propelled gun is cheaper than kalibr. And it turns out that we have a big gap between serious means, such as Kalibr, which hit far away, and non-serious ones, like 120th mortars or 122nd guns, self-propelled guns or towed D-30s. Between them there remains a long distance, not closed by anything. And the search for funds that will close this average distance, from 7 to 25-30 kilometers, is now a big task. - A ""Tornado"" or ""Hurricane"". - Firstly, there are few of them, and secondly, the wear of the barrels. Where there are 300, for example, flights, there are already two thousand. Accordingly, not everyone gets in for sure, and something needs to be done about it. Because it is from this distance that they hit our infantry. - Of the announced regular deliveries of Western weapons, what worries you. - For some reason it seems to me that everyone is burning. Universal things that can protect the tank from weapons of destruction have not yet been invented. Both active protection and passive protection, regardless of anything, are bypassed. Therefore, only concentration, quantity can be disturbing. If they smear all those Bradleys and Leopards all over the line of contact, it won't make the weather. They will simply close the holes that were formed as a result of our destruction of their Soviet-style armored vehicles. But if they concentrate all this on some area where they try to attack, this, of course, will be a significant factor. We must try to take preventive measures. - The head of our foreign intelligence said that Poland plans to occupy its ""historical possessions"" in Ukraine. And this is a NATO country. Are the Poles ready to fight us. - It's definitely not PR. Poles hate us fiercely. They are the most inveterate of all our historical adversaries, as they like to say. The most hysterical, existential. Because if the West, it looks at us in cold blood, rationally, without breathing, without a spiritual need to destroy us, then for the Poles it is at the level of seething blood. And it seems to me that they are just now spilling all this out, sublimating them in the opportunity to realize their hatred with the hands of Ukrainians. It's something very strange and scary at the same time. They also put many Ukrainian slaves on the stake at one time, in the XVI-XVII century, when the lords ruled in Ukraine. Ukraine has long forgotten this, so they allowed themselves to be drawn into this Polish yoke for the second time. I think the Poles, as direct representatives of the United States in Europe, are now very much interested in controlling the processes in Ukraine. And they implement this very systematically.

The website of the KP.RU publishes online the latest news about Russia's military special operation in Ukraine on January 29, 2023. An air alert was announced in a number of regions of Ukraine on January 28, 2023. The population of the regions is advised to stay in shelters. Rosgvardia reported the destruction of the parking lot of boats of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for crossing the Dnieper. Seven caches have been reportedly discovered. Against the background of western supplies to Ukraine and serious pressure from the Russian Armed Forces in the eastern and south-eastern directions, the Russian troops are moving to new tactics of warfare, including an attack on the garrisons of Ukraine in the rear, as well as a counterattack on the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This conclusion was reached by the military commander of Komsomolskaya Pravda Alexander Kots. Russian fighters shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 in the DPR. In addition, Russian air defense systems shot down nine Ukrainian drones. Russian troops destroyed a group of Ukrainian saboteurs near Avdiivka. The Russian military hit 86 units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 124 districts. In various directions, Russian troops killed more than 145 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian troops killed more than 50 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Krasnolimansky direction. During the offensive, the Russian Armed Forces defeated three brigades of the Ukrainian army there. The Armed Forces of Ukraine struck a hospital in Novoaidar of the LPR, killing 14 people. Another 24 people were injured. The Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled a hospital in Nova Kakhovka, Kherson region, with artillery.

""These questions are not within my competence,"" the writer's spokeswoman replied. - Zakhar has been retrained. - Yes, he has already passed the coordination with the unit and moved to the front line. He has experience, as he served in the riot police. Indeed, Zakhar Prilepin in 1994 was called up for military service, which he preferred to take place in the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia. After that, he entered the Nizhny Novgorod Law Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, from where in 1996 he went with a unit to Chechnya. He served in the riot police until 1999, and after receiving higher education he resigned. In 2015, Prilepin went to Donbas. In 2017, he became the deputy commander of the special forces battalion for work with the personnel of the DPR army - zampolit, with the rank of major. So now he has taken the position of commander of the special forces unit. In which direction of the line of contact with the Armed Forces of Ukraine the writer will appear is not reported. As it became known KP.RU during retraining on the basis of Rosgvardia, Major Zakhar Prilepin assembled a special unit that will perform special tasks.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712023/,Victor BARANETS,2023-01-26,"How Russia will stop NATO's tank armada in Ukraine: Leopard vs. Breakthrough, Abrams against General Frost",Military observer Viktor Baranets said that Russia can counter NATO tanks in Ukraine,"So, for the first time since the Great Patriotic War, German tanks will be thrown against our army. I wonder if they will be smeared with crosses? Or vice versa - they will draw the SS lightning and fascist runes of the Ukrainian Nazbats. The United States and other NATO countries promised Ukraine hordes of ""armor"" - tanks, infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), and armored personnel carriers. Some Americans are already preparing to send Kiev 31 Abrams tanks, about 100 Bradley IFVs and about the same number of Stryker armored fighting vehicles. Together with this iron alone, it is already being recruited for a motorized infantry division. And the colonies of the United States in Europe - Poles, British, Germans, Spaniards, Danes, Dutch, Norwegians also promise to ""throw off"". Only one Leopard tank will be collected under two hundred. The Germans are already shipping a dozen of their Leopards, the British are promising to transfer 14 Challengers, and the French - about 30 modern Leclers. Moreover, they decided to sell or donate tanks to Ukraine not only to NATO countries (12 out of 30 of them), but also their allies - Australia, South Korea, Japan ... So it is not yet possible to accurately calculate all its number. But it is already clear that the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Zaluzhny - ""Give me 300 tanks and 600-800 BMPs and I will be able to advance, including on the Crimea"" - it seems that NATO will fulfill. Biden even blurted out, announcing the supply of Abrams: ""Ukraine promised to advance."" Someone in the West has already nicknamed all this collection of combat vehicles the ""tank coalition"". And, of course, it should not be underestimated. But no one is going to raise their hands up in advance. Let's take a better look – how can we stop this NATO tank armada? Can our tanks or other Russian weapons smash it? If we evaluate the tank ""zoo"" promised to Kiev, the main threat to us will come from the German Leopards. Judging by the name of this machine, it grew up in the same German ""menagerie"" as the ""Tigers"" with the ""Panthers"", which our grandfathers burned well in the fields of the Great Patriotic War. ""Liverwurst"" (as the Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin called German Chancellor Scholz), as we see, could not resist US pressure. Scholz initially said that German tanks in the former Soviet Union would evoke ""bad associations."" And now I've changed my mind. And he sends ""Leopards"" to Ukraine with the same German crosses on their sides. These tanks are even made at the same factory where tigers and Panthers were once riveted. Well, what kind of beast is this - a modern German ""cat"". Germans believe that their modern Leopard is the best in the world and has no equal. Although, unlike our T-90, it has a much lower degree of protection (we will talk about our machine later). The main armament of the German is a smoothbore gun of 120 mm caliber. The range of aimed fire is 3.5 km, in motion - 2.5 km. The sight for this tank was developed by Zeiss. However, it may not be needed. Fire control systems only allow the gunner to select a target and impose a marker on it. The tank will do the rest itself. The engine of the ""Leopard"" - with a capacity of 1500 hp With a weight of 55 tons on the highway, the tank can be accelerated to 72 km / h, and along the fields - up to 40 km / h. But there are ""Leopard"" and disadvantages. The tank is large and it is more difficult to ""hide"" it than Russian vehicles. The Leopard has a large gun mask. Hitting it does not leave the tank without a gun. And a huge gunner's sight, which creates a vulnerable zone in the frontal armor. Another drawback is the general booking. The most vulnerable is the hull, and the most durable place is the left side of the forehead of the tower. In general, this is a very serious machine, the combat capabilities of which cannot be belittled. Well, as next to the ""Leopard"" looks like its main competitor - our T-90. The Russian modernized T-90 tank (aka ""Breakthrough"") in terms of protection and armament is much superior to the main German Leopard. The only thing in which the T-90 loses is in the power plant - the engine power is less than that of the German - 1100 ""horses"". But, on the other hand, it is lighter - weight - up to 48 tons. The advantage of the Russian tank is in the power of the gun - it is of 125 mm caliber, and the T-90 can conduct aimed fire at a distance of 5 km, almost twice as far as the Leopard. In this case, the German tank may not have time to approach the Russian one on the battlefield. The T-90 has powerful anti-shell armor. But in addition to traditional armor and dynamic protection, the tank is equipped with the Shtora-1 complex - this is protection against anti-tank guided missiles. There is also a system for installing curtains of external camouflage. Among the Russian tanks already in service, the most protected is the T-90M. The frontal armor of its turret will withstand the hit of the most sophisticated American shells of Abrams tanks. Who else besides the Leopards can appear on the battlefield in the Ukrainian steppes? What are their advantages and weaknesses. Let's take a quick look at them. U.S. Abrams tank. This is a very serious opponent. Dignity. - High rate of fire of a 105 mm gun - up to 10-12 rounds per minute. - Powerful armor of the frontal part of the vehicle. - Navigation and friend-or-foe identification system. The crew sees through space satellites on their electronic map all the tanks on the battlefield, and most importantly - which of them is their own. - Ammunition is stored in a protected compartment. This increases the survivability of the machine and crew. - Powerful engine - 1500 hp Gas turbine provides quick start and acceleration. - Modern electronics, excellent means of observation. Disadvantages. - Sides with weak armor, vulnerable even to old grenade launchers. And the rear of the tank is even for BMP guns. - There are no guided weapons, unlike most modern tanks (which reduces the range of fire. - It is possible to defeat the turret of the auxiliary power plant on the stern even with a large-caliber machine gun. - The inability to control an anti-aircraft machine gun from the turret. - Easily hit from above by high-precision ammunition. ""Abrams"" is a serious, but extremely heavy machine, heavier than all its ""classmates"". Weight reaches 68 tons. Americans claim that thanks to this, the Abrams is better protected. His armor is considered the best in the class (well, the Americans have all the ""best in the world""). But it's mostly on the front of the tank. And anti-tank missiles are used, as a rule, on the side. Where the armor is thinner. For example, Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down at least 20 Abrams. Due to the heavy weight, the tank has the smallest power reserve, it is extremely voracious. Of the significant advantages of the Abrams - its armor-piercing shells are more effective, they were developed recently, and ours - under the USSR. The big advantage of Russian tanks is that they are two or three times cheaper! The export value of the T-90S is $ 2.5 million, and the T-90MS - up to $ 4 million, while the new Western tanks cost at least $ 6 million. ""Abrams"" - about $ 8-9 million. So far, they have only been tested in combat in the Middle East. In the sands. And in Ukraine now it is winter, snow, ice or impassable mud. There is a video on the Internet of Abrams unable to enter a snow-covered hill and slides backwards. However, when the ground dries up and hardens in the spring, the Abrams may frolic... But! One of Russia's leading military experts, Viktor Murakhovsky, is convinced that NATO tanks are ill-suited for combat in Ukraine. - 55% of the territory of Ukraine is considered a closed area with a line of sight range of less than 500 meters. The share of distances up to 2000 and 2500 meters - accounts for only 16% of the territory. In addition, not all tanks of NATO countries, unlike Russian ones, are equipped with dynamic protection against cumulative ammunition. Given these two factors, Western tanks will confidently penetrate from Russian guns. German combat armored vehicle ""Marder. Dignity. - Strong armor for this class of vehicles. It is designed to protect against 30-mm Russian guns that are on our main BMP-2. - Good cross-country ability and maneuverability. - Decent armament - 20 mm automatic cannon, machine gun and anti-tank missiles. Disadvantages. - The machine is heavy - up to 33 tons. - The armor on the sides made it impossible for the paratroopers to fire from the vehicle. - Very expensive and difficult to maintain. Infantry fighting vehicle ""Bradley"" (USA. Advantages. - Experience has shown that the ""aluminum"" armor of the vehicle is reliable and withstands the hit of Soviet 30-mm shells. - The 25-mm automatic gun allows you to effectively deal with lightly armored targets and provide fire support to the infantry. - Bradley has a good installation of TOW homing missiles capable of reaching any observed tank within a radius of 4 km. Disadvantages. - High maintenance cost. - The machine is heavy - 35 tons. By weight, it approaches  Tanks. - Poor permeability and stability. - Number of paratroopers - 6 people with 3 crew members - the ratio is nowhere worse. - Compared to our IFVs, the car is hefty and this is a disadvantage on the battlefield, this cannot be taken away. The Stryker is an SS armoured fighting vehicle. Dignity. - Armor protects the crew from 14.5 mm bullets from the side and stern and 30 mm shells from the forehead. - Bulletproof tires are equipped with a pumping system. - A system of digital data exchange between machines and units. Immediately 7 (seven!) periscopes and a display of thermal imaging and video cameras. Disadvantages. - Too large size with little volume inside. - Armor does not ""hold"" modern anti-tank weapons. The Challenger is a British main tank. Dignity. - One of the most protected tanks in the world. - Turret of improved design (reduced radar visibility). - 120 mm gun with chrome plating of the barrel channel, which increased its resource. Disadvantages. - Low reliability of the machine. - Inconvenience of the crew. - Archaic fire control system. The main French tank ""Leclerc. Dignity. - Maneuverability thanks to the powerful 1500-force V-8 engine and automatic transmission. - High degree of automation of systems (electronic stuffing - half the cost of the tank). - Armor is modular, which simplifies the replacement of damaged elements. - The roof of the tower is heavily protected. - The fire control system takes into account all possible corrections, including the bending of the barrel. Disadvantages. - The car is capricious, the electronics often fail. Now the French army has 256 tanks, but only 42 of them are ""on the go"", the rest are mothballed, because there is no money to maintain them. - There is no dynamic protection (the French abandoned it, arguing that it was a danger to their own infantry). - The Leclerc has a stabilized 120 mm smoothbore gun, which gives a greater initial velocity of the projectile, but the resource of the gun is only 400 rounds. How can we destroy all these Abrams, Leopards, Challengers and Leclers. Well, with them - the whole ""brood"" of NATO IFVs. Our modern T-90 tank immediately comes to mind. Well, and the upgraded T-72B3. But a tank duel, when a tank goes against a tank, as in the Kursk arc, is a rarity in modern battles. All this will be done during the general battle, under the cover of our combat vehicles supporting BMPT tanks with the formidable name ""Terminator"" (it has 4 laser-guided anti-tank missiles ""Attack"" and 2 grenade launchers). Dangerous for the latest NATO tanks and Russian armor-piercing and subcaliber shells ""Lead-1"" made of uranium alloy. They are capable of penetrating 700 mm of steel armor (this is the ""forehead"" of the Abrams turret). And less protected tanks - ""Leopard"", ""Challenger"" or ""Leclerc"" will be hit even more often. The Russian army now has about 2,000 tanks that can use such shells. Well, what else are we going to ""spoil Western military equipment"". Alexander Kochetkov, Reserve Colonel, Design Engineer. - We have an impressive ""set"" of anti-tank weapons. But most of them are half a century old. For example, the 2A46 gun (adopted in 1970) or the Rapira anti-tank gun (created in the late 1960s). You will laugh, but with skillful use, shells from them can ""hole the barrel"" of the most modern NATO tanks. There are, of course, other means to combat the Abrams and Leopards. They can even be hit head-on by anti-tank missiles ""Vikhr-1"", which are on Ka-52 helicopters. They are capable of penetrating armor up to 1200 mm. And there are also Attack-V missiles that penetrate up to 1000 mm of armor. A serious danger for NATO ""zhelezyak"" - and anti-tank complex ""Kornet-D1"". For example, the BMP-2M launches its missiles in a salvo. As a result, the active protection of the enemy tank will shoot down the first missile, and the second will hit the target. Our RPG-30 ""Hook"" hand grenade launcher works according to the same scheme for combat at short distances, up to 200 meters. He's not bad for battling the Bradleys, the Strykers or the Marders."" We have a set of reliable ""old men"", and more or less modern means: ""Bassoon"", ""Baby"", ""Contest"", ""Metis"", ""Sturm""... And this, without taking into account the promising developments, that are being prepared for adoption into service right now at an accelerated pace. The situation obliges... And here the question inevitably arises: is it possible to destroy NATO tanks on the approach to the front line? A tank is not a matchbox, it is difficult to hide. However, hitting ""Kalibr"" on echelons with military equipment or highways with tractors is not so easy. ""Calibers"" hit standing targets, not moving ones. Is there no solution to the problem? Probably is. These are massive strikes on major railway junctions, through which trains will flow from the West to Ukraine. And, finally, the release of sabotage groups that will derail trains with military equipment. The situation will inevitably force us to look for the most effective options. And the goal is clear - to make NATO supplies to Ukraine meaningless. Question of the day: When can NATO's tank armada reach the battlefield? It is already sliding into Poland in small batches. Training of Ukrainian crews is underway... Recently, a Polish officer ""on camera"" admitted that his colleagues were persuaded to sign a contract - to go to fight in tanks in Ukraine. There are few applicants. But the signal is alarming... It is obvious that Ukrainian generals (and their advisers from the United States and Britain) will not ""smear armor"" along all 1,000 kilometers of the line of combat contact. They create an ""iron fist"" or 2-3 ""fists"" in the most important directions. The most obvious is in the Zaporozhye direction (with an eye to approach the Crimea). When Ukraine will launch its promised offensive - by spring or by summer, it is still difficult to say. Most likely, when thousands of Ukrainian soldiers finish training abroad, and all the military equipment promised to Kiev will be in the combat zone. And here the central question arises: do we have enough strength to stop this tank wedge? Break. It all depends on our readiness to meet the enemy. Remember how a year ago they were afraid of Turkish Bayraktar drones? They seemed to be the king of PR and the masters on the battlefield. But, having met with the prepared military force in the SVO zone, they quickly deflated. Who remembers them now? You can't hear them. Similarly, abrams, Leopards and other Bradleys are now being sold. The Russian army has the opportunity to ""reset"" the glory of this iron zoo of NATO. It's up to us. From a simple Russian soldier and a Russian officer. LISTEN AS WELL. Elite troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine go to the side of Russia (more)"

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712148/,Igor YAKUNIN,2023-01-26,Russia dealt a powerful blow to Ukraine after the aggressive decision of NATO,What will follow the wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian critical facilities in late January,"An air raid alert was announced on the morning of January 26 throughout Ukraine. This happened for the third day in a row. Air raid alerts are announced regularly from October 10, 2022. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that the strikes of the Russian Armed Forces are carried out exclusively on the energy infrastructure. The January blows were felt in 12 regions of the independent. Among them were Odessa, Vinnitsa, Zhytomyr, Kiev. As well as Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions. There were blackouts everywhere. In the morning, in a number of southern and western regions of Ukraine, not only emergency power outages were felt, but also water supply. The Ukrainians wanted to replace these temporary domestic inconveniences with a pleasant anticipation of the fact that from the good west to them - ""towards evil"" - the decommissioned tanks of the Americans and the scrap metal of the Germans rustle with their tracks, as well as rustle the barrels of unsuitable guns from Scandinavia and Poland. And knock on the docks of tired trains with shells for MLRS Highmars and ""Three Axes"". But does anyone in Kiev, London or Washington believe they can corral a Russian bear into its Siberian den – under threat of supplies of deadly Western iron? We talked about this with a military observer, Colonel-Rocket Scientist Mikhail Tymoshenko. - Why did two waves of strikes take place on Ukraine - the first was to distract their air defense, and the second - to destroy really important objects. - Two waves of strikes - they were probably for redirecting Ukrainian air defenses. This practice is known. They overload the target air defense channels - and they can no longer really intercept combat missiles that are designed to destroy critical nodes. - Then the question is what important things struck me. - Apparently, water and electricity supply facilities. We don't know what exactly or what specific objects are involved. Sewerage and water supply are also critical facilities. - So why two waves. - When it comes to two waves of blows, it is not necessary that the first is distracting, and the second is striking. And we don't know exactly what they beat? If the carriers of the bomb are long-range aircraft - from the Tu-22M3, then complexes of X-22 anti-ship missiles were made for them. There, the head weighs almost a ton. And the destruction from its fall is very great. It can be assumed that the X-22 was used. They produced almost a thousand pieces. Launched only from aircraft carriers. - In Kiev, they always say that they are massively shooting down Russian missiles with the forces of their own, Ukrainian air defenses. And now it may be that our strike and counter-statements are related to the supply of tanks to Ukraine. - They hysterically declare - and we, I think, calmly now showed our ""animal grin"" here. If this missile strike was planned before the decision to supply tanks to Ukraine was made, then this is all the more indicative. There is no need to throw around phrases behind which there is no real military force. Hit, left without light and water - then think for yourself ... LISTEN AS WELL.

Our marines with volunteer attack aircraft under the cover of aviation took the route leading from Pokrovsky to Ugledar, where they entrenched themselves on the outskirts. With the circumcision of the supply routes, Artemovsk was actually surrounded, where tens of thousands of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Polish mercenaries could be in the bag at any time. If we turn the intersection of transport arteries to maps, it seems that Kramatorsk and Slavyansk are waiting for a similar prospect of cleaning from Ukrainian nationalists. The official representative of the Ministry of Defense Igor Konashenkov at the last briefing confirmed the large losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in these sections of the contact line: more than 20 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in the Kupyansk direction, up to 70 in the Krasno-Limansky direction, in the Donetsk direction, when the ""Southern"" group of troops occupied more favorable lines and positions, more than 40 mercenaries of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were eliminated, in the South-Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions, units of the Vostok group of troops were eliminated,  Continuing offensive operations, they killed about 60 Ukrainian servicemen in the areas of Ugledar, Pavlovka and Levadne in the Zaporozhye region. The lieutenant general noted that in Ugledar, Chervonne and Kantserivka, Zaporizhia region, two fuel depots for military equipment were destroyed. In other areas, our soldiers burned a lot of Ukrainian artillery and foreign airspace tracking stations during the day, namely: two MLRS ""Grad"" installations, a self-propelled artillery installation made by the United States M109 ""Paladin"", 5 howitzers D-20 and ""Hyacinth-B"", a self-propelled howitzer ""Gvozdika"", three radar stations of counter-battery warfare produced by the United States AN / TPQ-37 and AN / TPQ-50, a radar station of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system,  and 7 more warehouses of artillery ammunition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Also, with aviation, missile troops and artillery, the grouping of troops (forces) of the Armed Forces of Russia, during the day hit 83 artillery units in firing positions, manpower and military equipment in 119 districts.

In the Kherson direction near the village of Dnipro, artillery fire stopped the enemy's attempt to cross to the left bank of the Dnieper. Up to a platoon of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and three boats were destroyed. They forgot that the Dnieper was historically successfully crossed not from right to left, but from left to right. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that German Leopard 2 tanks will arrive in the independent at best by the end of spring. Pistorius told the Bundestag: ""Deliveries can be completed no earlier than in three to four months."" Such terms are due to the preparation of tanks, ammunition and spare parts for the shipment and training of tank crews of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the first stage, Germany will provide the Kiev regime with 14 tanks. And Biden promised 31 Abrams tanks. To promise is not to marry. Somewhere in the Ukrainian headquarters, they swear loudly in Russian. The official representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Marta Hurtado, answering the question of whether the mission was aware of the abuse of Russian prisoners in Ukraine, noted that Kiev ""provided the human rights monitoring mission with access to Russian prisoners of war in official places of internment."" Urtada said: ""We were able to speak confidentially with the POWs and document allegations of human rights violations."" And why not simply admit: Russians in Ukrainian captivity are tortured, violating the Convention on the Rights of Prisoners of War. Igor Plekhov, the mayor of the city of Reni in the Odessa region, was detained on suspicion of land fraud and bribery and sent to Kiev. The amount of the alleged bribe was 50 thousand dollars. Earlier in the Odessa region, oleg Muratov, deputy head of the Odessa Regional Military Administration, was detained on suspicion of receiving a large bribe. For 25 thousand dollars, he promised to close the criminal case, the defendant of which was an official. Okay, the Russian soldier will come, he will restore order. Sozar Subari, a member of the Georgian parliament from the ""Power of the People"" movement, said that Kiev's constant reproaches against Tbilisi have a negative impact on bilateral relations. Commenting on the words of the chargé d'affaires of Ukraine in Georgia Andrei Kasyanov about the possible evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from Georgia during the restoration of air traffic between Moscow and Tbilisi, the Georgian MP expressed ""regret"" with ""poisonous statements by Ukrainian politicians, officials and experts."" In his opinion, attempts to start the evacuation of Ukrainians can cause a strong protest among them, since they live in the country in conditions better than in Europe. There are at least 25,000 Ukrainian refugees in Georgia, the state helps them, conflicts between Ukrainians and Russians in Georgia have not been noted. Barbecue is eaten, wine is drunk, weapons are not taken – it's a shame, yes. The sixth president of Ukraine signed a law that toughens the responsibility of the Ukrainian military for non-compliance with orders. Zelensky in a video message said that personnel reshuffles will continue in Ukraine, and ""any internal problems that interfere with the state will be removed."" According to him, this should contribute to rapprochement with European institutions. In addition, he said that he had put into effect another decision of the National Security and Defense Council, but did not specify which one. Well, just a knight of the cloak and dagger. The European Commission wants to reconsider the liberalization of trade with the independent. The current arrangements are hurting European farmers. EU members complain that because of Ukrainian goods, farmers in the Old World are at a disadvantage. European media reported that the EC ""is considering revising the special suspension of all tariffs and quotas for Ukrainian agri-food exports."" The temporary liberalization regime was established a year ago - until June 2023. And a number of goods from Ukraine are subject to zero customs rates. The system of input prices and tariff quotas was also suspended. But the sweat-soaked shirt of a French and German farmer was closer to the body of the European Union. A tomato from Naples - tastier than Zhytomyr. Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, suggested that the huge number of crows over Kiev could be caused by the Satanic measures of the Kiev regime against Orthodox churches and priests. Well, the former chief sanitary doctor of Russia Gennady Onishchenko proposed to take a closer look at the general sanitary and epidemiological situation in the Ukrainian capital. Simply put, they made a mess of the city. And dichlophos with domestos is unlikely to help. Adviser to the Director General of Rosenergoatom Renat Karchaa, commenting on reports about the storage of ammunition at Ukrainian nuclear power plants, suggested that IAEA inspectors ""will not find anything"" due to financial dependence on the United States. And he explained that the United States is one of the key sponsors of the UN, and the IAEA is a UN institution. According to Karchaa, ""these people are also politically engaged, they are controlled."" He stressed that ""there is no reason not to trust"" the information of the SVR about the deployment of ammunition by Ukraine at its nuclear power plants. But we remember that the atom is peaceful. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said that ""no one has solutions"" to the conflict in the independent, except for the Pope. The former prime minister said: ""I am saddened by the fact that no one but the Pope and the Holy See seems to have solutions leading to a peaceful settlement of the conflict."" According to Berlusconi, as long as the conflict in Ukraine continues, the world ""pays an unbearable price"" and suffers huge economic damage. The pontiff said his calls for peace in Ukraine were ""not being heeded"", but he would not stop condemning the fighting. Well, what's the secret here. The New York Times reported that the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny received a million inheritance from a relative in the States. According to the publication, Zaluzhny received a multimillion-dollar inheritance from an American of Ukrainian origin Gregory Stepanets, who in the ninth decade departed to another world.

The French edition of Le Grand Soir published the material ""Medical Horrors in Ukraine"", where it analyzes the information that the Ukrainian military are becoming not only guinea pigs for medical experiments of Western scientists, but also organ donors. ""Russian media indicate that some wounded Ukrainian soldiers, who are being transported for treatment to European hospitals, are being tested with new drugs. At the same time, with the seriously wounded, everything is even worse: in a field front-line hospital, a person who received a fatal wound and is ready for organ transplantation costs several hundred dollars ... Some representatives of Kiev ignored these accusations, some were quick to call them Russian propaganda. But not everything is so simple!"" - the publication believes. Le Grand Soir journalist Batko Milačić believes that ""some circumstantial evidence was provided by the Ukrainians themselves."" And not only Ukrainians. For example, after Russia released data on American laboratories in Ukraine and experiments on local residents, the United States admitted: yes, there is such a thing. But they made a reservation that everything corresponded to security conditions. And now for the fun part. ""Even before the start of hostilities, on December 16, 2021 (that is, more than two months before the SVO, - Author), the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that allows the removal of organs from the dead without the notarized consent of the deceased themselves or their official representatives,"" the publication states. And the term ""official representative"" in this case is spelled out very vaguely. For example, this may be an outsider who is responsible for the burial of a citizen of Ukraine. Accordingly, in wartime, the status of an official representative may be assigned to the commander of the unit. In short, after such facts, even European journalists have the impression that Ukraine was really preparing for war. And it was as if I was even thinking in advance about what I could make money on here. ""In fact, an experienced surgeon can perform a human kidney transplant in 15 minutes. This can be done even in the field of a front-line hospital. At the same time, donor glasses are very much in demand in the medical market of the United States and Europe. "" The French are wondering: how many such operations could have been carried out on the Ukrainian side in the past year since the beginning of the SVO? And they recall the infamous lists of missing Ukrainian soldiers. Recall, on December 14, 2022, hackers from the Anarchist Kombatant group announced that they had hacked the official archive of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And they found there a report on the missing soldiers of the independent country. There are 35,382 people in this list - more than 2,000 printed sheets of full names, military ranks, personal numbers and so on. The author of Le Grand Soir wonders whether this is not too much for the army, whose generals claim to confidently hold the front. And where did those 35,000 people really go? Killed? Taken prisoner? But in this case, the number of real Ukrainian prisoners could be made public by the Red Cross. In short, the French have more and more questions to Ukraine, the methodology of their calculations and incompleteness. ""We can assume that in fact these more than 35 thousand people were buried somewhere, cremated or simply abandoned on the battlefields. These are ideal conditions for the work of black transplantologists. Russian human rights activists are confident that surgeons are extracting suitable organs from wounded but still living soldiers with the permission of the Ukrainian command."" The French edition reflects on the fact that during the previous major wars, significant breakthroughs in medicine were made. So, after the First World War, doctors learned how to more effectively treat poisoning and do plastic surgery. After the Second World War, antibiotics began to be used en masse. And the Russian SVO in Ukraine, it seems, will be used by Western scientists as a testing ground for new developments. As you know, wounded Ukrainian soldiers are taken from the front and for treatment to hospitals in the European Union. For example, in the hospital of the German city of Aachen. ""Hundreds of Ukrainians receive experimental drugs - the soldiers themselves say this. But is it ethical to test such drugs, procedures and treatment algorithms on them?"" asks Le Grand Soir. The article emphasizes that we are talking about drugs that have not been certified and are in development. That is, in its pure form, an experiment on living people. And Germany, it seems, is becoming a new testing ground - is it not there, they say, that those same American laboratories will move from the warring Ukraine. The journalist of the publication argues that Europe can evaluate such a rich material for experiments and the flow of donor organs as some kind of medical ""bonuses"" for its economy affected by anti-Russian sanctions. That is, thanks to the unfortunate Ukrainian wounded, ""European medicine will receive a significant impetus for its development."" ""Organs taken from dead Ukrainians will save the lives of many thousands of Europeans and Americans. But isn't it immoral to use war to advance medical science and the health care system? Every European must answer this question for himself. To begin with, remembering Mengele, Eichmann and other ""doctors"" of the Third Reich. """

And for us, the fact of sending the Abrams may be the most unpleasant. -Why. - It's not about the reasoning that the Americans will allegedly supply heavy armored vehicles in penny quantities. In fact, they will transfer a lot at once. It is important that along with this, the necessary repair and evacuation equipment will be immediately transferred. And, of course, complete sets of spare parts. And I would look at this threat more closely than I would look at the Leopards. - So within a year or a year, deliveries are still different things. - About the fact that in a year - they say out loud today. And they said about the Patriot air defense system that Kiev would never have them, then they said that they would not be soon - and now Ukrainians are being trained to work on these anti-aircraft missile systems, and in Ukraine these systems are expected from day to day. It's a similar story with tanks – they will certainly be delivered. However, there is one ""but"". -What. - The final decision on the timing and number of vehicles will be made based on the situation on the battlefield in the coming weeks, a maximum of a month and a half. If the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the SVO zone find themselves in a situation close to capitulation, then no Abrams will be supplied to Kiev. If Kiev somehow manages to withstand Russian pressure until spring, then American tanks may end up in Ukraine in a short time, for example, in March-April. - And nato countries have enough leopard stocks for serious tank deliveries to Kiev. - There is a nuance here. ""Leopards"" are supplied not from german factories, but actually from combat units. The peak of their mass production has passed a long time ago. Yes, they are still produced - but in rather limited quantities. Their latest modifications are very expensive. And they produce cars, mainly for export. Ukraine will be given early, old modifications. Their reserves are quite large - more than a thousand in Europe. And Berlin no longer forbids other countries to transfer them to Kiev. But the question arises – what to replace? And will it be possible to do it in a short time? The answer to the second question is no. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4710953/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-24,"They stole billions, their heads flew: What mass resignations really mean in Zelensky's entourage","Instead of putting Ukrainian corrupt officials around him, Zelensky let them go in peace and millions to resign.","This week has not started easily for Zelensky's team. A whole series of resignations, more like an epidemic of a deadly virus, snatched several prominent figures from the ranks of his team at once. The first in importance was the Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak Kirill Tymoshenko. This figure had to be sacrificed in order to clear the ranks of the team from ""suspicions of corruption."" Of course, it sounds ridiculous about the person who oversaw the ""Big Construction"" program, which in Ukraine was aptly called ""Big Theft"", who stole (of course, not alone) at least 50 billion hryvnias from the road construction and repair program, who put his hands in the humanitarian aid for several tens of millions of dollars in his pocket in a warring country. And after all that, of which everyone in Ukraine is well aware, he wrote a letter of resignation of his own free will, signing it: ""I have honor!"" Although the day before he was going to ""fight"". Numerous scandals with the appropriation of humanitarian aid and its resale through commercial stores by real organized crime groups, formed with the participation of people close to Tymoshenko, which sounded for more than one month, also clearly played a role in this story. But the same ""expropriations"" were made in favor of Yermak. These were two competing teams in the struggle for financial flows under the command of Yermak and Tymoshenko. Both were Zelensky's ""people"", but they stole independently of each other, not forgetting about generous contributions to the patron. The deputy minister of defense of Ukraine Vyacheslav Shapovalov also became a victim of a corruption scandal. After the scandal with the supply of food to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at two or three times inflated prices, the chair was quite noticeably shaken under the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov himself, but he, according to informed sources, was saved by the same all-powerful Yermak, Zelensky's right hand. Although more and more it seems that he is also the brains of the Ukrainian president – such a completely non-public figure, a gray cardinal of the Ukrainian throne. Or hetmanates, if you follow historical traditions. Strictly speaking, the famous Ukrainian traitor to the Russian Tsar Mazepa also worked most of his life as a clerk under the hetman. Who else has flown off their incubated and warm places? Ivan Lukerya – Deputy Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine, his colleague in the same ministry, another Deputy Minister Vyacheslav Negoda, Deputy Minister of Social Policy Vitaliy Muzychenko. One could, of course, quietly and sarcastically giggle at the corner, saying, why does the country need deputy ministers for something that does not exist in the country. If the whole social policy is reduced to the distribution of funding received from the West, and the entire infrastructure turns into dust and dust, not without the participation of our Russian troops. But in this case, it would be more logical to dismiss ministers immediately, and not to be limited to their deputies. By the way, if the West had bet on the distribution of allocated finances by items of expenditure in the ""Social Policy"" section, then Ukrainians would clearly have received more, because in the process they would simply steal less of this money. No, the beauty of the situation with the queue of resignations of high-ranking defendants is that they were faced with a choice: resignation or acquaintance with criminal cases, the SBU and prison terms after the trials. Oaths of personal loyalty to Yermak are not needed from them, he has his own people already prepared for these posts. And the ""proofs"" for each of them are more than enough not for one term, but for several criminal cases at once. But arresting them is fraught – they sat high, they know a lot, it is better to let them quietly clean up where they want. Five current heads of regions also lost their posts. Dnipropetrovsk, Kiev, Sumy, as well as those controlled by the independent part of Zaporozhye and Kherson regions were beheaded. And of these five, only the former head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration Oleksiy Kuleba (do not be afraid, this is not the foreign minister, but another Kuleba) can record his current resignation as an asset, because, according to rumors, he is expected to replace the dismissed Tymoshenko, to the post of Yermak's deputy. And the choice of these, let's call them governors, persons also indicates that Yermak, together with Zelensky, is cleaning up the ""glade"" for themselves. with the exception of Kuleba, these governors showed some dissatisfaction with the work of Kiev, allowed themselves a slight fronde led by the mayor of Kiev Vitaly ""Zlatoust"" Klitschko, including about the financing of ""points of non-malice"" to heat the population, but, most importantly, were very important links in tymoshenko's ""enrichment"" machine. Now it is time to get ready for the mayor of Dnepropetrovsk Boris Filatov, who inadvertently formed, together with the Ukrainian-born congresswoman Republican Victoria Spartz, an alliance directed against Yermak. The only thing that can save Boris ""aveshatmyhbudempot"" Filatov is the difficulty of replacing him with an equivalent figure. Zelensky did not imprison any of the corrupt officials from his entourage, although he promised imprisonment when he was elected to the presidency (and what he did not promise there, as in a vulgar anecdote), he simply sent the most prominent and odious figures to resign along with the millions and billions they stole. And, moreover, having previously cleared the information field from any opposition, now he has concentrated all financial flows in one hand. And these are the hands of his, excuse me, right hand – Andrei Yermak. Except for the illegal arms trade by the functionaries of the Armed Forces of Ukraine appointed to this responsible area. But this is the fiefdom of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny. At least not yet. Or until he is replaced by a more trusted general in Zelensky's eyes. Actually, this is the essence of resignations and career perturbations in the cubicle of Zelensky's team, where those who are weaker are chewed without any regret by the strongest. Well, along the way, Zelensky also reported to Washington on how he uncompromisingly and without feeling sorry for himself fights corruption. LISTEN AS WELL.

According to him, the symbiosis of growing corruption and megalomania is to blame for everything. Which Kiev ""masked"" with a fairy tale about the big game of Ukraine with the United States, Europe, Russia and China. ""In 1991, Ukraine was a more developed country than Poland,"" Sikorsky recalled. - Kiev got a territory with built nuclear units, the aviation industry, with the most fertile lands in the world and without debts. However, by the time the special operation began in 2022, Ukraine's GDP was already four times less than that of Poland. The former foreign minister of Poland, in general, is distinguished by sharpness in his statements, despite the authorities. In 2014, when he was the head of the Foreign Ministry, he, however, in a private conversation, which was recorded without his consent, honestly admitted: ""This is shit, we will quarrel with the Germans and the French ... Poland's problem is that we have cheap national pride and low self-esteem..."" And the truth, as you know, is not loved everywhere. For which Sikorsky paid with his post. But he didn't stop telling the truth. As it turned out, since the beginning of the Special Military Operation of Russia on the territory of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, out of about 700 (plus or minus) parishes of the canonical Orthodox denomination of the UOC, not a single one has moved to the schismatic pro-government OCU / UCU, which was organized by ex-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko together with Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople at that time. - In the spring of last year, the head of the Transcarpathian diocese of the OCU, Bishop Varsonofy, stated that since the beginning of the full-scale conflict, not a single parish of the UOC-MP in Transcarpathia has passed to the OCU. Unfortunately, since the spring, nothing has changed much, - complained archpriest Serhiy Yemets, secretary of the Transcarpathian diocese of the OCU, chaplain of the Chop border detachment. - People seem to want to cross, many turn to us, call both priests and the bishop, but there are practically no transitions themselves. The priests and the church itself block them so that the parishes do not pass. Young people often answer that my grandmother went to this church, my parents go, and I will, and I don't care what kind of church it is. In addition, propaganda on their part works very powerfully. That's why it's all so complicated. They would not anger the Lord. Ukrainian-Hungarian relations are reaching a boiling point. Military enlistment offices staged a real hunt for conscripts from among ethnic Hungarians in the settlements of the region, and they hid in their homes. Many of them, as the journalists of the Index edition managed to find out, are hiding in their homes. Moreover, not in living rooms, but in basements, or, more often, in attics under the roof. Not leaving there for literally weeks. Ukrainian military commissars and teams that recruit mobilized do not enjoy any trust among the local population. Moreover, the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is traditionally staffed by the local population, including the Hungarian one, was recently defeated, but the relatives of the mobilized are still not informed of any information about the fate of their family members. Ukraine's claims have long gone beyond the ""wishes"" of political preferences or the supply of military equipment. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine may also boycott the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024, if the IOC, as announced, allows Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete even under a neutral flag. This was announced by the Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine and President of the National Olympic Committee Vadym Gutzeit. ""Our position is unchanged: as long as the conflict continues in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be at international competitions,"" the bombastic Ukrainian official said. It remains only to find out where his and Kiev's integrity was during the US invasion of Iraq, the bombing of Yugoslavia, etc. By the way, so as not to forget - at the last Olympics, the Ukrainian team took 44th place among all participants in the sets of awards. If there is no Russia and Belarus, then there is a chance to rise in this unofficial standings. At least until '42. The collection of signatures in Italy against the speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky at the Sanremo Music Festival has turned into a real social movement. Moreover, the ex-comedian planned to perform not as a singer, or even as a musical performer (for example, on the piano), but with a speech - an appeal to the Italian people. The initiative caused a powerful public protest, since Zelensky was already fed up, and the Network quickly organized a petition demanding that the organizers not give Zelensky the opportunity to speak. Currently, a petition with such a demand has already been signed by more than 32 thousand people, and the number of signatories continues to grow. Many ""weighty characters"" are also in favor of depriving Zelensky of his word. ""If I have ten minutes for the festival, I will watch the songs, not Zelensky,"" Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said. And it can be understood. For many Italians with a musical ear, listening to fake notes performed by Zelensky is still a test for nerves. - The President of Brazil refused to supply Germany with ammunition for Leopard tanks so that they would not fall on Ukraine. - The government of Ukraine is one of the worst in the world. Corrupt and controlled by a few rich people. I feel very sorry for the Ukrainians,"" multi-billionaire Bill Gates suddenly said sensationally. I guess I ate something. - The Swedish Foreign Minister, after a series of actions with the burning of the Koran, said that Sweden of the regiment suspends the process of joining NATO, but there is a chance to negotiate with Turkey in July. - Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor said that his state provides much more assistance to Ukraine than he says, just most of this assistance remains in the shadows and behind the scenes. The ambassador probably understands that this is a case where ""modesty decorates"" and helps to avoid some consequences. But thanks for talking. - The Government of Ukraine intends to return to raising tariffs for utilities after the end of the heating season. - Ex-President of Georgia and former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his return to Georgia in a container with sour cream and other yogurts was organized by ...

Zelensky is less and less fascinated and, on the contrary, more and more frank statements paint an extremely unflattering picture for the president of (so far) Ukraine. For example, it is not the first time that the well-known Ukrainian economist Oleg Soskin has been critical of Zelensky. And this time, he, in general, accused Zelensky that he unleashed the conflict and fights ""to the last Ukrainian"" because of his own personal ambitions. This, according to Soskin, is no longer about the reputation of Zelensky (I found a word), but about the lives of tens and hundreds of millions of people. - Zelensky said that he had nothing to talk about with Putin at all and nothing to talk about. And Peskov has already stated that Zelensky has long ceased to be an opponent, a negotiator for Putin, - Soskin outlined the situation and imagined what unpleasant prospects Ukrainians can expect in the future. - There is a huge dossier on Zelensky in Moscow, there are recorded all his performances in different private clubs in front of different persons, how much he was paid, in what form he performed there, what he said. Putin, Patrushev – have all the video files on Zelensky and all the payments, and on Zelensky's wife. Naturally, they all relaxed as best they could, being paid individuals, a bohemian party. Now this is serious kompromat, the only question is when it will be thrown out. - When many files, speeches, speeches of Zelensky in different forms are published, I am afraid that for many of us playing the piano with a (Zlensky's famous number as part of Kvartal-95. - Ed.) will seem like a child's toy, compared to what Moscow apparently has today - except that Soskin did not grab his head. - And then, of course, a powerful international scandal will begin. - But what do the citizens of Ukraine have to do with this? – the political scientist-economist was surprised. - I believe that the situation for Ukraine is definitely becoming disastrous, because Zelensky believes that he can throw hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to their deaths. A new phase of the conflict begins, and from Zelensky's statements it turns out that with the support of the West to the last Ukrainian. No, the motives and the scenario of Zelensky's actions are described quite correctly. Especially if we recall the psychological portrait of the current Ukrainian president, very correctly drawn back in 2020 by Oleksiy Arestovich: ""Zelensky is a weak man, he has two keys: petty pride and fear."" But Mr. Soskin swims shallowly, reducing everything to a supposedly bilateral interpersonal conflict. It is beneficial for Kiev to equate Zelensky with Putin, putting them on the same board. Although Zelensky could stand next to Putin only in his wildest dreams. But in one thing Soskin is right unconditionally and absolutely: the conflict to the last Ukrainian is a conscious choice of Zelensky himself. Only one factor is unclear what is behind Soskin's courage - the madness of the brave, or he has some powerful defense that does not allow him to be touched. Since in Ukraine people now fly to the ""basements of the SBU"" for much smaller ""transgressions"". LISTEN AS WELL. Futurologist told what to expect in Russia in 2023 (more)"

Dorenko died in May 2019, and his words remain relevant to this day. ""Ukraine for the time being will be just an explosive mechanism for the redivision of Europe,"" Dorenko said, predicting a conflict against the EU and Russia. These processes were observed already in 2015, according to him, Russia along with the preservation of relations will have to ""restore order"" in Ukraine, however, not in those years. Then he said that the next ten years will turn into difficult trials for Russia: ""we will be bent, broken, very seriously,"" while he noted that Russia has only one way - to survive.

He said these words on camera back in 2015. And now this video is already considered by many to be prophetic. The task of Russia is not only to survive, but also to come out stronger, the journalist believed. He was convinced that the Russian people would do it. - I don't know how we'll do it, but we'll do it. Otherwise, we will fall apart to the mother, and no one will remember our existence,"" Dorenko said at the time. Nevertheless, the conflict in Ukraine, he argued, will not be limited to everything. According to him, ""provocations"" will continue in Belarus, then in the Baltics, and then in the Black Sea. ""Provocations will continue all the time. Always. Because we cannot allow the unification of Europe and Russia,"" Dorenko suggested. The main reason for this, in his opinion, is the attempts of the United States and the ""Anglo-Saxons"" in general to prevent the unification of Russia and Germany into a single Eurasian Economic Union, because then they ""will have nothing left."" ""The Anglo-Saxons and, in particular, America cannot allow German-Russian Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok. You can go to the map and see, can you understand that?

One HARM anti-radar missile was also destroyed. The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov acknowledged the difficult situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the east. He spoke of a difficult but ostensibly controlled environment. An air raid alert was announced in the Odessa, Mykolaiv, Kirovograd regions of Ukraine and the Kiev-controlled part of the Kherson region, this was indicated by the data of the online map of the Ministry of Digitalization. Four people were killed as a result of the shelling of the bridge near Melitopol by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, five more people were injured. In the DPR, reconnaissance aircraft destroyed the American M113 armored personnel carrier and Ukrainian militants with a missile strike. The identified targets were hit by ATGMs. Rogov said that the Russian army took control of nine settlements in Zaporozhye. In Artemovsk, the Russian military discovered the bodies of foreign mercenaries mutilated by the enemy with their heads cut off."
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712862/,Alexander KOTS,2023-01-28,"Russia's New Tactics, Serious Reinforcement of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Truth About the Battles on the Frontline: Answers to Uncomfortable Questions About the Special Operation","Voenkor Alexander Kots spoke about the new tactics of Russia, which broke through the gap in the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine","YouGov, a research center close to the British government, published a survey ""How do you feel about the fact that the UK could supply Ukraine with fighter jets?"". Such a probing of public opinion. And, judging by the answers, the majority of residents of Foggy Albion do not see anything wrong with these deliveries: Quarters of the population generally on the drum, 50 percent either support the transfer of aircraft to Kiev, or do not object. We've been following the dramatic play ""about the difficult relationship between the U.S. and Germany"" for the past week. They depicted the battle of the Titans: ""You first, go the tanks!"" - ""No, you!"". In fact, this is a homemade blank, played for a large audience. Everything was a foregone conclusion. And all these deliveries are formed under the plan of attack in the spring-summer Ukrainian campaign. It is compiled, of course, not in Kiev. In my opinion, in the line of deliveries of Western equipment to Ukraine, it is not the tanks that should be more alarming, but the number of artillery. It's a whole artillery corps - three brigades. - Paladin self-propelled guns are an excellent weapon. - Archer is a little worse, but also serious. - AS-30, Caesar, which has already established itself in combat. Tanks probably add spice to all these deliveries. What is known at this point? Absolutely. - The United States will deliver 31 Abrams to Ukraine. - Germany promises 14 Leopards. - United Kingdom – 14 Challenger 2. - Poland says it wants to deliver 14 Leopards. Plus it is going to, but has not yet decided when to send, Portugal - 4 pieces, the Netherlands some quantity, Norway - up to 8, Finland, Denmark. It was announced that the first batch of ""Leopards"" will come to Ukraine in 3 months. But most likely, these terms will be shortened. Such an international that is going to clench a tank fist in the area of the line of contact. Let's proceed from the fact that we knocked out all the Soviet equipment from Ukraine. She is starving. We solve these problems at the expense of our military industry. And Kiev does not have such an opportunity, so they are forced to switch to the ""donations"" of the west. But dependence on the NATO manufacturer may at some point prove fatal. Nevertheless, the scale of supplies cannot but strain. What to do with them. The simplest answer is to hit even behind enemy lines before they cross the Dnieper, and cut the bridges connecting the two banks. But, as the last 11 months have shown, the enemy does not have much logistical problems as a result of our strikes. And all deliveries of recent times are more or less secretively by civilian transport, trucks. What needs to be done to bring down these bridges? This can be done, for example, by strategic aviation. What needs to be done to make strategic aviation work on Ukraine? It is necessary to suppress air defense systems. But we need to calculate the option that they will still reach the line of contact. And how we will meet them there is also very important. In the Persian Gulf during the 1990-1991 war, 23 Abrams were destroyed. During the first two years of the Iraq War of 2003-2011, more than 100 vehicles were put out of action. The Houthis destroyed about 45 Abrams from the Saudis. The Abrams are not some kind of wunderwaffe that will provide Ukraine with bloodless progress through the territories controlled by the Russian army. But these supplies cannot be treated condescendingly either. These are serious, high-tech weapons. Sooner or later we will have to face them. As with a huge amount of new artillery. And this means that we need to improve the counter-battery struggle in two months. This, of course, is a difficult task. It is impossible to transfer already trained artillerymen and anti-tank battalions to the infantry. After all, they will have to burn American, British, German and other equipment in 2-3 months. And we will simply have nowhere to take them. We have now imposed our initiative on the enemy. We have several points where he feels quite uncomfortable. Firstly, it is Zaporozhye. There are now interesting events in the Orekhov area. The enemy is forced to transfer reserves there, including, by the way, from the Donetsk direction. And at this time, taking advantage of this, there is an offensive in the south-Donetsk direction - Ugledar. We have already clung to the first houses, cutting almost all the roads of its supply. Of the relatively safe ones, only one remained - the route to Kurakhovo. But it is also under the fire control of our gunners, because we control most of Marinka and from there we see supply routes. An operation is underway to capture Artemovsk, the largest node of the enemy's defense. To the north of it there is fighting in the direction of Seversk. Ukrainian troops do not have the ability to concentrate large forces in any one direction. They are forced to send ""fire brigades"" back and forth. This is probably the same blank under which the castling was carried out in the command of a special military operation. I think that the preparatory measures were carried out by the former commander Sergei Surovikin, after which he handed over the reins of power to the Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov, who is now responsible for everything - both successes and defeats, if any. But, perhaps, this is the very expansion of the format of the special operation, along with the supply of tanks, which the Ministry of Defense told us about when it explained the reshuffle in the command. Yes, in the course of this conflict, problems in our military machine have also been revealed. But it's good that we've learned about them now. Someone says that ""probably the Commander-in-Chief doesn't have the whole picture."" There is, and I know it for sure. People who are not young, but who live a long time in our country, know perfectly well that it is useless to expect sharp personnel decisions from Vladimir Vladimirovich. And in general, the expected decisions. Someone might and would like flying heads and ripped off shoulder straps. But that's not our president's style. We have a list of what is missing. Understanding where you need what is needed is the same. We need to see how the industry and the leadership of the Defence Ministry will cope with this."

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712695/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2023-01-27,West in hysterics: Russian frigate with irresistible Zircon missiles entered the Waters of the Atlantic,"Hypersonic missile ""Zircon"" will be adopted by the Russian Navy","The surface-based Zircon hypersonic cruise missile will be adopted by the Russian Navy this year. This was reported to journalists by the General Director and General Designer of the Reutov NPO of Mechanical Engineering Alexander Leonov. This issue is already at the stage of purely organizational work - the missiles are already being mass-produced. For example, the frigate ""Admiral Gorshkov"" has already received its ammunition. This message may puzzle someone. After all, the frigate ""Admiral Gorshkov"" with ""Zircons"" on board immediately after the New Year went into combat service. He had already passed the English Channel and even conducted an exercise to hit a target in the Atlantic. In the West, our Zircons are already fully afraid, and for some reason we are only announcing the adoption into service. The fact is that the first ship for which the Zircons will become a standard weapon will not be the Admiral Gorshkov, but another frigate of the same project - the Admiral Golovko, it is still undergoing factory tests. And on the Gorshkov, hypersonic missiles were installed in converted silos from under the Kalibr. But the frigate had already conducted several tests, fired from the Barents Sea into the White Sea, sank the conditional ships of the enemy, which were located for 1000 and even more kilometers ... In general, our latest hypersonic weapons have already shown themselves in the most favorable light at sea. So the current long-distance campaign of the Admiral Gorshkov can be considered presentational. The ship will pass throughout the Atlantic Ocean, cross the Indian Ocean and enter the Mediterranean Sea. Throughout the journey, maneuvers are planned, including with the use of Zircons. It is curious that maneuvers are planned with the participation of ships of the Navy of other friendly countries. When the Admiral Gorshkov went to sea and approached the shores of the former Western partners, they almost had a tantrum. ""Arming the ships of the Russian Navy with hypersonic Zircons can lead to a breakthrough in the naval defense of the North Atlantic Alliance!"", - wrote the English Express. What is so frightening about the West? Yes, at least the fact that ""Zircon"" is a real storm of the seas, its range and speed is amazing. The West cannot defend itself against it today. Remember the Giparsonic Missile Dagger? One such in Ukraine pierced a Soviet underground bunker designed to hit an atomic bomb. So, ""Zircon"" is its marine counterpart. The rocket rushes at a speed of Mach 9, that is, 9 times faster than the speed of sound, and at the same time still maneuvers. No air defense or missile defense system , neither existing nor promising – is able to keep track of such a target, much less catch up with it and intercept it. Zircons carry 400 kilograms of explosives – enough to cause life-threatening damage to any aircraft carrier. At the same time, 1000 kilometers of range is not the limit, some sources talk about 1.5 thousand kilometers as the maximum range of destruction. The rocket passes through the marching section at an altitude of 30-40 kilometers, where the air is thin and practically does not resist. This can significantly increase the range and speed of the missile and facilitates anti-missile maneuvers. Such characteristics allow our even small ships to feel superior when meeting with an entire enemy aircraft carrier group. It's like with Kalashnikov to reach ten ""pitchers"" who have only fists. Well, who will run first. The West understands this very well. Here is what the American edition of Military Watch Magazine writes about the characteristics of the Zircon missile. - Among the most valuable characteristics of the Zircon is its extreme speed, which, combined with high maneuverability and small radar cross-section, makes it almost impossible to reliably protect against this missile by existing air defense systems. The Zircon will help make up for the Russian Navy's lack of a large surface fleet and allow for relatively smaller ships, such as the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates and even smaller corvette-sized ships could pose a very serious threat to fleets consisting of much larger destroyers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Russian ships will be able to exploit the missile's range advantage, its uniquely high survivability against air defenses, and the enormous damage that the pure kinetic energy of its strikes can cause. So with Zircon, we're just getting started. The most interesting is ahead. The general director of the plant in Reutov spoke about the surface missile. However, the same is on the way for submarines. Underwater ""Zircons"" also successfully passed the tests. Launches from the underwater and surface position were made by the Submarine ""Severodvinsk"". And the first regular carrier of the new missiles will be the perm multi-purpose submarine. LISTEN AS WELL. Elite troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine go to the side of Russia (more)"

""Chief of Staff Warrant Officer Ainur Iskanyarov during a special military operation ensured uninterrupted, stable communication and exchange of information within the battalion tactical group of the Russian Armed Forces.

Realizing that the lack of communication would deprive the command of the ability to quickly coordinate the actions of forces in battle, realizing that he was in mortal danger, Iskanyarov moved to the damaged product and began to restore it. While under fire from militants, Ainur assessed the nature of the damage and promptly replaced the damaged elements, after which he reconfigured the station.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712836/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-27,The real reason for the U.S. interest in the conflict in Ukraine. Deception is astounding,"In Ukraine, no one asked a single question about the cost of the tanks promised by Washington. Because arithmetic is a Moskal pseudoscience","I'll tell you one clever thing – just don't be offended. It is not for nothing that the Americans put at one time the head of Ukrainian medicine ""Dr. Death"" Ulyana Suprun, who did not even have a full-fledged diploma. And it is not for nothing that even during the presidency of Poroshenko, they dictated the reform of school education, emphasizing that mathematics and even arithmetic is a ""Moskal"" pseudoscience, the hammering of which the heads of the younger generation is a completely unnecessary thing for this generation. And here is the first evidence of their correctness. US President Joseph Biden announced that the United States will provide Kiev with a batch of 31 main battle tanks of the US Army M1 Abrams for a total of $ 400 million. By simple arithmetic operations, even one of them, called division, we get that the cost of one M1 Abrams tank for Kiev will thus be 12 million 903 thousand US dollars. It's a terrific figure. Just like a modern combat jet fighter. And this is despite the fact that according to official data, the cost of such tanks under contracts for the US army itself is from 5 to 6 million dollars. Moreover, if the average balance price of the tank in the modification of the M1A2 was about 6.2 million dollars, then the Iraqi army such tanks were supplied at the rate of 1.4 million dollars per vehicle. Even with the option of what kind of modernization with the introduction of all new systems of protection, aiming and firing, this increased the cost of the tank, at most, by $ 2 million. And then all of a sudden, instead of 6 million, there are almost 13 million. I want Gerasimos from the anecdote about Muma to straighten up to his full height and proudly and persistently ask: ""For what?"" Especially if we consider that, as Politico wrote, Washington will supply Kiev with not the latest versions of modernized tanks. In particular, Kiev will receive tanks not with the most secret ""impenetrable"" armor, in which there is depleted uranium in the alloy, but simpler and less protected models. But it's not asked, because the answer is obvious: ""Because."" Or a completely different logic began to operate here. And the American authorities, together with the company for the production of these tanks, read at what prices the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine buys eggs for the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and decided to also break the ""luck coupon"", which falls out no more than a couple of times in a lifetime. Moreover, Kiev still has nowhere to go, it can now steam a tank at the price of a destroyer, no less. After all, with the obvious outcome for everyone in Ukraine, no one is going to pay any debts. Therefore, they will agree now to any prices and any contracts. Especially if you manage to put a little more (30 percent plus or minus) in your pocket in the form of kickbacks. Are the Abrams worse than eggs? Nothing. If Normal Mathematics and Arithmetic continued to be taught in Ukraine, such a contract could raise many questions among the population. But for those who do not know the multiplication table, everything is as good as possible. Americans really know what and why they are doing in their colonies. P.S. In such a simple way, most of the ""loaned"" billions of Western aid for Ukraine will settle in the pockets of the tycoons of the US military-industrial complex, strengthening the economy and currency. This is the real reason for all of NATO's efforts to prolong the conflict. Poorly trained ""sacrificial"" Ukrainians forge dollars for the states with their blood."

In the Donetsk direction, the Southern Group of Forces destroyed up to a company of Ukrainian servicemen, an American M109 Paladin self-propelled gun and a US-made AN/TPQ-50 radar in a day.

We'll say until it dawns on you: Claps, tick. Until recently, Boris Johnson, who headed the UK, inserted a hairpin on the Rada TV channel to a journalist from The Independent State, who compared Russians with Nazis. The former British Prime Minister advised to be careful with such analogies and not to forget that both Russians and Ukrainians suffered huge losses from the Nazi regime of Germany 80 years ago. At the same time, Johnson, of course, did not fail to express support for the ""people of Ukraine"" in their just struggle for freedom. And nothing that many of these ""fighters"" have tattoos with a reference to Nazi Germany. Donald Trump, the previous PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, is confident that he would have agreed to end the conflict in Ukraine in 24 hours. Moreover, Trump is convinced that the confrontation could have been avoided if he had remained in the White House. Donald has repeatedly said that a military clash in the East of Europe can result in a third world war. Trump, in particular, argues that after the transfer of American and German tanks to Kiev, the nuclear conflict has become real. But the ex-president did not tell any details about his secret of his quick prevention. A cunning red fox. A resident of Birmingham Andrea said that she was shocked by the attitude of a Ukrainian refugee to local residents. She hosted a Ukrainian woman and her son as part of the ""Houses for Ukraine"" program and said that she lives in an area full of representatives of different nationalities. After settling in, the Ukrainian woman said that ""there are too many Muslims in this area."" The Ukrainian woman was outraged by the fact that in the school where her child studies, the majority are black and Asian. Andrea offered the Ukrainian to look for a new house and broke the contract. Since the beginning of the SVO, almost 8 million people have fled to the countries of the Old World from the independent country. Befuddled by Western propaganda, Europeans apparently thought that the stories about Nazism and the racial hatred of guests were Russian fakes. So what's the way it is now?.. Vasyl Miroshnichenko, Ukraine's ambassador to Canberra, called on the organizers of the Australian Open to ban the father of the world's best tennis player Novak Djokovic from appearing in the stands until the end of the tournament. According to a diplomat from Ukraine, the behavior of Djokovic Sr. is a disgrace for the Australian Open, sanctions should be imposed against daddy, and his illustrious son is obliged to express his opinion about the incident. Earlier, the Australian Tennis Federation chastised Serbian Novak Djokovic and his father Srdjan - he was photographed at the Australian Open next to a fan who was wearing a T-shirt with the letter Z and with the Russian tricolor. And you Led Zeppelin will also condemn. Bloomberg reported that EU lawyers found ""legal grounds"" for the temporary use of almost 34 billion euros from the frozen assets of the Bank of Russia for the interests of Kiev. The theft plan in the interests of the Zelensky regime will be able to turn if Russian assets are not expropriated – the amount of borrowing and interest will one day still have to be returned to Moscow. The agency believes that legal grounds for the arrest of Russian property have not been found. And in Brussels, they decided to combine these assets first - to make a profit. And after that – to transfer to Ukraine. Earlier, the head of the working group of the US Department of Justice to identify and arrest Russian assets falling under US restrictions, Andrew Adams, said that Washington soon intends to begin transferring part of the confiscated assets to Russia in favor of Ukraine. The thief on the thief sits and chases the thief. Sabrina Singh, deputy spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said that the United States does not exclude the possibility of supplying Kiev with other serious weapons, except for tanks and MLRS. Speaking about the possibility of supplying the F-16, Singh stressed that this type of weapon will require pilot training and more people leaving the battlefield to learn how to handle an entirely new system. At the same time, she added that Ukrainians have demonstrated that they can learn how to handle complex systems. Oh, and a monkey can be taught to knock down a banana with a stick. But Germany continues to try to call on the Allies in good faith. German Defense Minister Pistorius said that the supply of combat aircraft to Kiev is out of the question. Le Monde reports that Paris is still not ripe for the supply of Leclerc tanks to Kiev. In French military circles, it is believed that their tanks require such significant logistical support and maintenance that Ukraine will not be able to provide. Now the army of the Fifth Republic has 226 Lerlerc tanks. Of these, only two-thirds of the machines are in operation. And if talk of transferring 100 tanks to the Kiev regime ceases to be only talk, then this can seriously weaken the defense capability of France. And they still need to return the title of world champions in football, and without tanks it is unlikely. The DPA agency reports that the first group of officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine arrived in Germany to master the Marder armored cars, Another group of Ukrainians will soon begin to learn how to work with Leopard tanks. While sweating in Cologne. But they are already waiting for specialists in anti-tank warfare near Artemovsk... Sergei Chemezov, the general director of Rostec, said that Kiev's allegations that the Russian army does not have enough shells in the SVO zone are nonsense. In an interview with RIA Novosti, Chemezov said: ""Talk that Russia is allegedly running out of shells is nonsense. By order of the Ministry of Defense, we have increased the production of ammunition several times. For some species, it has been increased by several orders of magnitude."" The head of Rostec noted that during the special operation, indeed, a large amount of ammunition of all types is consumed - cartridges, artillery and tank shells, missiles. But their supply to the troops is not decreasing. According to experts, the Tactical Missile Armament Corporation, which makes a nomenclature of missiles, Almaz-Antey, which produces anti-aircraft guided missiles, and the Techmash concern, which produces a wide range of artillery and rocket shells, are working intensively in Russia. And about the ""shortage"" ask the ""warriors of light"" in the trenches on the front line."

Also, during the infliction of a fire defeat on the enemy, Yakovlev carried out the adjustment of the artillery fire of the brigade, thanks to which the artillery positions of the nationalists were suppressed. With the dense fire of enemy tanks and aircraft along the front line of the brigade's defense line, Dmitry personally supervised the defensive actions of the units, skillfully using the terrain conditions to occupy the most advantageous positions. At night, the enemy made unsuccessful attempts to encircle the platoon stronghold of the Russian Armed Forces. Acting decisively and bravely, Lieutenant Colonel Yakovlev, despite the threat to his life, personally organized a fire defeat, preventing the enemy from entering the flank of our positions. Thanks to the courageous and selfless actions of Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Yakovlev, as well as the uninterrupted supply of material and technical equipment and ammunition to the units, an impregnable defense was organized, which the superior enemy forces could not overcome. Having lost a large number of manpower and equipment during the assault, the nationalists were forced to retreat."" Corporal Matvey CALR. ""The column of the rocket artillery platoon, which included Corporal Matvey Orlov, was on the march to the designated area. Moving along the route, the platoon column came under fire from mortar guns and small arms of the enemy's sabotage reconnaissance forces. Quickly orienting himself in the situation, Corporal Orlov determined the direction from which the enemy's rifle fire was conducted, and, having given the order to subordinate personnel to occupy advantageous firing positions, taking into account the terrain, proceeded to repel the attack. Also, the crew of the unmanned aerial vehicle was tasked with conducting reconnaissance of the area in order to determine the positions of enemy mortars. During the shooting battle, Matvey, together with his subordinate personnel, repulsed the attack of the enemy's sabotage and reconnaissance group, destroying, at the same time, five nationalists and a pickup truck. At the same time, the crew of the unmanned aerial vehicle determined the location of the enemy's mortar crew, which he immediately handed over to Corporal Orlov. Matvey, together with his subordinates, in the shortest possible time transferred the combat vehicle from a marching position to a combat one. Thanks to the coordinates obtained, the MLRS crew quickly came to the target and opened fire on it, destroying two enemy mortar crews. The fire on the platoon's column ceased. Thanks to the courage, bravery and professionalism of Corporal Matvey Orlov, as well as the confident actions of his subordinates under the incessant enemy fire, the personnel of the combat vehicle crew successfully and without losses repelled the enemy's attack on the column, after which it continued to move to the specified area.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4712245/,Alexander GAMOV,2023-01-26,Vladimir Skobtsov: I have a happy opportunity to stay in Donetsk and write true poems and songs,Orpheus of Donbass - on the air of radio «Komsomolskaya Pravda»,"""Vladimir Skobtsov: Donbass ZA us and God is with us!"" This is the name of the program of the cycle ""Non-ceremonial portraits with Alexander Gamov"" - with the participation of the famous bard from the DPR Vladimir Skobtsov. He sang his songs and answered journalists' questions. (Audio and video - on the links below.. Here are a few fragments. These lines belong to the Great Poetess Junna Moritz - they became the epigraph of our program. - Volodya, - we asked the guest the first question, - your viewers are already accustomed to seeing you in a white shirt. Is it - is it like such a talisman? And - has some special meaning. - Yes, I specially wear a white shirt all 9 years of war,  which passes through our city,"" Skobtsov said. - Because Donetsk is on the front line. You know, Russian soldiers always dressed clean before battle. Because in this case, the tissue villi entering the wound did not cause infection. And yet - you stand in pure before God. And we have been standing before God for all 9 years. - So you're on constant alert for the fact that you might get hurt. -Yes. We dress clean so that there is no shame in the morgue. Donetsk residents are such people. You know, it's been a year since the special operation has been going on – all this time a city without water. A city of one million. But we don't have an epidemic, all our people are clean. The object of my attention is the people. These are the same ""ordinary people"": militiamen, soldiers, commanders, pensioners, drivers, utilities, hard workers, teachers, doctors, of course, who save lives. And I see them as blood relatives. - The song to your words ""Donbass is behind us"" has become truly nationwide. And not only for Donetsk residents, for the whole of Russia. - We are one family, we are one people, we are one big Russia. We are not fighting the Ukrainian people. We are fighting the Nazis. - You once said that Ukrainian fascism is worse than German fascism. - I will remind you of the events of the Great Patriotic War. Before retreating from Donetsk, the Germans drove the National Army - Ukrainian - into the city. And Donetsk's 4-Bis mine was littered with the bodies of people who refused to shout ""Glory to Ukraine."" They were sprinkled with dust, lime. My father was writing a book on this terrible crime That's all the Ukrainian Nazis did. And after so many years, the same slogan sounds... And in social networks from Ukrainians - a complete surprise: ""Where did you see nazis in Ukraine. My friend Roman Razum made the film ""Militia"". All the stories were taken from life - from the phones of Ukrainian soldiers. He says there is such sadism, there is so much blood that most of what they saw was not included in the film, because it cannot be shown. It's for the tribunal. - As you met on February 24, 2022, the beginning of a special military operation. - Thank God that Russia came in february. The whole of Donetsk breathed a sigh of relief. And now, no matter what is written on the Internet, on the front line - everything is fine. We are doomed to Victory. - Did you have to talk to the captured Ukrainians? Humble steels. - We broke into our hospital on Petrovka (in Donetsk). Which is now being bombed. And a doctor friend says - they curse us. He says: ""I save the life of a prisoner of war, I do general anesthesia, because I need to pull out fragments from him, and he has the last thing he said before he went into suspended animation: ""How I hate you."" - Volodya, here are the lines of one of your poems about Donbass: ""He did not bring anyone to his knees, because he will never get up himself.... - And what is behind them. - This poem is called ""My Paradise"". ""I have such a happy opportunity to stay in my hometown and if I leave, I will lose my pulse. And anything I write will be untrue. I don't want to offend anyone. People leave for various reasons – someone has children, someone has sick parents. You can't blame them for that. - But there is also another category of people, as they were called - ""frightened patriots"". - I want to quote Bulgakov: ""Never run away with a rat run to the unknown from danger."" - Volodya - you are a creative person, and creative people tend to doubt. Such a stereotype, yes... Tell me - there were throws when faced with a choice - whose side you are on. - At the very beginning (of the tragic confrontation in the Donbas) there was an obvious choice. A lot of my fellow artists are on the other side. And I was told, come on with us. But here it is – the Motherland, where my ancestors are buried, people live here, flesh from flesh and blood from blood. Here it is – the blood of a murdered child. And there are those who still say - ""not everything is so unambiguous."" And I chopped up everything that was on the other side, just a cut-off. When there is a big fight, what can be ambiguous ... ""we'll figure it out later."" In my homeland, children and old people are being killed just because they live in Donbass. Naturally, I will be on their side. And the formula of the Russian world is as follows : ""There is no other people's trouble, the trouble is one for all."" This is how the Russian people exist. And, I believe that we are not fighting with the Ukrainians, in any case! We are not fighting the Ukrainian people. We fight demons. Here, it seems, is a man in a human shell, and speaks Russian language, hardly pronouncing Ukrainian words, but - in him sits this demon. - Volodya, you often perform in hospitals and on the front line. -Yes. If you want to know something about the battles, go to the hospital to visit the wounded fighters. I remember 2014, the first military hospital in Donetsk. My statement. And I'm told, you're going to walk through the recumbents. By the inertia of a civilian, I thought: recumbent - well, the temperature is high. I walk in, and there are people lying there who, basically... Go. The wounds are incredibly severe. I see a man who has no spine almost, blown him away, and he lies facing the wall. And I understand that, as an artist, I have to lift my spirits. I sing, he extends his hand to me, shakes me and says thank you. I say thank you. He says no, let's remove the pathos, thank you for coming. I, he says, am leaving. I saw the eyes of death. And this same man, he's a hard worker, a miner, says: if I played everything back, I would again go to defend my house. These are our Heroes. People who defend their homeland are saints. You can't get mad, you can't stumble, you have to stay human. - The question is how to remain human. - The entire history of our great country teaches this. First of all, literature. Alexander Pushkin's key poem ""To the Slanderers of Russia""... He was spat upon by his liberal contemporaries for this poem, and there it was this: ""We have not recognized the brazen will of the one in front of whom you trembled."" Not knowing this poem, our militiamen with bare hands, with batons, with hunting rifles did not recognize the brazen will of the one under whom the others trembled. This is how a Russian person behaves. Listening to Volodya... How much he resembles Vladimir Vysotsky! (And these days they were just celebrating the 85th anniversary of the poet's birth.) It resembles - both in the manner of singing, and in the energy of some kind, and even - with the timbre of the voice. Therefore, we continue to ask such questions. - Volodya, is Vysotsky on our side? You said that before the interview... Now tell me what that means. - This means that if Vladimir Semyonovich were alive, he would be with us, on our side. Absolutely. This was said by my friend (the kingdom of heaven to him) - journalist Andrei Babitsky. And I agree with him. Vysotsky is where the truth is. And the truth is ours. - Tell me more, Volodya, when is the Victory? What date, what month? What does your poetic flair suggest? What song will you perform on Victory Day. - And we have no choice - to win, not to win, it will be, it will not be. Victory – it will come for sure. As Vyacheslav Molotov said in June 1941 about the war with the German fascists: ""Our cause is right, the enemy will be defeated, victory will be ours."" «... And a concert in the Semenovsky Regiment. The producer of Vladimir Skobtsov, composer, poet Leonid Zinkovsky also took part in the program ""Non-Ceremonial Portraits"". Here's what he said. - Skobtsov did not just come to Moscow. We were invited to participate in a charity concert in the Semenovsky Regiment. In addition, we have long been cooperating with the Vishnevsky Central Military Clinical Hospital, giving charity concerts. They also performed in Star City in front of astronauts. And also - in the Union of Writers of Russia. It is also an iconic place, because Volodya is one of the founders of the DPR Writers' Union. As Donbass merges into Russia, so the writers' organization of the Donetsk Republic - into the Union of Writers of Russia. And the first Honorary Member of the Union of Writers of the Unconquered Donbass was the Great Poetess Junna Moritz. Yunna Petrovna is a real fighter of the fighting Donbass!"

More than 20 Ukrainian servicemen went to the forefathers. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the troops of the ""Center"" group again delivered unpleasant surprises to the 25th and 95th airborne brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Yampolovka of the DPR and in the Serebryansky forestry. Enemy losses during the day exceeded 70 people killed and wounded. In the Donetsk direction, units of the Southern Group of Forces in the area of Konstantinovka in the DPR destroyed the artillery depot of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the South-Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions, units of the Vostok group of troops beat the enemy in the areas of Ugledar in the DPR and in Pavlovka and Levadne in the Zaporozhye region. The Armed Forces of Ukraine lost up to 60 servicemen here. For health, the best remedy is running to the west. Niklas Masur of the Center for Security Studies at ETH University zurich assessed how the supply of Leopard 2 tanks to the independent country, including equipment from other countries, will turn into a ""logistical nightmare"" for the Kiev regime. Masur concluded: ""If Ukraine wants to be able to defend itself in the long term, it is important that the logistics system is not too complex."" According to the expert, for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the way out of the coming collapse would be the option in which, along with the supply of armored vehicles, the system of maintenance and repair of tanks in the neighboring countries of Ukraine, where the technical discussion of Western artillery systems is already taking place, would work. Once again, the monkey is asked not to flirt with the grenade. But primate doesn't care anymore. Ukraine's sixth president is demanding fighter jets and long-range missiles from the North Atlantic alliance. The tragicomic admitted that the other day he chatted about the affairs of our mourners with Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General. The former actor said: ""We must unblock the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine, it is important for us to expand our cooperation in artillery, we must achieve the supply of aircraft to Ukraine. It's a dream. And that's the challenge."" Kiev clerks have already told the world that when you demand something for a long time, you will definitely be given: guns, air defense systems, tanks, missiles. And, at some point, they can give a magic pendal - to send to the moon. Too bad, not tomorrow. The Washington Post has attentive readers. They criticized U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. He talked about a ""just and lasting peace"" that would have to be ensured after the completion of the Russian special operation. The US authorities are already distributing the ""military balance of power"" after the end of the conflict in the independent country. Blinken urged to think about what a ""renewed and free"" Ukraine will look like after the SVO. Readers reminded the secretary of state that on February 2, ""Russians will celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad, in which Russia defeated Germany."" And they told Blinken that Germany's decision to send tanks to Ukraine under US pressure would further ""rally the Russians."" Don't wake up the bear in the den. The Federal Innovation Center for Nutrition, Biotechnology and Food Safety has developed special products for the military in the SVO zone. These products increase endurance, concentration of attention, mobilization of all the forces of the body. The first batches were transferred to the Kirov Military Medical Academy, the FMBA and law enforcement agencies that ensure work in the war zone. If there is a day, there will be food. An air raid alert was announced on Thursday throughout Ukraine. Once again - from the beginning of the week. The blows were inflicted on the energy structure of Ukraine. Explosions sounded in Odessa, Vinnitsa, in Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev and Mykolaiv regions. On this occasion, most areas switched to stabilization blackouts. In general, learning is light. And you have to learn from mistakes. And the sooner the better. Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the DPR, said that in the middle of the week Russian troops entered Ugledar. Ukrainian units try to counterattack, but Russian artillery is cooling their ardor. According to Kimakovsky, the task of russian forces is to take the city in pincers by analogy with Soledar. This tactic justified itself earlier - it will work now. And lovers of magic powders are waiting for another contrast shower. Viktor Medvedchuk said that a political movement is being created that will unite Ukrainians living in Russia, Europe and Ukraine itself who disagree with Zelensky's policy. According to Medvedchuk, the new movement should show that Zelensky is wrong when he declares a monolithic Ukrainian society united against Russia. The Ukrainian politician said in an interview with RT: ""When Zelensky says that behind him the ""monolith"" is the Ukrainian people, and he believes that Russia must be destroyed and the West must help in this, then I say: this is not so. When we unite these people and find out their position – and for some reason I am sure that this position is against the authorities and against Zelensky – it will be completely different. This movement will show that Ukraine is not monolithic in its views and in its alleged support for Zelensky and his criminal regime."" Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, speaking at Australia's Lowy Institute, called the government in Kiev one of the worst in the world because of its strong venality. Gates said: ""The Ukrainian government is one of the worst in the world. It is corrupt and controlled by a few rich people. This is very sad for the Ukrainian people."" In his opinion, Ukrainian black soils are much more fertile than American ones and this is generally a breadbasket for the Old World, but this great potential does not benefit ordinary citizens of the unfortunate country. We have been trying to convey such a simple truth to the world community for the past nine years - but something is wrong with the community.... LISTEN AS WELL.

The artillery of the ""Western"" group of troops in the Kupyansk direction hit the units of the 114th and 103rd territorial defense brigades in Masyutivka and Tabaivka, Kharkiv region. Enemy losses amounted to one and a half platoons. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the group of troops ""Center"" ironed the positions of the 25th and 95th airborne brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Yampolovka in the DPR and in the Serebryansky forestry. Two platoons were put out of action. In the Donetsk direction, assault squads with the fire support of the ""Southern"" group of troops liberated the village of Blagodatne in the DPR.Up to 50 Ukrainian servicemen, the French Caesar self-propelled gun, the American M-777 artillery system and the Msta-B howitzer were destroyed here during the day. In Yuzhno-Donetsk, the Vostok group of troops continued to put pressure on the positions of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Ugledar, as well as the 110th Territorial Defense Brigade in the Area of Novopol in the DPR. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this direction exceeded 40 servicemen. In Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, cotton growers also have a hard time. Which will be a counterweight to ""Hymars. Volodymyr Rogov, a member of the main council of the Zaporizhia administration of the region, said that the Tornado-S will become a counterweight to the American HIMARS system in the region. According to the official, the widespread use of Russian MLRS with guided projectiles will make it possible to accurately hit enemy positions. He recalled that the Tornado-S have a meter accuracy. On the eve of the Ministry of Defense showed footage of the combat work of the Tornado-S during the SVO. This multiple rocket launcher system destroys several Ukrainian supports in one salvo, or a transport interchange, or an ammunition depot in the deep rear. With all the richness of choice, you have no other alternative, how to run with your pants pulled up. How many billions will the MW give to Kiev. Danylo Getmantsev, a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada and head of the Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy, said that Kiev is discussing with the International Monetary Fund a new program of assistance to independent Ukraine. Its size ranges from 15 to 20 billion dollars. Hetmantsev said: ""We are working with the IMF. It could be a big program. It is designed for several years. The monitoring mission will complete its work, it was scheduled for three months and after that we will proceed to drawing up a program with the IMF."" On the eve of the National Bank of Ukraine reported that in 2023 the amount of financing provided by the West to the Kiev regime will be at least $ 38 billion. They are so willing to take this money, believing that they will not have to give it back - and if they have to, it is definitely not for them. Taras Kremin, the Commissioner for the Protection of the State Language in Ukraine, is sure that the practice of banning communication in the Russian language, introduced at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, should be extended to all universities of its own. Kremin said: ""The Higher Education Act provides for the autonomy of higher education institutions, and they should have made similar decisions long ago."" The official also cited the example of the actions of the administration of V. Karazin Kharkiv National University - they introduced the post of commissioner for the protection of the state language at the university and severely fine for violations. Well, on January 27, the administration of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy officially banned the use of the Russian language in interpersonal communication. This applies to teachers, students and administrative staff. Gogol angrily laughs and twists his finger at the temple. Where the Armed Forces of Ukraine are aimed in the Bryansk region and Belgorod region. Alexander Bogomaz, the head of the Bryansk region, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck with mortars at civilian objects of the village of Lomakovka of the Starodub municipal district. According to the governor, as a result of the Ukrainian shelling, houses, a monument to those who died during the Great Patriotic War and the building of a local store were damaged, and power supply was partially disrupted. Emergency and operational services worked at the site. On the eve of Ukraine twice shelled the village of Bezlyudnoye in the Shebekinsky urban district in the Belgorod region. Two men suffered a concussion and shrapnel wounds. Kuchma's former adviser sees Kiev collapse. Oleg Soskin, a former adviser to Leonid Kuchma, believes that Ukraine is in such a difficult situation that it is holding out solely thanks to supplies from the United States and its allies. Soskin said: ""The situation is deadlocked. So far, we see that all of Russia's power is concentrated against Ukraine. Ukraine does not produce any weapons. She has no equipment, no money, no supplies, nothing."" Without the help of the West, according to the former adviser to the second president of the independent, the country would collapse in a very short time. He discovered America. American and German tanks can make good money. In fact, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has long and officially appointed ""bonuses"" for the destruction of enemy equipment in the zone of special operation. For example. - For each tank - 100 thousand rubles. - For the plane - 300 thousand rubles. - For a helicopter - 200 thousand rubles. - For an attack drone, BMP, self-propelled gun, S-300, ""Buk"" or ""Grad"" - 50 thousand rubles. Money is transferred directly to the card of the fighter. But with NATO's announcement of supplies to Ukraine, private initiatives poured in. First, the famous actor Ivan Okhlobystin promised on behalf of ""caring businessmen"" 10 million rubles for each knocked out Western tank. Then came the ""initiatives from the field"". Alexander Osipov, the head of the Trans-Baikal Territory, promised to stimulate those Ukrainian military who want to sell Western tanks. The governor said: ""We will quickly, quickly find a formula to encourage everyone so that we get the result the whole country needs."" And on the eve of Osipov signed a decree on one-time payments to our military who seized or destroyed leopard and Abrams. The one who can capture the Leopard of any modification in a working condition is owed 3 million rubles, and those participating with him in the capture will be paid 500 thousand each. In just one tank, up to ten people can receive a payment. Also, the military will be ""awarded"" for the capture and destruction of M1 Abrams tanks or ""other main battle tanks produced in NATO countries."" Those who managed to capture such tanks in working condition will receive 1.5 million rubles, and those who helped him can count on payments in the amount of 300 thousand rubles. In the United States, they were interested in how much they steal to Kiev. A commission of the US State Department arrived in the capital of the independent country It included Diana Shaw, Robert Storch and Nicole Angarella. These overseas auditors began to check how the Kiev regime uses American military assistance. The auditors urged citizens to inform them of any information about the misappropriation of aid from the United States, promising complete anonymity. True, the auditors did not start with that - they immediately held a meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov. Understandably, one of the most crystal clear Ukrainian officials. In this manner, of course, they will dig up a lot of things... LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4714433/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-31,The head of the NSDC of Ukraine accused the Russians of the appearance of a video with roundups on conscripts in Odessa and Kharkov,"Meanwhile, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists and followers of other foreign sects were freed from mobilization in the independent country.","I don't even know how to tell you about this monstrous effectiveness of the Kremlin's hands and feet. In general, as it turned out, it is the Russians who shoot fakes on the streets of Odessa, Nikolaev, Kharkov and even Lviv about the capture of Ukrainians subject to mobilization and post them on the Web. The all-powerful Russians, while the whole of Ukraine is fighting them, have made their way to all the streets, seized public transport, entered the bomb shelters, and forcibly grabbed and wrought ukrainians liable for military service. Such a masterpiece pearl was issued on Tuesday by the head of the NSDC of Ukraine Alexei Danilov. After that, it became finally clear why, on the one hand, he was called a lawyer a veterinarian, and on the other hand, why ""Lenya Myashka"" was stuck somewhere at the bottom of the career criminal ladder. - There are queues near the military recruitment office. Where our institution is located, there are military enlistment offices next to us - in the morning, from seven or eight there people stand in line and calmly, verified to check their data, if necessary, certain procedures are carried out, there is nothing like this here, - said this person-pedestal and explained, - And the Russian Federation launches fakes that have nothing to do with our situation. In our country, people voluntarily stand in line at the military recruitment offices. You think he's just such a fool that he believes in what he carries. Of course not. Fools from criminal gangs did not heal for a long time in this world. Danilov is an extremely, or rather, infinitely cynical person who will lie in the eyes. Moreover, in this situation, Mr. Danilov quite clearly and prudently sent his children- conscripts to Miami, where they from the moment of the beginning of the SVO to this day, not sparing their stomach and their very lives, defend the Atlantic coast of the United States from possible aggression by Russia. And he could not send, but just attach. Since the Government of Ukraine issued a decree here on who, in addition to the usual citizens of Independence who fall under the deferral, has a reservation from the front. As it turned out, these are quite numerous citizens from several groups at once. Those who are involved in the process of distributing and delivering Western aid to Ukraine, as well as representatives of foreign organizations, are not subject to mobilization. For example, managers and all sorts of different managers from the funds of Soros and their ilk. And yet, just don't laugh, fans of all sorts of foreign religious cults, like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists and the like. One can feel the care of foreign curators about their own personnel reserve, which, in their understanding, will have to manage this territory. Such should be protected and not thrown under fire on a par with the usual ""cannon fodder"". But for representatives of traditional religious denominations, such indulgences are not provided. Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk also sat in a puddle. Although the journalist almost tortured him, trying to get an answer, they say, if Ukraine is all united and everything as one, then why don't parliamentarians or at least their children fight at the front. Stefanchuk crumpled for a long time, complained, sweat flowed from his excessively portly face in a tropical downpour, but he could not remember any of the children of the top of the Ukrainian government. But Stefanchuk was able to name as many as two deputies out of 423 MPs, who, according to him, are fighting on the very front. True, he could not explain how they in this case are at every meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, where they regularly vote for the proposed bills. And it was obvious that he really did not like these questions, but he volunteered where to go. Right now, Ukrainian officials and deputies have so many opportunities for theft and kickbacks that they are not up to trifles. And there is also medical care in the form of medicines and materials, and there is food humanitarian aid, clothing, personal protective equipment, and much more. The day feeds the year. Your eyes run away from the cornucopia of possibilities, and you come to them with questions. Give up these stupid things, panove ordinary Ukrainians. And go in line at the draft boards to become. And then it's awkward as if Danilov is lying. And stop filming all these escapes, jumps and other sports games with patrols. Everyone understands that it is Ukrainian athletes who train like this, and do not try to escape without receiving a summons. It is possible that by the 2024 Olympics. LISTEN AS WELL.

The video shows footage from a drone hunting for a fighter. It looks like this is the signalman who went to check on the damaged antenna. This is often how Ukrainians act: one drone blows up equipment, and the second guards when repairmen appear. In the next second, the drone throws a grenade launcher shot at the fighter, the explosion thunders, the warrior falls and freezes on the ground. Then the drone operator hovers over his body for a few seconds, and then descends to film the Russian chevron on his jacket and the face of the defeated. And at this moment, the fighter ""comes to life"", grabs the drone on the fly and looks into the camera. The shooting ends when the fighter with his tactical gloves begins to break the screws of the soulless killer. ""Handsome, a real Russian bear. And a real guide on how a soldier can escape from a drone that is going to drop a grenade, ""readers will write on the network. On the frames you can distinguish the features of the warrior's face and two chevrons on his chest - with a bear and with a Russian flag. Is it possible to survive in such situations? Old-timers on the network give different advice. - Do not move in open areas and listen. - If you hear the sound of motors or notice a drone try to shoot it down with small arms. (Many succeed, and the enemy operator will try to protect his ""bird"" and find another target). If the attack did start. - Jump sharply away from the place of rupture and roll on the ground without stopping. - Change direction, do not stop until cover is found. - VOG (fragmentation grenade launcher shot) - explodes immediately upon impact on the ground. - F-1 and RGD-5 grenades - with a delay of 3 seconds. The latter can be tried to be discarded if they fell side by side in a trench. It is theoretically possible to escape from an offensive grenade - RGD-5 - with a scattering of fragments up to 25 meters. From the defensive - F-1 - with a zone of generation of fragments up to 200 meters, it is impossible even in theory. So when a grenade explodes, it is better to lie down in the lowlands, behind a tree or any other natural barrier. The network suggested that two fighters could participate in the capture of the enemy drone at once. Like, colleagues studied the behavior of the cameraman, who, after throwing the VOG, each time descended to consider and shoot on camera his next victim close-up. Military personnel decided to catch a bloodthirsty drone on a ""live bait"". When the drone descended to the soldier who fell to the ground, another fighter ran up to him from the rear and knocked him to the ground with a blow of a branch. LISTEN AS WELL.

This is the next city after Artemovsk (Bakhmut) on the way of Russian troops. Why in The Hours of Yar. - This is the only settlement through which the Ukrainian troops in Artemovsk (Bakhmut. - Ed.) are still fed with ammunition and reinforcements. From Chasova Yar it is convenient to strike in almost all directions from where our troops are advancing. Up to five different Ukrainian brigades are deployed in Chasov Yar, three of them are airborne assault brigades. This is an opportunity to build a new fortified area there, cling to it and continue to contain the Russian offensive. At the same time, it is quite possible that our offensive will also come from the direction of Horlivka. Then there is the risk that Chasov Yar may soon be cut off from the main Ukrainian forces. - There are alarming signals that in Chasov Yar now Ukrainian soldiers put on the uniform of ""Wagnerians"" and move around the city. - Personally, I haven't seen it. But I've heard it happen. At the same time, we remember how, during the storming of Soledar, the ""Wagnerians"" put on Ukrainian uniforms and walked around the rear, destroying the staff command of the Ukrainian forces. This applies on both sides. This sabotage work was used during the Second World War. - They say that the Ukrainian special services are looking for pro-Russian citizens and arrange reprisals against them, filming it on video. - There was a similar provocation in Bucha. But here, it is quite possible, this technique is used in two forms at once. And to destroy the pro-Russian population under the guise of ""Wagnerites"", creating a provocation. And in order to sabotage the rear of the attackers. Because Russian forces have already entered Directly into Artemovsk, where heavy fighting is being fought. In addition, they talk about a large number of foreigners who arrived in Ukraine, who should soon be near Artemivsk.

The same ""Leopards"", according to Berlin, will go to Ukraine in two stages - in the first batch in three months new cars will be delivered. In the second, apparently, what will be collected from storage. It is unlikely that Ukraine will store all these supplies until an offensive tank fist is assembled. This means that the incoming cars will go straight to the front in portions. Which, of course, is preferable for us. We will burn them in small batches. And you can burn them, the same history of the Abrams shows this. In the Persian Gulf during the 1990-1991 war, 23 Abrams were destroyed. During the first two years of the Iraq War of 2003-2011, more than 100 vehicles were put out of action. The Houthis destroyed about 45 Abrams from the Saudis.

That's when it's the norm for us, then it's Donbass.""","Acting head of the DPR told on radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" about the boundaries of the special operation, the cessation of shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the return of residents to Donetsk","There are traffic jams at the entrance to Donbas - everyone is traveling along a new route to Crimea. It is these traffic jams that prevent us from reducing prices in Donetsk stores to the average Russian level. This and much more was told by the acting head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin on the air of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"". And we also asked him: when in the DPR pensions will become the same as in other regions and why it is vital for Donetsk to liberate the Kharkiv region. - Denis Vladimirovich, we see that Donetsk and other cities of the republic are still shelled by Ukraine. Yes, they are shelled like never before. Can this be changed. - The process of liberation is not easy. The enemy has no internal barriers, barriers or restrictions. If they have the opportunity to shoot at our people and infrastructure, they will definitely do it. So the only way to stop the shelling is to push it back. Moreover, to do this taking into account the weapons supplied by him. Of course, we would very much like to see this happen faster. But I perfectly understand all the realities. Our guys are doing everything possible and impossible on the front line, and progress is taking place. Maybe by steps, not by running, but it happens. - Zelensky gave the command to defend Artemovsk at any cost. Why did they cling to him so much? They have the most serious line of defense there. - They have several serious lines of deeply layered defense. It was possible to talk about Mariupol, and now about the Ugledar direction, and about Avdiivka, and including Artemovsk. From Artemovsk the road opens to Kramatorsk and Slavyansk. But no less tangible for them will be the loss of Ugledar - so they transfer reserves there. As for Avdiivka, when we liberate it, they will lose the opportunity to shell Donetsk, and Kiev, Kuibyshev districts, and Yasynuvataya. So they will resist. - We see the movement of Russian troops. Where it's going. - The goal does not change, it is obvious to us: there are constitutional borders of the Donetsk People's Republic, within which we returned to greater Russia. But it is worth considering the threat posed by enemy shelling. Therefore, we will have to push him further away - from the constitutional borders of the DPR, so that he physically cannot reach us. And, taking into account the weapons that he will have at that time. - You can name the timing. - I wouldn't be kidding that ""tomorrow or the day after tomorrow everything will be fine, and the enemy will calm down"". Won't rest. And we understand that. And we still have many steps to liberate the remaining part of Ukraine and to protect the interests of our country - Russia. - In addition to shelling, a huge huge problem for Donetsk is water. It's not there. Really, it won't be until Slavyansk is liberated? After all, water was supplied from there to almost the entire Donbas. - Let's take it one step at a time. The first thing Kiev did when it all started was the blockade. This is their policy since 2014 - an economic blockade, a transport blockade. All possible restrictions. They understood perfectly well that the water blockade would be very sensitive for us. And they could do it, because Slavyansk, from where everything is controlled, was under their control. You see, this is how our region was built - they were fed through an artificial canal, the Seversky Donets. He provided us with water. And by blocking it, a very big problem was created. - How do you deal with this now. - The first thing we did on our part, of course, with support at the federal level, was to use the reservoirs that we have. Including backup. 7 water pipelines were built there. It's a lot of work to feed, to transfer from one reservoir to another... But they still can't provide for all of our needs. - We have to turn off the water in the cities. - This is a forced measure for us. It's painful enough for all of us. Water is now supplied for 2 hours once every 3 days. But even with such a limited regime, we have almost exhausted the reservoirs. - We are informed that a water pipeline is being built from the Rostov region. - In order to first of all support our water supply regime, and secondly to improve the situation, a decision is made to lay a water pipeline from the Don. It's 194 kilometers - two lines. The military construction company is extending it in a fairly record time. By April 1, these two lines should allow the expansion of the water supply schedule. - This will cover the needs of Donbass. - Unfortunately, no. This is again a temporary measure that will allow us to wait for the moment when we will liberate Slavyansk as well. - The Ukrainians will destroy all the water infrastructure that is there. - Without a doubt, we have no illusions here. But we have already done some work here: we have already prepared the equipment in order to start restoring the water supply as soon as possible. - Then you can breathe freely. - There's another nuance there. Further, they will have the opportunity to block the water already on the territory of the Kharkiv region. So for us there is a need to liberate this territory. And then Donbass will be fully provided with water. - Our military officer Dmitry Steshin, who now lives in Donetsk, was very happy when the customs and border controls between the DPR and the Rostov region were canceled. There was hope that prices in stores would fall, but this did not happen. Why. - Yes, we now have an administrative border, not a state border. But we can't remove the checkpoints. -Why. - There is a big threat of terrorist activity from Ukraine. Unfortunately, here they can have sabotage groups. We are used to it and have learned to deal with them. But if they fall with weapons, explosives on the territory of the Rostov region and spread across Russia, then it will be much more difficult to fight this. Therefore, we control the departure from the territory of the republic. - And there are queues at the checkpoint. - Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to cope with them to the fullest. Why do they appear? There are certain difficulties with the Crimean bridge and the flow of civilians, goods that are transported to the Crimea, to the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, poured through us. That's the first thing. Second. This is a massive construction project that is underway in the republic. We had 40,000 construction workers at the peak. Taking into account transport, building materials, this is a large load. The third reason is our citizens who are leaving. We are just building an MFC system. They work literally from Monday and then with limited functionality. People are forced to go to the Rostov region to get the services they need. - And the prices have something to do with it. - And all this left an imprint on the carriers. If we evened out the issues on the legislation - we had a different taxation system, VAT refund. But the cost of transporting goods... For example, a car that carries goods from Moscow to the Rostov region or to the Kuban makes three walks a week. And when the same carrier travels in us, he can make one walk in a week. That is, the price for the same transportation service in the DPR is 2-2.5 times higher. This is reflected in prices. - How will you solve the problem. - With the Ministry of Transport, with Marat Khusnullin (Deputy Prime Minister - ed.), we have worked out these issues. We will double the checkpoint, we will add additional items, we will expand the roads. But this issue is not solved at the snap of a finger. It takes time. And we see the prices in the store now. We are trying to negotiate with retail chains. They lower the price. According to Rosstat, the price is reduced by an average of 10-12%. - So someone is also trying to cash in on this. - There were overstatements somewhere. Here we have both the government and the prime minister himself, they check the networks. We try to get to the bottom of what the reason is. Well, you know, we don't have a magic wand that you can wave, and everything is fine at once. But we definitely don't give up. And we understand perfectly well what we will do tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. - Your pensions are now the same as in the rest of the country. - It's also a process. We are completely switching to Russian legislation. Now at the federal level, a bill is being considered, according to which we will be able to proceed to the recalculation of pensions. Let's start somewhere on March 1. But that's not immediate, either. We have under a million pensioners. And this work needs to be carried out physically - everything should be recalculated. In general, the task is clear - pensions should be the same as in other regions of the Russian Federation. Allowances and other support - too. - What's the problem here. - Yes very simple. Here's a simple example: maternity capital. There is a solution, money is given. But! Only Russian citizens can receive it. Confirmation - Russian passport. And our people are already Russians, but not everyone has received passports. You can already give birth to a child, but do not have a passport yet. And so on every nuance. We are now paying a lot of attention to these nuances. - What has changed in general with the inclusion in Russia. - First of all, it is a feeling that we are finally at home. This opens up new opportunities for us. - We have released several materials where we tried to predict whether Donbass will be a subsidized region. - For us, this is an unusual state when we are helped. We want to help. That's when it's the norm for us, then it's Donbass. We will make the region self-sufficient for ourselves and will help others. I'm pretty sure of that. - What's wrong with people? We have already counted how many have left over the years. - It should be borne in mind that now migration continues. From the settlements that are under fire, people are trying to leave. And as a day or two, the shelling stops - they return. Someone finds work outside the republic and settles there, and someone lived in another region, feels that the house is a house and goes back. We are a subject of the Russian Federation, people are returning. - What is the current population of Donetsk. - Taking into account the evacuation that took place last February, taking into account the SVO, from 800 thousand to a million people remain in the city. You can now come to Donetsk and see traffic jams. Even Mariupol has already come to life. Yes, there are a lot of difficulties, a lot of destruction, but from March-April-May it is a completely different city. Even there, traffic jams appear, roads are being repaired, shops are opening, new neighborhoods have appeared. - We know Pushilin the politician quite well, but not so much about Denis Pushilin personally. Are you married? You have children. -Married. I have three daughters. I always wanted a son. I don't intend to stop. My wife, together with our ombudsman, was engaged in helping children: boarding schools, orphanages. That was before the February evacuation. Now she pays more attention to rhythmic gymnastics. She is the honorary president of the federation. He tries to build her work. This is the participation of our athletes in various competitions, in the Russian championship and so on. This is its main direction. And for me, the most important thing is that it does not distract me from work. I'm fine with that. Our younger daughters are engaged in rhythmic gymnastics. They are workaholics - daily training for six to seven hours. With one day off a week. The middle daughter is already a candidate master of sports. The youngest pulls after her. LISTEN AS WELL.

And you are in Moscow or in Chita. - I'm in Moscow now. Hello. - Thank God, otherwise I think it's night in Chita. (The call was at 20 GMT.) And I'm the name here. First of all, the traditional question is: how is our Hero in the SVO zone? (We are talking, of course, about the former mayor of Chita Alexander Sapozhnikov, who in November resigned from the post of mayor and went to the SVO zone. - I think Alexander, you understood what he was talking about there - in our recent communication session - about new tasks, about the assault unit, as part of which he actively participates in the assault. - Well, this should have been expected from him. Because - a combat man,  went through the Chechen war, and served in the army for more than a dozen years, that's it. - Yes, yes. - No more news from him? Like there, what. - No, as I went to this new stage then, now there is no connection. We will pray that everything will be good, that they will complete all the tasks and that they will be alive and healthy. - Sure, sure. let us pray, let us wait for him with victory. But we were also very interested in the information that ""the Trans-Baikal governor signed a decree on payments from 100 thousand to 3 million rubles to residents of the region who manage to destroy or capture Leopard or Abrams tanks in the special operation zone. -Yes. - So, can you comment on what meaning you meant when you signed this document. - We, all Transbaikalia, are now diligently helping the warriors with all our might. All that our citizens can do is sew, produce, assemble, send, and so on. Cars, wagons – everything you can. Even the buzy was plastered and sent to the SVO zone a truck buz. And our neighbors, too, are Buryatia and the Amur Region. - What's the point. - Buzy even plastered. - Buzy. This, who does not know, is a national Buryat dish, they were apparently frozen before being sent. It's something like manta rays. - Yes, a big open dumpling. - Oops, cool. -Delicious. In general, we do everything we can. And we are well aware that our compatriots are sitting in trenches, many are participating in the assault of the most important, I will not be able to disclose this information, but our guys are in the most responsible areas. - That's understandable. - Well, as for the payouts... Those guys who will destroy these vaunted Western tanks, we want to support and thank in every possible way. Including, on the part of the Government and the Trans-Baikal Territory, to add some money to them for this. - Tell me, please, why is such a ""fork"" - from 100 thousand rubles to 3 million? If you hit a caterpillar, 100,000? If it's a tower. - There we have the following payments: for the capture of the Leopard - 3 million, for the capture of the Abrams or any other main battle tanks produced by NATO countries - 1.5 million rubles. And this is due, first of all, to the fact that ... well, I myself am a tanker, I served in Dnepropetrovsk, in Krivoy Rog and so on. - So you're a tanker, yes. -Tanker. So... look, other NATO tanks are still, well, inferior, in my opinion, according to my knowledge, to the Leopard, especially the latest modifications. It's -,times. But the second thing is, most importantly, there is nothing to do at all for any foreign equipment on our land, and even more so for German tanks. It's outrageous, such a brazen challenge. Therefore, of course, for the ""Leopard"" you need to pay, definitely, more. Others cost less, and, of course, there is a different motivation here. Here. And payments ... - one thing, directly to the fighter who hit, destroyed the tank. Another thing is that the fighters must act coherently. Therefore, the work of the entire unit should be taken into account here. And all those who will participate in the operation to capture or destroy tanks, they also deserve a reward. Therefore, they, depending on participation - up to 150 thousand rubles for assistance in this combat operation. - But if your guys-Transbaikalians, I also know them well, studied (I lived in Transbaikalia for 5 years) will begin to burn these tanks by the dozens and knock out whether you have enough money in the treasury to pay bonuses for each downed Leopard. - I'm sure there's enough money. And even if there is a problem with the treasury, our people collect money, and enterprises will help - there is no money for this. - So, let's write it down: for each Leopard - 3 million, for each Abrams - 1.5. - One and a half, yes. Abrams, Challenger, Leclerc and all the rest of their, one and a half of them, yeah. But it's certainly not about the money. The main thing is that our guys are defending the Motherland.

Which loses up to 20 billion hryvnia (more than 37 billion rubles) due to shadow sales of fuel. People who are losing the country are afraid of losing 500 million euros... Igor Kirillov, the head of the radiation, chemical and biological protection troops of the Russian Armed Forces, said that Ukraine was testing psycho-stimulating and narcotic drugs on military personnel. On the basis of the Military Institute of The Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the drug ""Anti-Fatigue"" was tested. Kirillov said: ""There are facts about the use of psychostimulating and narcotic drugs by servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the conduct of primary clinical trials on soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the drug ""Antiustalost"". The trials involved five male volunteers weighing about 70 kilograms under the age of 35 years. Their fate is sad. As well as the whole independent. Rod Dreher, a columnist for The American Secretariat, reports that the American people are misled about the situation in Ukraine, the Americans do not even suspect what a ""whirlpool"" the leadership is dragging them into. Dreher asks, ""What will Americans say when they wake up one day and see that their army has crossed the border into Ukraine and is fighting Russian soldiers?"" The journalist is convinced: ""Ukraine is the second Vietnam, but with the risk of a direct military conflict with a nuclear superpower."" And in Washington, they drink spicy cocktails – they drink, and wait for news. Andrei Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel of the LPR people's militia, said that a medical worker from the United States was seriously injured during the detonation of ammunition during the disposal of the belongings of the dead servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, the explosion occurred in one of the medical institutions in the temporarily occupied part of the DPR, when the personal belongings of the deceased were burned. During the incident, a technical worker of the medical institution was mortally wounded. Earlier it became known that new mercenaries from the United States and Britain began to arrive in the conflict zone a week ago. Fools continue to learn from their mistakes posthumously. Denis Shmygal, the prime minister of The Independent State, announced his power's intention to join the EU by 2025. At the same time, according to Politico, the West considers such plans unrealistic. Shmygal states: ""We have a very ambitious plan to join the EU within the next two years. Therefore, we expect that this year, we may already have a preliminary stage of negotiations."" But Politico believes that the two-year term of the Ukrainian authorities challenges the leadership of the European Union. And ""many of the old guard"" of the European Union believe that by being a ""global agricultural superpower,"" Ukraine could weaken their privileges and powers. Yeah, it's still that laxative... Since February 2022, more than 5.2 million refugees have already arrived on the territory of the Russian Federation from the territory of the independent country. Of these, 733 thousand are children. Almost 900 temporary stay points have been organized for refugees in Russia. But less than a percent of those who left the neighboring country visited them - most of the visitors from the neighboring state stayed with relatives or solved the issue of living privately. The Chancellor of Germany and during his visit to Latin America had to comment on the topic of Ukraine. When Scholz was asked about the supply of combat aircraft to Kiev, the head of Germany could hardly restrain himself: ""In such important things as weapons, it should be about facts, about rational weighing. That says it all."" He added that instead of supporting Ukraine, domestic political motives are brought to the fore. Scholz, during a visit to Chile, stressed that he and the US president ruled out the introduction of ""no-fly zones"" at the very beginning of the conflict, ""because this would lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO."" Well, tanks, it's like, ""pampering."" Croatian President Zoran Milanovic expressed concern that all the tanks that Germany, the United States and a number of other NATO countries will transfer to Kiev will be destroyed by the Russian army. As well as those that were transferred earlier from the reserves of Soviet times. The head of the Balkan country also expressed the opinion that the recognition of Kosovo by a number of Western countries, which ""was taken away from Serbia,"" should inevitably ""lead to something similar from Moscow."" Milanovic stressed that ""Crimea will never again be part of Ukraine."" And who doubts that. LISTEN AS WELL. Futurologist told what to expect in Russia in 2023 (more)"

Privates, sergeants, corporals and officers who showed their professional experience, character and performed combat missions. Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""In fact, there is nothing more harmful, and even more – no one can be as cruel as sentimental people are in the results of their actions. A person who loves his neighbors, a person who hates war, must finish off the enemy, so that another war does not begin after one,"" said Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, who did not lose a single battle. And the warriors taught: ""In the battle in the field there are three attacks: the first in the wing, which is weaker. It's not good in the middle – they will squeeze himself. A bypass attack is only good for a small hull."" HE REPELLED THE ATTACK NATIONALIST. Sergeant Sergei Frolo. ""During a special military operation, the commander of the automotive platoon, Sergeant Sergey Frolov, together with his subordinates, repeatedly made flights to areas located in the immediate vicinity of the contact line for the purpose of operational and uninterrupted support of the units. One day, having delivered ammunition to a settlement liberated from militants, Sergei, together with the detachment, entered into battle with nationalists who attempted to regain control of the village. Being on the front line of the defense line under the constant dense fire of enemy mortar artillery at the platoon strongpoint, he carried out a fire defeat to the advancing enemy from an armored personnel carrier. Acting boldly and decisively, Sergei constrained the actions of the enemy, who attempted to bypass the platoon strongpoint from the flank. The bold and decisive actions of Sergei Frolov made it possible to repel the attack of the nationalists and cause significant damage to the manpower and equipment of the militants. "" THE ENEMY MADE THE ATTACK SUFFOCATE. Junior Sergeant Valery Kapichniko. ""The gun crew under the command of Junior Sergeant Valery Kapichnikov performed a combat mission to suppress the enemy's artillery positions when repelling his offensive against the positions of Russian troops. During the battle, Junior Sergeant Kapichnikov promptly transmitted the coordinates of the location of the enemy's artillery units, and also immediately corrected the fire of the gun. Despite the return fire, the crew under the command of Junior Sergeant Valery Kapichnikov boldly changed the firing position and continued to inflict a fire defeat on the enemy's artillery positions. Thanks to Valery's clear and decisive actions, the crew was able to gain fire superiority over the enemy and destroy two self-propelled artillery installations, knocking out the enemy's artillery in this direction. After that, the crew of Junior Sergeant Kapichnikov continued to systematically shell the attacking units of the enemy, destroying 5 armored fighting vehicles and up to 20 people of nationalist personnel. Thanks to the clear and courageous actions of Junior Sergeant Kapichnikov, the enemy's attack stalled, and our motorized rifle units were able to launch a counterattack and, pushing back the Nazis, take more advantageous lines and positions.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4713039/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-01-28,Russian tankmen behind Lisichansk about NATO armored vehicles: On our land they have little chance,Military KP.RU Dmitry Steshin found out that Russian tankers on the front line are thinking about supplying NATO weapons to Ukraine,"Colleagues adore apocalyptic epithets and comparisons, ""catch up with drama"" in reports. The worst thing is that sometimes their comparisons are correct. Taken at the end of the summer, Severodonetsk was often called the ""Luhansk Mariupol"" and this is the pure truth. Lisichansk got an order of magnitude less. The two cities look out at each other across the river. The tank battalion where I am waiting is based on the other side of the Seversky Donets. The bridges are blown up, the navigator does not understand what I need from him and drives, leads me through dead quarters, as if he specifically shows THIS. Crippled high-rise buildings do not surprise me, but I see the ""cemetery of windows"" for the first time - a huge pile of white broken double-glazed windows. Severodonetsk is put in order and construction waste is brought here. Two men tinker on these piles, looking for surviving frames, removing window fittings. The men are rustic, and they have also gone through battles, they do not want to wait for them to make windows, they twist as best they can. A six-year-old boy on the side of the road is waving at our car. He says that ""I don't go to kindergarten anymore."" When he grows up, he will ""become strong."" ""Dad at work, mom at home"" is already good, the rest will get better. A touched comrade with a crunch tears off the Russian chevron from his sleeve, which went with him through the whole of Mariupol and hands it to the boy. Finally, I find a pontoon crossing. They agreed to meet with the tankers at one of the blown up bridges. The road is blocked by a sign ""Mines"", but mines are not put on the asphalt, and I do not walk on the roadsides anyway ... I descend from the high bank down. Granite monument to the general of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who was killed here in 2014. Ours do not fight with monuments, even enemy ones, I have seen this many times. I know the tankers from August in absentia: for almost a year I helped equip them, informationally supported the training camp. Of the most important, we, with caring fellow citizens, made a connection for the guys by buying a very expensive relay station. And it turns out that I came to August not as a flying reporter in search of sensations, but as a long-time assistant or associate. It was felt. I was met by Sasha the tanker (as it was recorded in the phone), as I was surprised to learn, he has a twin brother Alex and they fight side by side. In 2019, Sasha simply came from Novorossiysk to Lugansk to visit his brother, and so he stayed to fight with him. First by the gunner-operator, then by the mechvod. On the road, I put on my armor and helmet and take it off in the house. They show me the bed – the stove is in her legs, not everyone understands how great it is. The TV mutters, they make it louder on the news and everyone watches it. Everywhere, in every corner, radios are charged – tankers are preparing for the next day. It begins early and ends at dusk. At night, tanks, or as they are called here, ""elephants"" or ""noses"" do not work, at least from these positions. The shot unmasks too much. The Razor Lockbox pours me my first cup of coffee, and I still have no idea we'll talk to him well into the night. ""Razor"" tells how the battalion took Severodonetsk and learned to fight in dense pine forests, how once here, they again had to learn. In general, according to ""Razor"", training in tank troops, the occupation is continuous. - We were lucky, there was an intelligent colonel of the Russian army nearby. He tells us, ""Don't you know how to shoot from closed positions?"" We were used to storming with direct fire, there were protractors on the guns, but we removed them so as not to interfere with loading. We started looking for them, putting them back. Some have already had glass level capsules broken. We went to hardware stores, bought, put the levels back. Shot. Work. In our direction in the village on the edge of a huge forest-reserve, the Armed Forces of Ukraine organized a local ""meat grinder"" for its fighters. New units are brought in every three days, and our tankers and artillery knock them out. The guys storming Bakhmut are really easier from this. The front line is a single organism, everything is interconnected there. As in the battalion. - We have a charger, it is called ""water"", it works on water. I don't understand, and Razor unfolds the plot. - They had problems with the automatic loader in the tank, wear and tear. And you have to work. ""Water"" what does it do? He undresses from the waist up, takes with him a five-liter eggplant of water. Attention! Half drink at once, and then begins to throw shells. Sometimes it sucks out of the eggplant. From the outside you look – the automatic loader works, but somehow it is too fast. Along with the darkness, it begins to fly lazily through our village. The Razor tells me. - Don't worry, he puts it in the gardens. Exactly, these same gardens were laid all night. And I suspect that in this inaccuracy of enemy fire was hidden some of our military cunning or ingenuity. ""Razor"" tells how the battalion rolled out to the last line in front of Severodonetsk - high-rise buildings were already visible. I got up in the pine forest, dug in. The enemy is in the same forest, but on high-rises, and in the middle is a swampy old floodplain of the river. - They started to cover us up. The headquarters was made in a steel container, three rolls with a sand pad. Never punched, by the way. But I feel that with such a dense fire we will have losses. What should I do? - Razor smiles slyly. - Sent fifteen fighters into a nearby forest to burn fires. At night, to burn brightly, during the day, to smoke a little. Well, all the shells went there. But, I feel, the situation is heating up, they will attack us. They made a false ammunition depot, they did not disguise it. It hit, of course, gunpowder flashed, the glow ... After that, they went on the attack, hoping, of course, that we no longer had ammunition. - How the locals met you. - It seems to be countrymen, but they have been hiding for a long time. We see that people are having a hard time. They started feeding, and they started going outside. The guy is there, handy, he was collecting firewood in the woods, a shell fell nearby, five pieces of shrapnel in his back. I told him: ""you are not in a shirt, you were born in a sweatshirt"", I took him to the hospital, made sure that everything was done as it should be. Now he helps us fix the technique. ""Razor"" thinks hard, perhaps does not really want to tell: - But when they took one village there was a grandmother, a well-known moonshiner throughout the district, the house is huge, prosperous. A dill shell then flew into it. In the house they found her records, she recorded everything - the movement of equipment, who stands where and how many fighters. Like the old man was, in years, why did she need it? Don't understand. I wake up to the fact that all the radios spoke at once. Reconnaissance identified targets. A battalion air corrector arrives and he will record hits. There are two main goals: a house where an enemy platoon sits and a mortar position. Razor and I go to where the tanks are being prepared to enter positions: servicing, refueling and charging. And they repair. Separately, there is a sad ""elephant"" - it was naturally lined with high-explosive fragmentation shells two days ago. The crew is alive, and judging by the mats and the tools laid out, the tank began to be repaired. Twin brothers, fix a harsh thread on the cut of the barrel of a tank gun, with a cross. Half a kilometer away is a white target. It's a ""cold shot"" before going into position. Then one of the brothers remarks , ""leads to the left."" They begin to tighten the caterpillar. I take a moment to talk to them. I ask, how does the enemy behave? Says Brother Alexei, call sign ""Naum"". - In the early days he retreated, now, he had time, dug in, concreted-sheathed, holds on to positions and even tries to break through. But we still destroy it every day, knock out targets. It's time for Naum to move forward, I'm distracting, but I'm still asking this question. - You're worried about your brother. - I'm worried about everyone, for the tankers, for our infantry, but my brother... it's a brother! Naum's face at these words somehow brightens up like a ray of sunshine. The sun will be there, but while it stands very low, a short winter day is just beginning. We are going to leave after the tanks coming to the closed positions. And I understand that I have the last opportunity to calmly discuss with the castle commander the main topic of all the talk shows in the country. - Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of Western tanks. What were they promised? ""Leopards"", ""Abrams"", ""Challengers""? People who will never encounter these tanks in battle claim that ""it's okay."" Your opinion is like a warrior who will burn them. - The first thing we take as a basis is ""the enemy should not be underestimated"". We will find approaches to them. But, as it seems to me, the enemy has few chances on our land. Our winters are harsh, but our equipment is adapted to them. - Do you think Western crews will put this equipment on it. -I think so. As practice shows, transplanting a tanker to new equipment is not the work of one day or even a month. I had one company of ""seventy-twos"" in the unit, the rest on the ""sixty-fours."" After the start of the SVO, we updated the vehicles, so the T-72 tankers had to learn, a lot of things surfaced that they simply do not understand. The guys who have been fighting on these machines for years are helping, they show and explain. I mean, they're still learning. - The logical question is how the Armed Forces of Ukraine will serve these tanks. - Yes, it's a continuous repair, after almost every battle! We need to supply a bunch of spare parts! And the ammunition? As my practice shows, their supply to tankers should be continuous. How much Western equipment will work here without serious repairs. Well, a month. - Let's say they bring in a tank company of Leopards. - A tank company a thousand kilometers of the contact line? Here you can only laugh, in no way it will change the situation. We finished this talk show on the positions from which the battalion worked ""on the enemy"". We did not stay there for long – the enemy snapping artillery and mortars, lining the ways of approach to these positions. As the Razor elegantly noted. - A tank is not afraid of a mortar and a shell, of course, but still, when hit or close to arrival, ""tungsten shakes hard in the heads"". The Razor roughly remembers how many concussions he has – eight or nine. Indeed, the common definition of ""iron people"" does not fit them. ""Tungsten"" will be more accurate. Tungsten is harder, it is no coincidence that the cores of armor-piercing shells are made of it. LISTEN AS WELL. Futurologist told what to expect in Russia in 2023 (more)"

""Orpheus of Donbass"", as Volodya Yunna Moritz called it. - I know him. - We will send you the video. There will be time – take a look. There are interesting songs and wording. -Thank you. - And Volodya told us that they honor Vyacheslav Molotov. And today we hear his special words, which he said in June 1941: ""Our cause is right, the enemy will be defeated, victory will be ours."" Skobtsov told us that your grandfather before the war - he had the surname Scriabin then - headed first the Donetsk City Committee, then the regional party committee. My wife and I searched (she and I conducted this program together), searched – but did not find confirmation that this is all true. - No, first of all, my grandfather had been Molotov since 1916, of course. And he was known as Molotov. And there, in Nizhny Novgorod, from where Vyacheslav Mikhailovich came to Donbass, he was the chairman of the executive committee, and then he was transferred to donbass. And there he became the chairman of the regional – then provincial party committee. And then, quite quickly, he moved to Kharkov, then became the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. And already from this position at the Tenth Party Congress he became secretary of the Central Committee. - And this phrase: ""Our editing business"" - they, in general, are very fond, very revered. And they consider it their slogan. And Russkiy Mir (I would like to remind readers and listeners of Radio KP – this is the name of the foundation you head) – is also well known. - And we highly revere Vladimir Skobtsov. And also, I think, in 2014 they awarded him the Russian World Prize. So, we know this bard well too. - We carefully watch on TV, on the Persian channel, your program ""The Big Game"" - it has become not only analytical, but also operational. That is, you respond to literally all the news, events that are happening right now. I was among the journalists who covered the meeting between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden in Geneva on June 16, 2021. And for some reason it seems to me that a new Geneva will come. But when? Who does it depend on? And will the same Biden not understand that he needs to be elected again and still needs to make some compromises? What can we expect? What are the predictions. - You first started talking about the program... Indeed, at first it was analytical, but it became information and analytical. And we calculated, in 2022, there were 759 episodes of The Big Game. Yes, we respond to all the events that have happened. And this year we are not slowing down. As for when the next Geneva will be... I think, Alexander, never. Here's my prediction. Because, no such relations with the United States (which we witnessed then in Geneva. - A.G.) are simply impossible. The Americans will not stop, they will support Ukraine as much as possible, until the last Ukrainian who will be ready to fight. It's another matter when the Kiev regime collapses, and that's another matter. For America, this defeat is tantamount to recognizing itself as a paper tiger, a naked king, whatever. The country that lost the global competition is Russia. Not even China. Therefore, for the United States, this issue is indeed also important. Life and death, if you will. Just like for us. The contradiction is fundamental. We just need to defeat this force. Americans, after all, recognize power. But we will have absolutely nothing to talk to them after that. Because I think that, indeed, there can be no return to relations, neither on their part, nor on ours. To be honest, there is no desire to return to some previous relations, to some agreements that will still be violated. - And what date, what month we will win this year, Vyacheslav Alekseevich. - I can't say that. Combat is an extremely unpredictable thing. I have no doubt that we will win. - That our cause is just, Victory will be ours. But now the situation will develop further? I wonder if they will get to the fighters? Or they will limit themselves to tanks. - May well reach the fighters too. Naturally, this will complicate the advancement of our Armed Forces. But, of course, it will not make any fundamental difference. Because - well, how many can they give these fighters? And how many of these fighters are now living in modern combat. - You know the States well. In November 2024, there will be presidential elections. They can somehow influence the situation in Europe and Ukraine. - I don't think so. In America, in fact, elections are always going on. Not presidential, so to Congress. Therefore, the pre-election situation is there all the time. My prediction is that most likely neither Trump nor Biden will be candidates in 2024. Republicans and Democrats will nominate other candidates. But there, both parties will be ready to support Ukraine to the last Ukrainian. Therefore, I do not link the upcoming elections with the cessation of hostilities or support for Ukraine. Indeed, the U.S. can end the conflict simply by ending its support for Ukraine. It's that simple. But will they? Absolutely, in my opinion, no. Although, of course, the financial and political costs for the United States are growing. And this is due not to the elections, but to the difficult, indeed, economic situation. With the fact that now the debt ceiling will have to be raised, that American securities are not in particular demand, that the stock market fell by a quarter last year. That is, they have serious economic problems. And they can't print money indefinitely either. Therefore, there will rather be financial constraints. Plus, the internal problems that exist in the United States itself, they also need to be solved. There are few people who are ready to support Ukraine at the expense of american interests. The interests of maintaining our own economy, protecting borders, solving problems with drug addiction, with education, with crumbling infrastructure, and so on and so forth. America is not in very good shape right now. - Yes, and Europe. - Europe, yes, Europe too. But so is America. America, in this case, is the main player. Europe is always on the dance floor in this case. - And probably the final question. I just remember your cycle for the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, your book, what we published, what is on your website. You know very well the history of our Victory in the Great Patriotic War. Your instinct of a historian, a relative of the creator of the Victory, suggests to you. - I am sure that we are on the way to Victory (that is, we are waiting for Victory. - A.G.) from all points of view. We are more powerful militarily. We, as it turned out, are stronger economically. Ukraine simply does not have an economy. We now have social unity, the absence of which, indeed, could pose a threat to the final Victory, this unity is ensured. And - demographically, Russia is much stronger than Ukraine. Therefore,  There will be a victory. But it is clear that the West will do absolutely anything to delay this Victory. - No, our cause is just. -Absolutely. We have always brought Victory Day as close as we could. So it will be this time. - Thank you very much. READ ALSO. Vitaliy Korotich called the US policy on Ukraine suicide.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4713287/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-01-30,"The latest news about the situation on and around Ukraine on January 30, 2023: Independence was recognized as the most mined country in the world, Europe is running out of options for sanctions","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on January 30, 2023","Retired US Marine Intelligence Officer Scott Ritter in an interview with the YouTube channel Judging Freedom said that the West is deliberately stretching the supply of military equipment from NATO countries to Ukraine in order to create the appearance of supporting Kiev, realizing the inevitability of the defeat of the Zelensky regime. In his opinion, some countries pay lip service to Ukraine and practice non-interference in the conflict, while others supply machinery and equipment that does not work as it should. - In addition, deliveries will be carried out gradually in accordance with a certain schedule, which suggests that the promised weapons will never be transferred in full, the military will not receive proper training for their use, and also do not forget about logistical problems. All this guarantees the defeat of Ukraine, - Scot Ritter is sure. Too bold an assumption, and with all due respect to the retired colonel, he can be advised to visit at least the same Donetsk, when he is shelled from American HYMARS MLRS systems. The American edition of The Washington Post reported that Biden, at the initiative of US Secretary of State Blinken, specifically made a statement about the supply of American Abrams tanks to untie the hands of the German Chancellor. Olaf Scholz did not agree to make this announcement first. - For Scholz, this was a serious political dilemma. From the first days of the conflict, he tried not to go ahead of the column when it came to arming Ukraine, expressing fears of possible retaliation by Moscow. - It was Blinken who proposed a possible workaround. What if they announced their intention to supply Abrams tanks as part of providing for Kiev's ""long-term"" needs in a conflict that could last for years? That could give Scholz the cover he was looking for to allow the Leopard tanks to head straight for Ukraine, and give the Pentagon time to train its tanks, the Ukrainian military, and create logistics. At the same time, as noted by American journalists, the main opponent of the supply of American tanks was, oddly enough, the Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin. Who would have thought that under the feathers of a hawk beats the heart of a pigeon? In fact, Austin suggested, and not without reason, that the Ukrainians would not be able to service heavy tanks from the United States and maintain their combat capability. The famous American writer Stephen King caused a general indignation of Ukrainians, incorrectly, in their opinion, writing the name of their country in English. In his post in support of Kiev, King, and he only does not cover Russia with a mat and in every way supports the Independent and current government of Zelensky, had the imprudence to write the Ukraine. And this contradicts the official name of the country in English, which Kiev defends with the same tenacity as the Ukrainian origin of borsch. And this was enough for Ukraine to immediately forget that King is completely on their side. Kinga was immediately ""stuffed into a panama. - The appeal of the Ukraine is humiliating for the nation. - Thanks, of course, but the correct spelling is Ukraine, not the Ukraine. - Only this is Ukraine (country), not the Ukraine (region). We don't say the England or the Finland – the one refers to a region or several regions united together, for example, the Untied Kingdom,"" wrote the most savvy reader from Independence. As if they all forgot that for a long time Ukraine was one of the republics (region) of the USSR, and many still by inertia write the name of their country with the article. What does this King allow himself? He would have written ""in Ukraine"" instead of ""in"". According to Sky News experts, today's Ukraine has become the most mined country in the world. According to their calculations, now more than 40% of the entire territory of the country is mined. At the same time, military operations are unlikely to have taken place on more than 20% of its area. - The distribution of mines is enormous. This cannot even be compared with Syria or Afghanistan, ""said Katerina Templeton, a representative of the British non-governmental organization Mines Advisory Group. As she emphasized, these were not only anti-tank, anti-personnel mines and booby traps planted in minefields, but also unexploded and cluster munitions scattered across the fields. Did the British count the sea mines? And now they are drifting almost half of the Black Sea, installed by the Navy so that more than half of them were torn off the mines by the first storms. With a sense of deep regret and irreparable loss, the member of the European Commission from Lithuania, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said that the European Union has practically no economic sphere left that has not yet been affected by sanctions against Russia. Therefore, the adoption of new anti-Russian sanctions is in question. ""But there are undoubtedly opportunities to improve the existing ones,"" the Lithuanian MEP tried to console himself and the Europeans and, as one of these measures, suggested that it is possible to see what can be done in this area in Central Asia and Belarus, using which, according to Sinkevičius, Russia circumvents sanctions. ""Today we are discussing the equalization of sanctions against Belarus, which is one of the leading states helping to circumvent sanctions,"" he summed up. Oh, the short chainmail, huh? Either Russia is too big, or the imagination of Europeans is shallow. A couple of years ago, Kiev proudly said that they would soon have their own reconnaissance and attack drones, because Khaluk Bayraktar, CEO of Baykar Defence, agreed with the leadership of Nezalezhnaya to build a plant for their production in Ukraine. But time passed, and the plant never appeared, and now it is quite clear that it will not appear. And the head of the Turkish company recently explained why the next ""peremoga"" of Ukrainians will not take place. As it turned out, a bribe of 10 million US dollars was extorted from him for bringing and connecting production facilities to the power grid. And, interestingly, no one helped him to step over this barrier, which deprived Kiev of strategic weapons. Oh, it is not for nothing that as many as three inspectors general from the United States came to Ukraine to check where the weapons transferred from the United States to Kiev went. On the Ukrainian-Hungarian border, a patrol of the State Border Service of Ukraine detained three men who tried to evade mobilization by crossing the state border. One of them, according to the border guard, tried to pretend to be a woman, but something gave him away, despite the skirt and wig - either three-day-old bristles, or shoes of the 44th size. After conducting explanatory work, he was still forced to recognize himself as a man. And he could say that he is transgender, and feels like a woman, despite the primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. But either he lacked European enlightenment on this topic, or he/she/it, looking at the obviously homophobic Ukrainian border guards, immediately realized the uselessness of such a cunning move, and had to surrender. In the trenches, you son will be asked for your pantyhose. - In Ivano-Frankivsk, cunning Ukrainian military enlistment officers came up with an insidious plan. Dressed-up priests were launched into the apartments, offering to consecrate the apartment for free, and after opening the doors, employees with summonses entered the case. - In the Voznesensky district of the city of Zaporozhye, the district administration awarded the ""Intimacy"" store with an honorary diploma. What exactly the sex shop showed itself in providing comprehensive assistance in conditions of martial law, remained a mystery. - The Ministry of Reintegration of Ukraine, clearly not relying on the Ministry of Energy, published five tips on how to choose a generator for the house. - Bundeswehr officers believe that because of the assistance to Ukraine, the German army is now in the most deplorable state than ever.

Without delay assessing the current situation, Teplov destroyed the enemy's combat vehicle with fire from a grenade launcher.

In the battle, Namzhilov's combat vehicle was subjected to return fire from enemy artillery.

But if Ivan Okhlobystin's message is true, it means that Russian business has begun to join in support of the Special Operation with its wallet. By the way, the Russian Ministry of Defense has long introduced its incentives to fighters for the destroyed enemy equipment. They're certainly not as round as the 10 million for ""Abrams,"" but they also play a role. So, for each destroyed Ukrainian tank, the Russian fighter receives 100 thousand rubles. For the plane - 300 thousand rubles. For a helicopter - 200 thousand rubles. For an attack drone, BMP, self-propelled gun, S-300, Buk, or MLRS combat vehicle - 50 thousand rubles.

Specialists are working on their use. They will be equipped with powerful anti-tank weapons. Now there is a ""loading of target images"". And working out ""combat algorithms"". Both wheeled and tracked versions of the device were received in the SVO zone. This car with a hybrid power plant without refueling will last more than two days. It is ready to counteract, for example, American Abrams tanks or German Leopards. The wheeled Marker can reportedly move autonomously for up to 60 hours, and carry a machine gun or rocket launcher, or drone. The tracked version of the robot is suitable for installing a 12.7-mm Utes machine gun or a block of RPG-26 hand-held anti-tank grenade launchers. The robotic platform is positioned as a constructor for creating models of warfare in the future. The Marker Platform is a joint project of the National Center for the Development of Technologies and Basic Elements of Robotics of the Foundation for Advanced Research and the NGO Android Technics. KP.RU turned to Viktor Litovkin, a military observer and retired colonel, for comment. - You can imagine the real possibilities of the ""Marker"". - Let's test it first in real combat operations, for example, in the SVO zone. - What is a combat robot in the 21st century. - This is a resistant to strong external influences, on a good course on rough terrain autonomous platform. On which an effective and fairly small-sized reconnaissance and combat operation unit is installed. Plus a secure communication unit. In general, the complex of blocks is the most effective configuration. - The complex of this combination of multidirectional equipment is more effective on wheels or on tracks. - We can assume that it is rather on caterpillars. But what is more important is what kind of self-adjustment this system has. What software it has. What are the introductions to specific goals and objectives? This system, the ""Marker"" robot, must instantly inform its operator that it has detected a given target. According to the program, it is obliged to give out the coordinates of the target and its ability to repel the attack per second. And the operator must be able not only to confirm, for example, the defeat, but also to coordinate the rapid departure from the return fire of the target in the event of its non-defeat or in case of a sharp change in tasks. - And than the ground-based Marker, a copter or UAV is better. - Copter is almost always clearly visible to the enemy. And so it's almost always visually vulnerable. And the Marker is moving on the ground. And it potentially cannot be detected until a certain point, before the robot reaches the target. - The Marker can carry many times more combat and reconnaissance equipment than any aerial copter. - Due to its layout- most likely yes. But while it is difficult to say how much more effectively to use it - that's why they are now conducting tests in the Donbass. - The Americans have combat robots that are more effective than ours. - You have to ask the narrow experts. But that's unlikely. - The Marker can be rated more as a scout - or rather as a stormtrooper. - Actually, we have a combat robot ""Uran-9"". It was shown at the Army 2022 exhibition. Who could both fire and conduct reconnaissance. And go one-on-one with the calculation of a zota or pillbox. Yes, the chance of his defeat is quite high. His, this robot, of course, is pathetic. But the man is more pathetic. - Marker has a fairly wide range of equipment that allows you to track the movements of both ground and air targets, and in any weather and at any time of the day. - With such a serious availability of equipment, we can assume both high ""all-weather"" and high vulnerability. But it is even more logical to assume that the developers have invested in good protection of such a expensive combat robot from its detection. At the same time, it is necessary to indicate that the same ""Uranus"" is a ready-made, composed robot that is normally controlled at a certain distance. But the ""Marker"" - according to the data for today - is a platform on which you can hang equipment of almost any direction. And to assemble the equipment in any combination. - That is, such an all-weather ""terminator"" that does not burn in fire and does not sink in water. - This needs to be looked at. Well, we have a tank support combat vehicle (BMPT). She seems to be over 20 years old. There was information that now there are more than a dozen of them on the front line. And is there any information on how effectively they have shown themselves. - The Americans used combat robots. - In Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Syria - with varying degrees of effectiveness. As for the ""Marker"" - it's still ... a thing in itself. The possibilities of which we are not yet really aware of. LISTEN AS WELL.

The artillery of the ""Western"" grouping of troops does not give a break to the 14th and 92nd mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyansk direction in Gryanikovka and Tymkovka of the Kharkiv region and in Novoselovsky in the LPR. The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not count a platoon of fighters, two pickup trucks and a D-20 howitzer. Aviation and artillery of the ""Center"" group of troops in the Krasno-Limansky direction suppressed the forces of the 80th and 95th DShB of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Stelmakhovka and Kuzmino in the LPR and in Torsky in the DPR. The Ukrainians lost a company of fighters there. In the Donetsk direction, the ""Southern"" group hit the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Tonenkoe, Nelepovka and Severny in the DPR. During the day, more than a company of Ukrainian servicemen, a tank, three BMPs, a Msta-B howitzer, a Uragan MLRS, and a French Caesar self-propelled gun ceased to operate here. Units of the Vostok group of troops in the South Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions were harassed by the 72nd Mechanized Brigade and the 35th Brigade of Marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Ugledar in the DPR, as well as the 108th and 124th Brigades of Territorial Defense near Novoselivka and Mirny in the DPR. Losses of the regime per day in these areas exceeded two platoons. Washington is secretly pushing allies to deliver F-16s to Kiev. Helen Cooper and Eric Schmitt, analysts at The New York Times, believe that Washington is pushing a number of NATO allies to supply F-16 fighters to the Kiev regime. As noted by American observers, Joe Biden, who said that his country would not transfer the F-16 to Ukraine, follows the usual scenario. U.S. officials privately acknowledge that such a refusal is temporary. He does not rule out a decision on the supply of fighters later. Well, or make a thick hint to another NATO country about sending an independent American-made F-16. And all this is within the framework of the common tactics of NATO, the United States and Ukraine to resolve the issues of supplying modern weapons to Kiev. When, after months of ""hesitation,"" the Biden administration says yes. And the gates of hell before the new weapons are opened. This has already happened in the case of deliveries to the independent Western BMP, MLRS, air defense systems and, finally, tanks. Well, about the rocket to the moon for Zelensky and Co was said a year ago. Madrid will not send German tanks independently. Europa Press reports that Spain will not transfer Leopard 2A4 tanks to the independent. The reason is weighty: the ""absolutely deplorable condition"" of the armored vehicles once supplied from Germany. According to the publication, these tons of metal for more than ten years rusted on preservation. Today, they need to be restored and modernized. It is curious that the head of the Ministry of Defense of Spain last year warned that she could not transfer tanks to Kiev. Why? Because of their danger to humans. Earlier, the media reported that Madrid was going to give the Kiev regime from four to six Leopard 2A4 tanks. It is not fate that is visible, it is not love that is visible... Three Turkish citizens joined the Sudoplatov battalion. Three fighters from Turkey joined the ranks of the volunteer battalion named after Pavel Sudoplatov, formed in the Zaporozhye region. Now they are crushing the ""enemy"" at the training ground, where the personnel of the unit are trained. A volunteer with the call sign ""Uzun"" said that he came from Turkey ""to support the Russian brothers."" And the main motive: this Turk hates the Nazis who rule Ukraine. When asked what the houses think about participating in the conflict on the side of Russia, a volunteer with the call sign ""Laz"" told TASS that Russia and Turkey have good relations, and his homeland will ""treat well"" its solution. Laz said: ""We know that ukrainians are no longer against us. And that Russia will win this war."" Earlier, the administration of Zaporozhye reported that the soldiers of the Sudoplatov battalion are ready to perform combat missions of any complexity - this allows their previous experience and current training. By the way, the Banderaites were afraid of Sudoplatov like hell incense. Will Zelensky fire his defense minister, Reznikov. Oleksiy Reznikov, the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, can head the Ministry of Justice. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko in his Telegram channel reported that Reznikov could head the Ministry of Justice. The candidacy of the next head of the Ministry of Defense on the evening of February 2 was not called aloud. The ""official"" reasons for the possible removal of Reznikov from the post of head of the defense department were also unknown. Earlier it became known that the SBU accused the former head of the department of public procurement of the Ministry of Defense Bohdan Khmelnitsky of corruption. The reason is contracts for the supply of low-quality body armor. Whether Reznikov could not have known what was happening with supplies to the east to combat units is a rhetorical question. North Korea will participate in the restoration of Donbass. The online newspaper Daily NK from South Korea reports that North Korea will participate in the restoration of Donbass. According to the Seoul edition, Pyongyang declares its readiness to send its construction teams to new Russian regions. And it seems that he has already selected employees to send hundreds of specialists to Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as to Zaporozhye to restore destroyed houses, schools and hospitals. A possible shipment is scheduled for late February - mid-March. The DPRK authorities are ready to send up to half a thousand construction workers in the first batch. As stated, North Korean specialists work very qualitatively and their prices are low - this was also mentioned in the Russian government. A Russian and a Korean are brothers forever. The President of Ukraine demands the release of the ex-president of Georgia. The sixth president of the independent country called on Tbilisi to release the ex-head of the republic Mikheil Saakashvili and ""prevent his execution."" For some reason, Zelensky is sure that Mishiko is ""slowly being killed"" in his historical homeland. So he wrote in social networks: ""Now a citizen of Ukraine, former Georgian President Saakashvili, is slowly being killed. It is shameful that we have to fight against such an attempt at a de facto public execution of a person in Europe in the twenty-first century!"" And for some reason, he called on the Georgian authorities to ""remember their obligations in accordance with European norms for the protection of human rights and stop bullying."" A month and a half ago, Zelensky already called on Tbilisi to send Saakashvili for treatment to Ukraine or another country. Mikheil Saakashvili himself said yesterday that after his death he would like to be buried in Ukraine. Well, here you could go to a meeting and not delay with this. What was wrong with U.S. intelligence in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence has consistently been wrong about Ukraine. This was reported by Politico. In particular, about the capabilities of Ukrainian troops in the framework of hostilities. And this happened from the very beginning of the conflict. Also, the administration of the Ukrainian president was skewed because of the words of the head of the JOINT CHIEFs of Staff of the United States, Mark Milley, that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not be able to ""oust Russian forces"" from all the territories occupied by them. That is, though the eyes are prickly. In Ireland, refugees from the independent live with rats and scum. Irish Independent writes that in Ireland, Ukrainian refugees are forced to live in cramped rooms with rats, without a shower and in the cold. Columnist Rodney Edvars saw that the Ukrainians were settled in a room divided by fragile partitions into cramped rooms. Food is scattered on the floor, the emergency exit is used to stir clothes, there are no showers inside. The journalist writes: ""Ukrainians have to go outside, sometimes in the cold, to wash."" Those who left the country complained about rats and mice in food places. Earlier, the Irish Examiner newspaper wrote that refugees in Ireland are afraid to complain about living conditions because of fears that they could be expelled.

Earlier, the route of the water pipeline was flown around with a working group by Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Timur Ivanov. After the flight, the military stressed that this would be the eighth water pipeline built by the forces of the Ministry of Defense of Russia to provide water to residents of the liberated territories. (Earlier, military builders erected and launched the Chernovsky water pipeline near Debaltseve, in Volnovakha, Rovenki, Dokuchaevsk, a line from the Khanzhenkovsky reservoir to the Seversky Donets canal, and so on).

The grouping of troops ""Center"" in the Krasno-Limansky direction ironed the forces of the 80th and 95th DShB of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Stelmakhovka and Chervona in the LPR and Torsky in the DPR. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there are up to a company. In the Donetsk direction, units of the ""Southern"" grouping of troops destroyed the enemy in Tonenko, Nelepovka and Severny in the DPR. During the day, more than 100 Ukrainian servicemen, one tank, the howitzer ""Msta-B"", the MLRS ""Uragan"" and the French self-propelled gun Caesar were leveled here. In the South-Donetsk and Zaporizhia directions, units of the Vostok group hit the positions of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade and the 35th Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of Ugledar. The local losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine per day are more than two platoons. In Kiev, they again complain about Musk. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the sixth president of Ukraine, mourns the fact that billionaire Musk artificially reduces views of the official pages of the Ukrainian authorities on the social network Twitter. So he wrote: ""Elon Musk, maybe you should stop pessifying Ukrainian official accounts and forcibly reduce their coverage? It's all too obvious."" Podolyak believes that Musk is helping ""Russian propaganda"" in this way, and some kind of regulator is needed that will ""explain to the owner the rules of competition."" The regulator and Valerian are needed for such users who interpret the ""rules of competition"" exclusively in their ineters. Ukrainian oligarchs in Crimea were pinned down. Vladimir Konstantinov, the head of the Crimean parliament, announced the nationalization of property belonging to Kolomoisky and Akhetmov. The latter still owns the boarding house ""Gornyak"", and the first - the organization ""Transport Logistic"". And the former prime minister of independent Yatsenyuk will lose the sky plaza company, known to Crimeans as the Saturn IMAX cinema. And Deputy Shufrichya will cease to be the owner of Estate Holding Group. Nationalization does not imply the closure of enterprises – they will continue to work with the new management and administrations. The profit will remain on the territory of the Russian Federation. Land for peasants, factories for workers, boarding houses for vacationers. Ukrainians are offered to fly on a broomstick, not on the F-1. Polish Deputy Defense Minister Marcin Oczepa said that the provision of self-propelled F-16 fighters is too complicated an event. According to Ochepa, the F-16 is not an assault rifle that can simply be given to someone in their hands. And the training of pilots on this aircraft lasts at least six months in a ""very urgent mode"". In addition, they need the appropriate infrastructure and logistics. Earlier, Politico wrote that the possible dispatch of aircraft to Kiev would turn into a ""logistical nightmare"" for allies, since American F-15 and F-16 fighters need high-quality and long runways, ""which are not in Ukraine."" No, and in the foreseeable future it won't. Therefore, it is better to give them machines - made of plywood. Deserters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are hit by a barrage detachment. According to retired Lieutenant Colonel of the LPR Andriy Marochko, the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to desert from positions in the area of Makiivka in the LPR, but came under fire from the Ukrainian barrage detachment. At least three servicemen were killed. Marochko said that near Makiivka, the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to escape across the Stallion River, but they were discovered by the punishers, a shootout ensued, after the death of several deserters, the rest of the fugitives, dropping blood sweat and tears, returned to their positions. Therefore, you need to run not to ""your own"", but to ""strangers"" - you will be the goal. Gas continues to flow to the West through Ukraine. Sergey Kupriyanov, a representative of Gazprom, said that the pumping of Russian gas through the Sudzha gas measuring station increased by 20% compared to the previous day. On February 1, the volume of supplies amounted to 29.4 million cubic meters. At the same time, Gazprom noted that the application for the Sokhranovka GIS was rejected. Since January 4, the volume of gas supplies to the Old World through the Independent World has not risen above 38 million cubic meters, and since January 19, the volume of supplies has been kept at the level of 24-25 million cubic meters per day. At the same time, it is worth recalling that from February 1, in accordance with the presidential decree, companies that supported the ceiling on prices for Russian gas will not be able to buy it. Basta, karapuziki. ""Mozart"" broke the conductor's baton. The American PMC ""Mozart"", which has been operating in Ukraine since March last year, ceases its activities. The founder of this private campaign, Andy Milburn, said that the last day of the Mozart PMC was held on January 31. He explained: ""The fact that the name and organization were the subject of a lawsuit distracted too much from our core mission: training Ukrainian soldiers and protecting civilians from danger."" Earlier it became known that Milburn and the financial director of the PMC Andrew Bain quarreled over donations. Bain accused the head of a private campaign of misappropriation, embezzlement and mistranslation of donations to Mozart. Well, it's not ""Wagner"" to resist. However, after the name change, the Americans may continue to train the ""warriors of light"". Kolomoisky and Avakov fell under the hands. Zelensky's godfather, billionaire Kolomoisky and former Interior Minister Avakov were searched on February 1. The first was searched in the case of evasion of customs payments and embezzlement of a billion dollars in two oil companies. The second came in the case of the recent helicopter crash in Brovary, when 14 people were killed, including the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Monastyrsky and his deputies. Also, searches were conducted at the deputy and well-known developer Vadym Stolar, who is accused of ""financing terrorism"" and the head of the Kyiv Tax Inspectorate Oksana Datiy, who is associated with illegal VAT refunds from the state budget for UAH 30 billion. Operatives of the SBU and the Bureau of Economic Security also visited officials of the Ministry of Defense and representatives of the military-industrial complex of ukraine.

Recent events suggest that a number of characters from his inner circle are becoming increasingly toxic. For example, when the other day the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU) Andriy Yermak and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny reported by phone on the policy and actions of Independence to Joseph Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and the Chief of the Joint Staffs of the United States, General Mark Milley, they did not invite Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov to this conversation, whose positions were greatly shaken after the resonant scandals about corruption in the military department of Ukraine. Perhaps for the reason that one of the topics of the educational conversation of the Americans with their Ukrainian satellites was precisely the fight against corruption. Apparently, everyone was against putting a publicly infested fox into a chicken coop. There is more and more information and rumors that the Americans want to change Zelensky as head of state to Zaluzhny. At the same time, Zelensky's ""right hand"" Andriy Yermak, as reported from the field, for some time stopped defending Reznikov, for whom zelensky's entire team fought together with his leader, and invited Zaluzhny himself to sit in the chair of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. A rather primitive, although in the opinion of the authors of the combination, a cunning calculation is to stop the scandal with the Ministry of Defense, extinguish the wave of indignation over Reznikov and at the same time introduce Zaluzhny to Zelensky's team to a firing squad, which can only play to reduce the rating of the general, who is beginning to pose a real danger to Zelensky in the struggle for power. Only here Zaluzhny is far from a fool and refused Yermak's offer. But not just like that, but by offering him a number of his candidates who could apply for the current post of Reznikov. The fact that Zelensky's affairs are not really good is evidenced by the revived criticism of his actions in Ukraine itself. Well-known Ukrainian economist and political scientist Oleg Soskin, in general, believes that ""Zelensky has fallen into a trap, and it is time for him to resign."" - The country is actually a complete collapse. To make it clearer at the household level, this is a financial and economic disaster. Since the catastrophe is economic, then what should be done, how can we get out of this situation? There is nowhere to buy weapons, they are not produced and they must be taken somewhere. There is nowhere to take it, - he lists the unenviable position of Ukraine article by article. - There is no money, there is no finance, there is no budget. What to do, explain to me who to rely on? Only for external assistance - weapons and all other things should be given. Can they give? No. For example, now came the information - Biden said that he would not give F-16 aircraft. - On the other hand, it takes 35 months to train a pilot. 35 months is, my dear, three years. On the other hand, our pilots say that there is no longer the strength to fly on this old one, they cannot do anything, so the best pilots are dying, we will soon have no pilots at all. That's the situation we have with that. That is, Western weapons, until they come, even the same Leopards - this is the month of March. And two or three months how to hold? – Soskin continues to list and comes to a disappointing conclusion for Kiev and Zelensky. - Zelensky is actually in a trap. Yermak, him, and this whole group of them. And the trap shrinks externally and internally. Therefore, make assault brigades, do not do, Zelensky, they will not help you, nothing will help. In principle, everything goes to the fact that it is necessary to begin impeachment proceedings in the Supreme Council, if Zelensky does not agree in the near future to resign himself or take some other steps. Just like in the writhing Third Reich, in which Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz became Adolf Hitler's successor. Zelensky does not want Zaluzhny as Dönitz. And in this trap Zelensky drove both himself and the whole of Ukraine himself, with his own hands. And we can't talk about his voluntary withdrawal anymore. Since he cannot win, which is becoming increasingly obvious to the West, he will have to be sacrificed. Even if the Americans decide to change him to Zaluzhny, then with a very high probability the general will come to the already vacant seat. It remains only to choose what it will be - a plane crash, poisoning, ambush of the ""Russian special forces"" or something else intricate. At the same time, Moscow does not need a dead Zelensky, we really need him alive, because he knows a lot and, ideally, should give detailed testimony at the trial, begging himself not for life imprisonment, but for a specific term or at least the hope of pardoning him after 25 years in prison. But that is why he, in this capacity, is categorically dangerous for Americans. LISTEN AS WELL. Ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to 150 kilometers (more)"

The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who arrived on the eve of the EU-Ukraine summit, visited one of the branches of Ukrposhta together with the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal to see how local residents change their old incandescent lamps for new ones supplied from the EU. And it was at this moment that an air raid alert was announced in Kiev. And Ursula, you can imagine, together with Denis had to hide in a bomb shelter at the post office. And this is despite the fact that not a single missile and bomb strike by the Russian military was carried out on any object in Kiev on this day. Nothing reminiscent? Well, on May 9, 2022, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, arrived in Odessa for talks with Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal. And Shmygal also took him to the bomb shelter as soon as the air raid alarm sounded in Odessa. Two strange coincidences at once - the same Shmygal, and in the same way not a single strike on Odessa that day. The bomb shelter, however, is different, but this only proves once again that Russia ""spoils the lives of Ukrainians"" throughout its territory. The usual psychological impact on not very developed and not the most intelligent characters. Thus, Ursula was brought to the summit in the proper psychological state. Had she been a psychologist by training, she probably would have been told that she had been ""played. But Zelensky literally stunned everyone, first of all, of course, Ukrainians at the press conference after the negotiations. To begin with, he said that ""the morale of Ukrainians has recently weakened,"" but earlier, they say, ""he was stronger."" And all because residents of some cities now think ""that they are on vacation,"" and personally Zelensky ""believes that this is a weakness."" After that, he moved on to his usual business - promises and extortion with hints. - No one will hand over Bakhmut. We will fight as hard as we can. We consider Bakhmut to be our fortress. We consider our heroes, who unfortunately died there, to be heroes,"" the President of Ukraine said pathetically, but immediately remembered his main function of begging for weapons and money and continued. - If the supply of weapons, namely long-range weapons, is accelerated, then we will not only not leave Bakhmut, we will begin the de-occupation of Donbass. Given that according to information from Kiev, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Zaluzhny, who has been asking permission from Zelensky for a week to withdraw the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Artemivsk (Bakhmut), we can say that Zelensky finally refused the commander and took responsibility for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city on himself. A little later, Zelensky's position on the situation in this upcoming cauldron for the Armed Forces of Ukraine was deciphered by the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Misha Podolyak. Moreover, it turned out to be extremely cynical for him. - It's not about 10% of the population, but about our territory, in our homes. We are also afraid, of course, and pay a very high price for the protection of Bakhmut. But we can't leave that behind. It shows who we are, and it should be clearly understood in Europe. Our young people give their lives for the right to live in our homes. Bakhmut is not just a place, it's our home,"" he said in an interview, answering the question of whether it is worth keeping a city in which only 10% of the population remains. But he again refused to name the number of losses in this direction. - As for human casualties, I can't answer you now. We will be able to name this figure when everything is over,"" Podolyak announced. Strictly speaking, ""these figures"" will certainly be named, only not by its current rulers who fled from Ukraine, but by the real winners in this conflict. As for Zelensky and Podolyak, with these words they only once again confirmed that they do not care about the population, about the civilians of Ukrainian cities, and the only thing that worries them is the territories under their control. P.S. By the way, the degree of confidence of local leaders in Ukraine in their president is perfectly illustrated by the fact that, despite Zelensky's promise not to surrender Bakhmut, the mayor of Sloviansk (also quite an odious person, but who retained at least the remnants of sanity) called on the population of the city to evacuate in connection with the ""approach of the front.""

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4716008/,Victor BARANETS,2023-02-03,"The United States will supply Ukraine with ""smart"" long-range shells: what is their danger and does Russia have an ""antidote""",Bloomberg: THE UNITED STATES will send long-range GLSDB shells to Ukraine within nine months,"In recent days, the Ukrainian and Western press have been ""fanning the censer"" in connection with reports that the United States is preparing to supply Kiev with glSDB hybrid long-range shells. Bloomberg wrote that according to its sources, these miracle munitions will appear in Ukraine within nine months. Well, what kind of beasts are glSDB and how can they affect the situation on the battlefield? What should the Russian army be prepared for? Or in other words, what and how will this scourge be repelled? Let's try to figure it out. Let's start with the edge: why these munitions are coded by the acronym GLSDB. It's simple - these are the initial letters of the complex term Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb. Which translates as a small diameter land-based bomb. It was created by the American corporation Boeing together with the Swedish manufacturer Saab AB. It was based on the American-made GBU-39 aircraft guided bomb, which has its own navigation system, as well as special folding wings - the so-called planning modules. To create a fundamentally new ammunition, this ""smart"" bomb was literally crossed with the propulsion system of a rocket. And it can be launched using the M142 HIMARS and M270 multiple launch rocket launchers, which, by the way, were already received by the Ukrainian army last year. And they are being used against Russian troops and civilians in the cities of Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye. Here the Americans clearly had an economic calculation - there is no need to spend money on the creation of new special launchers. The main thing is this: GLSDB can become the most long-range ammunition of the Ukrainian army. It will be able to hit targets at a distance of 150 km with a deviation of only 1 meter (if, of course, you take the word of its creators). If this happens, then the entire territory that the Russian army controls today in the DPR, LPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions will be under the gun. Also under the threat of shelling will be the northern Crimea and the border regions with Ukraine - Belgorod, Rostov, Bryansk and Kursk ... Well, how does GLSDB ""work""? Now you will understand why the projectile was called ""smart"". Its launch is carried out along a ballistic trajectory, after launch, the munition is climbed to the maximum height, and then begins to plan for the enemy's object. Moreover, the projectile can hit targets in any direction, even the opposite of the launch. On the final trajectory, the munition can adjust the direction of flight, which allows it to be effectively used to destroy hard-to-reach targets, for example, hidden behind hills or multi-storey buildings. Before the explosion, the projectile usually falls steeply downwards. The explosion can also be carried out over the target to defeat infantry, with a direct hit to destroy armored vehicles or with a delay - this method is used to break through shelters. The warhead of the GLSDB is 16 kg. Diameter is 19 cm. Length is 180 cm. Here you need to know that the price of GLSDB consists of the cost of the already mentioned GBU-39 bomb, used as a warhead, (this is $ 40,000), the cost of a rocket engine ($ 160,000) and the cost of assembly work (and this is not less than $ 30,000). It comes out together with $200,000 -$250,000 per unit. And do you think that the tens of thousands of GLSDB already promised to Kiev will be given ""for so""? There are no fools in the White House or the Pentagon. For all these ammunition (as well as for other weapons and military equipment), Zelensky and his government (or rather, the people of Ukraine) will have to pay. No money? No problem! Washington has already come up with a great barter: Kiev will be paid by more furry enterprises, mines (say, with reserves of titanium and uranium ore), explored underground gas ""lakes"" and even giant fat black earth expanses. Oh well, let the fooled Ukrainians have a headache about it. And for us, a new ""headache"" is much more important - how we will fight this new scourge in the form of GLSDB. The thing is serious. I will try to reassure my fellow citizens: the antidote for such weapons, apparently, should be a modified version of the Pantsirya-SM complex. After refinement (taking into account the combat experience already gained in Ukraine), it was able to deal with various types of complex targets, including small-sized guided bombs. How it will actually be - SVO will show. Although our army has other ways to avoid ""trouble"" from GLSDB - to destroy the American launchers HIMARS and M270 (from which the ammunition will be launched) immediately after the appearance on the territory of Ukraine. And, of course, beat the warehouses with GLSDB. The inevitable question is: Do we have something like this? Eat. This is a whole brood of high-precision guided munitions ""Krasnopol"", ""Kitolov"", ""Gran"" and others. The Krasnopol guided projectile, for example, has a semi-active laser homing head. Designed to defeat stationary and moving armored and unarmored targets and engineering structures at a distance of up to 25 km, and with the first shot. ""Edge"" and ""Kitolov"" also ensure the defeat of not only stationary, but also moving targets with the first shot, without additional shooting. But we must admit that all these our high-precision shells, although they hit the enemy with snipers, are still much inferior to the American GLSDB in terms of target range. Our design bureaus and research institutes are now working on this. In the meantime, we are more than parrying the glSDB capabilities with other ""instruments"" - high-precision Kalibr, Kinzhal, Iskander missiles and X-55 aircraft missiles. And they hit not 150 or 160 kilometers, but 2.5 thousand or more ... LISTEN AS WELL. Colonel Baranets: The United States is preparing Ukraine for a general battle in the spring (more)"

The topic of the meeting: the provision of a new aid package to Ukraine in the amount of 14 to 16 billion dollars.

The IMF official noted that ""the organization is interacting with the Ukrainian authorities and hopes to move to a fully prepared program as soon as possible."" Well, in general, yes, it is worth hurrying and sawing. William Burns, the head of the CIA, said the next six months would be ""critical"" in the conflict in Ukraine. According to the director of the CIA, Moscow in the situation in Ukraine relies on the ""political fatigue"" of the West. At the same time, according to Burns, Washington does not believe that Russia is ""serious about negotiating a settlement,"" and even advises to sacrifice Artemovsky (Bakhmut) at the current stage - in anticipation of Western tanks and a ""decisive counteroffensive"" in the spring. Well, then the streams will ring and starlings will bring good news, but not to the right bank of the Dnieper. Andrei Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel of the LPR, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine liquidated colleagues who decided to surrender in the Kremennaya district in the LPR. A unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine hung a white flag and asked the command for permission to surrender. On the Russian side, the fire ceased. But from the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, an artillery strike was delivered and a dense rifle fire began on the ""traitors"". Who died. Prior to that, the soldiers of our 237th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment in the Kremennaya area captured the Ukrainian military, who were trained by instructors from Georgia and France. In general, you need to give up quickly, with hindsight and wisely. The Chinese edition of the South China Morning Post reports that the supply of Western weapons to the Ukrainian authorities can turn into an endless cycle of violence and bloodshed not only in Europe, but also beyond its borders. Columnist Mariam Shah believes that there is already enough evidence that Western weapons from the independent market are going to the black markets and spreading around the world. And this becomes the cause of a new arms race. The policy of pumping Ukraine with weapons, according to the author of the article, will entail numerous human casualties and destruction, and will cause a new incitement of protracted conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. Someone else has pain doubts. Bloomberg reports that the high-precision long-range munitions GLSDB (Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb), developed by Boeing, will not be deployed in self-propelled in the near future. Deliveries, according to the publication, will go to the independent no earlier than in nine months. The GLSDB is a combination of the GBU-39 high-precision guided bomb and rocket engine. Projectiles can be launched, for example, from the Heimars MLRS. Their range exceeds 150 kilometers. Kiev is waiting — and waiting. Polish peasants protest against the import of Ukrainian grain into the country. Local farmers declare the risk of ruin due to the difference in the cost of raw materials from the neighboring country with Polish agricultural products. They have already blocked checkpoints on the border with Ukraine, protesting against the import of wheat. And a number of Polish organizations uniting farmers also protested, since agricultural products are imported into the country, which are not exported, although they were originally intended for this. The farmers themselves call the grain from the independent low-quality. Yes, tell me directly - Ukraine supplies shit. Josep Borrell, the head of the EU foreign policy service, admitted in an interview with DerStandard that in January 2022 he could hardly answer the question of whether the European Union is ready to provide military assistance to Kiev. Borrell said that then the Prime Minister of Ukraine Shmygal asked whether the European Union is ready to give Kiev ""the weapons necessary for defense."" And a senior European official admitted: ""I wasn't sure how to respond because I didn't know how strong Europe's resolve would be. But today I can easily find the answer."" And he said that today the total volume of military, humanitarian and macro-financial support provided to Ukraine by the EU amounted to € 50 billion, while more than 15% fall on military assistance.

As announced by the head of the State Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov, about 500 different real estate objects and enterprises owned by foreigners who conduct anti-Russian activities, including support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Kiev regime, will become the property of the republic this time.

Then about 130 objects owned by Ukrainian oligarchs and politicians were nationalized. The latter, earning in the Russian Crimea, did not hesitate to spend the profits on Ukrainian militants.

Until November last year, it was managed directly from Kiev, where the net profit went (about 165 million rubles for 2021). At the same time, a number of managers appointed by Ukrainian oligarchs did not hide their pro-Ukrainian positions, and after the terrorist attack on the Crimean bridge, to the indignation of the factory workers, the plant administration refused to allocate concrete and cement for its restoration. The Crimean authorities promised not to stop there. ""We are working in this direction,"" the head of the State Council of Crimea, Vladimir Konstantinov, said in an interview with Komsomolka at the time. - The Anti-Terrorism Commission reveals the ownership of property.

Some names of those who will soon lose property in the Crimea, voiced on his page in social networks Vladimir Konstantinov. So. - Oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. In Crimea, he owns several enterprises that are part of Ukrainian companies, as well as the Gornyak boarding house. - Ukrainian oligarch and politician Nestor Shufrich, who owns Estate Holding Group through his relatives. Last year it became known that this company has real estate and a land plot in the village of Simeiz. According to some reports, the Simferopol Pasta Factory is also listed as Shufrich's company. - The sponsor of the Maidan and a notorious Russophobe, the former head of the Dnipropetrovsk region Igor Kolomoisky, together with his daughter Angelica, will remain without Transport Logistic LLC and Envil LLC. - A point will be made in relation to the saturn IMAX cinema (Sky Plaza LLC). The authorities have repeatedly said that through dummies it is owned by the Maidan ex-prime minister of the ""independent"" Arseniy Yatsenyuk. - Billionaire Sergey Taruta says goodbye to the Alma Building Materials Plant (engaged in the extraction of decorative and building stone). - Lithuanian citizen Kolas Igoris, who owns the villa ""Elena"" in Yalta. - Rafik Dau Boulos, a Lebanese businessman and partner of oligarch Akhmetov, will lose his enterprise JSC Stroydetal in Feodosia. In addition, villas, factories, as well as the property of 12 Ukrainian banks, which, although they left the Crimea, but left behind offices, warehouses, shops, land plots and hotels, will be subject to nationalization. The decision on the nationalization of this property in the coming days will be made by deputies of the State Council of Crimea. - From a moral point of view, it is important for us to stop the activities of such founders, - commented Vladimir Konstantinov. - This does not mean the closure of enterprises. Previously nationalized enterprises continue to work, they do not have any problems. The leadership staff was replaced by them, temporary administrations were introduced. Then the procedure for their privatization will be carried out, and they will work in the legislative field of Russia, leaving profits on the territory of our country and directing it to support the participants of the special operation, for the benefit of our people.

Unlike the yellow ""Star of David"", which was ordered by Hitler's Nazis to be worn by Jews in the Third Reich.","We all remember these Western incantations that ""there is no Nazism in Ukraine, because they have a Jewish president."" Strange are these people, Western ladies and gentlemen, who believe that Nazism is the persecution of only and exclusively Jews and repression exclusively against representatives of this nation. Meanwhile, Russians in Ukraine have long been such ""Jews of the 21st century,"" and the only difference from the Third Reich of the Fourth Under-Church is that for Russians and those whose sympathies are on the side of Russia, concentration camps with perimeter towers and service shepherds trained to tear up human flesh and their extermination industry – gas chambers – have not yet been set up.  However, if Zelensky and his team remain in power, this will not last long. The infamous Galician children's writer Larisa Nitsoy proposed to oblige everyone who sympathizes with Russia to sew red stars on their clothes and appear everywhere in this form. And how is this different from the Nazi ""Stars of David"", which the Nazis obliged the Jews to wear! The number of rays, the fact that there are five of them, not six – and the color: not a yellow star, but a red one? But as for other differences, somehow nothing is visible at all. Associations are too transparent, and even Nitsa herself sees them and tries to justify herself. - This is not segregation, and we are not fascist Germany. People just have to understand who is in front of them,"" she said, but immediately refuted herself. - Support the Russians - wear a red star on your clothes. If you go against society, against your people, then you must be designated. Decent establishments should not allow such, whether it is hairdressers, gas stations or cinemas. Let them feel like outcasts. Do not let people with stars on their clothes in hairdressers, restaurants, cinemas, gas stations. Let me tell you, because in Hitler's Reich everything was just like that with the Jews. It was in such places that they were not allowed, as well as in transport. And ordinary Germans were afraid to talk to people with stars on their clothes, so as not to fall into the category of first ""suspicious"", and then - and among the enemies of the nation. And there and in the concentration camp with things and with the same star is just around the corner. And needless to say, these are all crazy aunts Nitsoy and Farion who carry nonsense on their own. For example, the former head of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine, General Valeriy Kondratyuk, demands on the air of radio ""NV"" toughening repressions against Russians in Ukraine, testing everyone on polygraphs and life sentences for those who are ""suspected of collaborating with the Russians."" They will not prove it, but only suspect it. Or new variations of the old solo performed by Irina Farion's witchbaba (or babovedema), which demands to exclude any mention of the Russian language from everywhere, up to the Ukrainian Constitution. No minorities in Ukraine – Farion raises the question with the edge of his palm and demands to adopt a law to ""clearly write in this law that the Moscow language in Ukraine is the language of the occupier, it is not the language of national ""lessness"", the Muscovites are not a minority or a ""lesser"", they are occupiers, at least since 1659, when the first military garrisons appeared on our holy Ukrainian territories."" So we do not need to broadcast here about ""wretched crazy aunts"", especially since all their wishes that they expressed have already become or are becoming a Ukrainian reality. It is especially noteworthy that all these statements poured in at a time when eu high representatives came to Kiev to hold the EU-Ukraine summit and discuss how to protect ""Ukrainian democracy from Russian totalitarianism."" At the same time, the Network and the media discussed for a long time and washed the bones of face control at this event: what costumes and dresses should be, and what colors. But there should be only one criterion - sew yourself a red star or a yellow ""Star of David"" on your clothes and go. You want to go to the summit, or you can go to the concentration camp. After all, are you better than the Russians? Or you're Nazis yourself. LISTEN AS WELL. Ukraine can get ammunition with a range of up to 150 kilometers (more)"

And they know a lot about it - after the end of all wars and conflicts, from 6 to 8 million such mines and explosive devices remain on the territory of this country. This made Cambodia a world leader in mine pollution. But now the palm of primacy, along with the leaves and roots, has been torn from the Cambodians by Ukraine. More than 40% of the territory of Ukraine is considered mined. This is a world record, said on the air of the British channel Sky News the representative of the organization, which is engaged in helping people affected by unexploded ordnance, Catherine Templeton. ""It's not comparable to Syria and Afghanistan. It's really big,"" she says, mentioning that half the country is littered with anti-tank, anti-personnel mines, booby traps and cluster munitions. ""You can find everything imaginable in Ukraine."" And she adds that her organization doesn't focus on who put it all in. Though it would be worthwhile. In 2005, Ukraine ratified the agreement on the non-use of anti-personnel mines, known as the Ottawa Treaty. Only the warehouses were not emptied. As of 2011, its arsenal was 6.7 million pieces. That is, a mine for every six inhabitants of the country. According to the UN, now only half of what was scattered on the fields. The rest is still in Ukrainian warehouses. The American NGO Human Rights Watch (for human rights- ed.) also spoke about this topic. Of course, after all the anti-Russian squeezes and jumps, she published an article about the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Oh My God!) uses banned anti-personnel mines ""Petal"". He says that ""three such cases have been recorded."" And all these three cases (you will not believe it!) are chaotic scattering of ""petals"" on the territory of the DPR, LPR and in all other areas where hostilities are taking place. The Ukrainians scattered them in the battles of Yakovlevka and Soledar, now - at Ugledar and Izyum. Even the electoral HRW believes that laying thousands of such mines in Izyum and its environs is too much. They confirm 11 civilian casualties (which, come on, is unprecedented). ""I think, without a doubt, this is the most serious violation of the mine ban treaty in its 25 years of existence,"" said Stephen Goose, executive director of the organization's weapons division. For the first time, the mass use of ""petals"" by the APU was discussed in mid-March 2022. They were scattered in the villages on the frontline with the help of cluster shells mlrs ""Uragan"", carrying 312 mines. Seeing this for the first time, residents of the city tried to neutralize them by throwing bricks and old tires at them, and the most naïve – even collecting them in a plastic bag ""to show at work."" I wonder what the Europeans would say if anti-personnel mines rained down from the air by the thousands to Marseille, Naples or Amsterdam, equal in size to Donetsk. Small plastic ""petals"" fly in the air and plan to the ground, merging with sand and foliage. It is not easy to detect them, and if you step on, they tear off the foot. Scattering them in settlements, the main victims are peaceful people, including children playing on the street. War with the unarmed, or rather terror, is a common tactic of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Soviet troops also used ""Petals"" in Afghanistan to block the mujahideen offensive. Their peculiarity was that after two days they triggered the mechanism of self-destruction, and after the end of hostilities they were not dangerous. However, the basic modification of the PFM-1, which ukrainians now use, does not have this mechanism, and the ""petals"" will remain in the dust forever, tearing off the legs of random passers-by. We are not talking about frog mines, stretch marks, monks and other dangerous things that will cripple the lives of entire generations of children and adults. If using only half of the stock of their mines, the Ukrainian authorities managed to pollute 40% of the territory, then what will happen when they use the entire stock. LISTEN AS WELL.

There were still difficult 2.5 years ahead, but in February 1943 it became clear: we would win. Where is that second Stalingrad, the line beyond which the turning point will come, I am often asked. Unfortunately, there is no answer to this question now. But sooner or later it will happen at some point, and this turning point will affect not only the enemy, but also his allies. 80 years ago, as a result of the Battle of Stalingrad, Turkey refused to invade the Soviet Union, and Japan changed its mind about going on a Siberian campaign. Romania, Italy and Hungary, whose contingents were also defeated at Stalingrad, rushed to conclude a separate peace with Great Britain and the United States. Someday, we will get to a point where the Ukrainian ""allies"" will begin to look for an opportunity to step aside, to pretend that they did not participate in this. There are tactical victories, we can show the same dedication as our ancestors 80 years ago, but in terms of the scale of the battle and its consequences, we have not yet had such events. Although today the operational initiative is in the hands of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. In the Artyomovsk direction, we show good progress, we took the small village of Sacco and Vanzetti, named after anarchist workers. I do not understand the laughter around this village, they say, three houses, according to the last census - 3 inhabitants. Actually, they did not liberate a populated area, but suppressed the enemy's fortified defensive point, which stands on the way to more serious tasks. And we will have hundreds, if not thousands, of such small villages on this difficult path, and each plays its part in the future victory. Within a week, serious progress was made at the Svatovsky Frontier. This is now one of the hottest spots. And we must understand that during the previous week, the enemy tried to break through our defenses on almost the entire contact line. We withstood this, and were able, seizing the initiative, to go forward. We advanced in one place 300 meters ahead, in another - 700. This is very hard assault work that is being done (and I want to emphasize this especially) by the mobilized. Fighting continues on the outskirts of Seversk, the encirclement of Artemovsk and its cutting off from The Hours of Yar is being formed. In fact, now our forces are pulling apart the enemy's reserves and methodically grinding them down. Someday, all these events will be included in the history books, as they are already talking about today. Although, in my opinion, it is too early for this, it is already clear that the interpretation should be unambiguous: ""Russia is right in this conflict."" A special military operation was launched, because otherwise the fighting would now be on the Crimean peninsula. At the beginning of February 2022, and I arrived in Donetsk exactly a year ago, a powerful offensive grouping of Ukrainian troops was assembled around the Donbass. All this armada was ready, on the first order, to launch an offensive into the Donbass, and then, I am sure, into the Crimea. Today, Berlin and Paris say that the Minsk agreements were a fiction. They were simply preparing to militarily regain the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and then the Crimea. Therefore, the interpretation in such a textbook should be unambiguous. We started SVO out of necessity. And it was not Ukraine that launched battle formations against us, but the collective West, which set the goal of destroying our statehood. Last week, it became clear that deliveries of at least tanks to Ukraine are very, very stretched in time and space. First, they are coming, because the Soviet equipment that was in service with Ukraine has been destroyed. We burned it. Secondly, german tanks will not arrive until 2 months later. American Abrams - not earlier than the end of the year. Incoming vehicles will immediately rush into battle in areas that are especially in need of this, like Svatovsky Frontier, Bakhmut (Artemovsk), Chasov Yar - soon. Therefore, tank assistance, in my opinion, in the information space is greatly exaggerated. If these are portioned deliveries that will be immediately sent to the front, respectively, they will be immediately burned there. But in addition to tanks, there is artillery. It is necessary to develop counter-battery warfare, which we still do not have at the level that the enemy has. You need to suppress air defenses to hit the rear. Every program I'm asked this question: Why don't we hit the rear? Because air defense is not suppressed, because aviation cannot work in those places. By the way, there was a lot of talk this week about the supply of F-16s, they say, the Americans brushed it off, they say: we will not send fighters to Kiev. But this does not mean that Ukraine will not have them. It's just that other countries will put them in, and the Americans will still make money on it. Let's say the Netherlands hands over its F-16s to Ukraine, and the U.S. sells them more modern F-35s. And the Dutch will be satisfied, and the Americans in earning, and the Ukrainians seem to have something there. The F-16 is not new machines, but it is not inferior to the models that were, among other things, in service with Ukraine. Only in 11 months of the conflict there were several dozen air duels in the zone of a special military operation and Ukraine did not win any of them. That is, the level of training of our pilots is still higher, and I do not know how the situation will change, relatively speaking, 30 F-16 fighters against our group, which has ... I won't say how many, but these are still three-digit figures. Equipping with fighters requires retraining of pilots, their supply entails logistical problems, repairs, basing. Yes, these are all solvable barriers. But if the same Su-35 comes out against the F16, the comparison will not be in favor of the American fighter. They ask what we can do against the new missiles for the Highmars, the delivery of which has been announced. On the one hand, they are two times less powerful than those we have already encountered, on the other hand, they are much cheaper, but on the third hand, a glide projectile is quite a convenient target for such means of our air defense as ""Pantsir"" or ""Thor"". The whole question is in the tactics of use and the number of munitions launched. And we have all the opportunities to intercept new shells. Here a colleague complained, saying that the sharpness of perception of what is happening in the zone of the special operation has dulled over the year. And to me, on the contrary, it seems that at the initial stage this sharpness was not enough. Not everyone understood what was happening, that this was not distant and alien, but ours, native, and there for us, for our state, for our right to exist further as a nation, the same people as our neighbors on the porch or in the stairwell are fighting. I remember how in June I returned from a 100-day business trip, and in the same Moscow, fed, sleek, nothing reminded me that just 12 hours away by car there was a massacre. And then portraits of heroes began to appear, maybe they are also a little familiar now, but they should be. And the streets of our heroes should be, and in textbooks they will have to be written about. The acuity of perception has not disappeared, it is just that it may not spill out into the public space. It is clear that when there are no serious successes, when there is no large-scale promotion, all this is a little boring, perhaps, for those people who have nothing to do with the SVO ... But there are few of them after mobilization. The more positive events there are, the higher the acuity of perception will be. And there will definitely be such events. LISTEN AS WELL.

During the interrogation that took place in Donetsk in the presence of a cameraman from RIA Novosti, Simbirsky said that in Novopyatryakovka a column of the Armed Forces of Ukraine collided with a column of the Russian military. In that fleeting battle that happened back in March 2022, Ukrainian soldiers were defeated, and the survivors fled to the village.

And, it seems, they have already begun to apply them. Even Hitler in the Great Patriotic War did not dare to do this.","A month ago, a Ukrainian video was posted on the social network with strange, homemade ammunition for dropping from quadcopters. The author seemed to hint: ""Hold on, Moskali, you all khana."" The video did not produce the desired effect, therefore, they decided to repeat the stuffing last Sunday - February 5. These shootings were posted by the famous Ukrainian right-winger* Yuriy Magyar. This time he showed dozens of homemade containers in a freezer under the Ukrainian flag. Experts immediately assumed that their filling was cyanogen chloride. At a temperature of minus 7 degrees, it goes from a gaseous state to a solid one, so it is safer to store such homemade ammunition. According to the Nazi, these containers are designed to be dropped on the positions of Russian fighters completing the encirclement of Bakhmut (Artemovsk). The situation of Ukrainian troops in this city is critical. Perhaps that is why the Nazis decided to show this ""weapon of last chance for scoundrels."" Without delving into chemistry, cyanogen chloride is one of the closest ""relatives"" of hydrocyanic acid, only heavier than air, creeps on the ground, crawls into shelters. It is used in the production of herbicides in huge volumes (transported by railway tankers!) and in the Ukrainian chaos it is easy to get it, which we demonstrated clearly. At the same time, since January, our fighters at the front began to note the strange consequences of ordinary droppings of ammunition from quadrocopters on our positions - burning in the nasopharynx, headaches, nausea. All this indirectly confirmed the use of cyanogen chloride. Moreover, it even fell on downed enemy quadcopters and when they were selected for study, the toxic effect was felt. Here are the symptoms of cyanogen chloride poisoning, similar to exposure to hydrocyanic acid. ""The affected person screams, loses consciousness and falls.

After a few breaths, breathing stops. Blood pressure drops sharply. The pulse is reduced, thread-like."" Gas masks help, but not all and not always. Antidotes, most likely, will not be in the sanitary medicine cabinet. The enemy chose the poison tastefully, thoughtfully. Of course, such use of toxic substances will not bring any victory to Ukraine. ""Superweapon"" does not bring victories at all, motivated infantry wins under competent leadership. It is strange to realize, but Hitler, who had no morality at all, did not dare to use toxic substances in the Great Patriotic War. Perhaps because he himself was involved in gas attacks during the First World War. And ours, especially, did not use these dastardly weapons. Although, everyone was preparing, considering such a possibility: wearing gas masks, anti-hasten capes and special antidotes was mandatory on both sides of the front. The Germans had a whole line of chemical munitions at the front. For example, mortar mines marked HB or the so-called ""blendcorpergranaten"", but they were equipped with smoke compounds or an unpleasant, but harmless (in comparison) ""tear gas"" - chloracetophenone. It is clear that at any time, the filling of ammunition could be replaced. Ours were engaged in the development of fire mixtures - for their use there were so-called ""ampulomets"" and ""sharomets"" at the front, which produce glass ammunition. But no one dared to use combat poison gases then. But the Ukrainians did. In this story, the deliberate demonstration of a new ""superweapon"", which, by the way, is prohibited by all possible conventions, attracts itself. And the second point is the silence of the West. There are two assumptions here. Or the Ukrainians are convinced that they will not be anything even for such a crime. It would be Russia that would be nailed, declared a fiend of hell, adding new sanctions to it, and Kiev with some other heavy weapons. And Ukraine can do anything: burn, do not be shy. Or the second option - this provocation is coordinated and thought out. It is not the personal initiative of the degenerate Magyar and his brothers. They are trying to bring Russia to the retaliatory use of unconventional means of warfare. What for? To scroll the flywheel of the conflict one more turn. * The Right Sector is an extremist organization of Ukrainian nationalists banned in Russia. ""THERE ARE FACTS OF APPLICATION. "" According to the statements of our units, this is not only in the Artyomovsk direction, but also in the Ugledarsk direction, there are facts of the use of chemical compounds that cause malaise in our servicemen.

Starting the work, the head of the military department congratulated all participants on the liberation by our troops from the mercenaries of the Kiev regime solidar, Kleshcheevka, Podgorne, Krasnopillya, Blagodatne, Lobkove and Nikolaevka. ""Currently, hostilities are successfully developing in the areas of Ugledar and Artemovsk,"" Shoigu said. Further, the head of the military department pointed out that the United States and its allies ""are trying to prolong the conflict in the SVO zone as much as possible."" ""To do this, they have begun to supply heavy offensive weapons, openly call on Ukraine to seize our territories. In fact, such steps draw NATO countries into the conflict and can lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation,"" the minister warned. At the same time, he noted that the groups of our troops continue to ""successfully grind"" all the weapons and equipment supplied to Kiev, both on the routes of its delivery and in combat positions. ""Despite unprecedented military assistance from Western countries, the enemy suffers significant losses. Only in the first month of this year, they amounted to more than 6500 servicemen, 26 aircraft, 7 helicopters, 208 unmanned aerial vehicles, 341 tanks and other armored fighting vehicles, 40 combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems, ""Shoigu listed, while drawing attention to the fact that the Ukrainian leadership, realizing that it will not be possible to defeat Russia by military means, continues to resort to criminal actions: they shell civilians,  commit terrorist attacks. Shoigu called all these crimes ""genocide of the Ukrainian population by the Kiev regime."" The minister recalled the ""barbaric essence of the Ukrainian leadership"", which refused to cease fire even during the Orthodox Christmas. On the contrary, Ukrainian nationalists fired more than 550 mortar and artillery attacks that day. At the same time, Ukrainian artillery was suppressed by the return fire of Russian troops. In the thematic part, the Minister proposed to discuss the issue of re-equipment of the orbital grouping of military spacecraft. ""As part of the solution of this problem, the Lavochkin Scientific and Production Association is developing and creating a satellite system for all-weather remote sensing of the Earth. The data obtained will contribute to improving the effectiveness of the use of troops. Today we will consider the progress of development work and determine the main deadlines for its implementation,"" Shoigu suggested. The minister also planned to sum up the interim results of the reconstruction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline, where, on behalf of the President of Russia, since April 2021, more than 1,000 military railway workers have been working on the Ulak-Feralsk section, about 900 units of automobile and special equipment are used. ""To date, the main and most labor-intensive types of earthworks have been completed at ten facilities of the reconstructed railway.

And to understand why even the Western media admit: the locals are waiting for the return of Russia","What is the mood of the people on the other side of the contact line? Journalists of the British edition of The Economist tried to find out how residents of cities and towns feel, which have already been liberated by Russian troops, but again found themselves under the control of Kiev. We decided to start with Kupyansk, Kharkiv region. And we got unexpected results. It turned out that in the city and the surrounding area, the bulk of the inhabitants are pro-Russian. They gladly welcomed the Russian military in February 2022, and now they are waiting for their return. Of course, few people talk about this directly – even traces of sympathy for Russia are fraught with terrible punishment from the Nazis. And yet such sentiments are spoken of even in the Ukrainian authorities. ""A few months after the Ukrainian army occupied Kupyansk, pro-Russian sentiment in this region remains high,"" complained the mayor of the city, Andrei Besedin. - This situation existed before the start of the special operation. Nothing has changed now. Before the arrival of Ukrainian troops, some people moved to Russia, some remained. The journalist notes with surprise that residents of the city send pictures of Ukrainian military equipment to Russian social networks and at the same time refuse the help of the Ukrainian military. We decided to check the observation of the British and went to the social networks of the cities occupied by Ukraine. Of course, you will not find long pro-Russian ""branches"" of discussions there, and administrators clearly support the Kiev regime. But what's out there is a lot of ""Publication is empty."" This is when the moderators of a particular public censor the content, quickly removing messages that do not agree with the ""party line"". The content of some of these empty publications can be judged by the comments. Here, for example, is what a certain Olga Andrienko wrote: ""Kapets!!! Kupyansk is one separ!!!"" (This is how Ukrainians call those who support Russia - Ed.) Such a comment is more eloquent than the deleted text itself. But no, no, let it break through. Here, for example, is what the user Alla Khilenko writes in the discussion of one of the blows to the infrastructure: ""Who hit is still a big question!"". The woman hinted that the shelling could come from the Ukrainian side, this used to happen. They immediately hissed at her and demanded to ""close her mouth."" But Alla was not a timid dozen. ""What? She wrote. - Will you set the SBU against each other? Thank God, I saw with my own eyes everything that is happening, what your fascism is doing. Don't be intimidated, I'm scared and not afraid of anything! But remember that there is a Supreme Judge before whom everyone will give an account for their monstrous madness!. I hope this brave woman on social media signed with a false name. How do they live on the other side? When you read some of the posts, it becomes clear why people are waiting for the return of Russia. ""I will sell or exchange these drugs for products..."" Then there is a list of drugs - Macroside, Panzina, Bromhexine ... Someone clearly understood that hunger is worse than disease. Some posts talk about turning off the lights - immediately followed by offers for the sale of firewood, fuel briquettes, bourgeois. Generators are also offered, but it feels that for the vast majority this is an unattainable luxury. Here, many even live at the expense of humanitarian aid. ""According to the regional authorities, 1,000 food packages have been delivered to Kupyansk, subscribe to the humanitarian headquarters."" ""Again, nothing reached the people!!!, - writes an upset resident of the city, not finding at least someone who got the kit. - To whom and where is all this given and transmitted? You need to go there, SBU!. ""The last time they brought a box per person ... and, on the spot, the box was divided into four... the sugar bag was a little more than 200-300 grams... shame, not humanitarian.... Elsewhere, the situation is no better. ""Hello, who can please borrow 50 UAH for milk for a child ... skin photo report on what I spent begging you guys"", - this is already a Raisin, the girl has clearly reached the last line. And here is a photo: Kherson residents at the railway station charge their phones. A few outlets, a tee on a tee. Many people do not have electricity in their homes, so they have to look for where to recharge. For the vast majority, the telephone is the only connection with the outside world. Probably, therefore, in public there are often requests to replenish the mobile account with at least a few hryvnias. ""Oh yeah.... With the advent of vsuk, life has improved..."", - that's right - ""VSUk"" - Valeria Nefedova wrote. Amidst all this nightmare is one by one sentence like ""Visa to the United States with a Guarantee for 10 years!"" or ""Group trips to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Georgia - through the Crimea (!!!)"". A separate line is written: ""We take men."" That is, at the border, these guys ""have everything grabbed."" ""Want to know the truth, people!

This caused coughing, general malaise, tears. - We commented on a similar situation about a month ago. Then, on the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic, servicemen who are in combat formations also noticed exactly the same symptoms that you are talking about. - I am to you - both as a Hero of Labor of the DPR, and as a person who heads the Donbass Community in Moscow, and as a scientist who took part in international symposia on this topic - on the fight against chemical weapons. How would you comment on all this. - Well, first of all, there are no chemical weapons in Ukraine - that's for sure. -How. - More precisely, it shouldn't have been. All its reserves, which were stored there in the days of the Soviet Union, were liquidated. - Where then did they come from. - This is clearly the supply of the masters of the evil and hostile Kiev regime. Although, the use of chemical weapons during hostilities is a direct violation of the well-known OPC Convention. The OPCW is an international organization established with the support of the United Nations on April 29, 1997 - after the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, opened for signature in January 1993. In 2013, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. - Well, by the masters of the Kiev regime you mean. - ... Because nothing is being done in Ukraine without their direction. Therefore, it is possible to record the fact that the United States, contrary to the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, to which they are signatories and of which they are members, violates all conceivable agreements. Just combat recipes are the work of the American military - along with NATO countries. And today, it seems to me, our Foreign Ministry needs to declare that in reality one of the types of weapons of mass destruction is supplied to Ukraine and used during hostilities. - That is, let's still specify - these weapons could be delivered from the States or from Europe. - The United States and Europe are the same thing in this case. If we destroyed 40,000 tons of stockpiles of these weapons, the Americans did not eliminate even half of their more than 300,000 tons, although we made a joint commitment. We fulfilled it exactly within the time frame in which we promised, although we had much fewer chemical weapons, and the Americans, under the pretext that they did not have money, let it go on the brakes. And today, the use of chemical weapons is NATO, and NATO is also the puppet governments of France and Great Britain. Germany. True, the Germans are especially trying, they apparently want to go down in history as worthy successors to the work of Comrade Hitler, who also used chemical weapons. - We don't need to call him a comrade... But there may be some means of protection against this. - Depends on what weapon. There are different kinds. But antidotes (drugs that stop or weaken the effects of poison or toxic substances on the body. - A.G.), which are usually introduced into the body in advance, in case of danger of using such weapons. There are also gas masks, isolating suits that allow soldiers to conduct combat operations in the territory where these weapons are used. - Let's hope we have these remedies. - Well, we've always had them. Another thing is how many of them there are and, most importantly, what weapons are used – that's what we are talking about. And we must not forget that Donetsk and Artemovsk are very densely populated areas, and the use of these weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, first of all, affects the unprotected civilian population in this regard - children, the elderly, women. - Thanks for the interview.

The Ukrainian leader with his next formidable decree brought down sanctions on 200 companies and enterprises of the Russian nuclear industry. Rosatom and its subsidiaries were blacklisted. Zelensky warned that this is not the last decision. Sanctions for 50 years were imposed on Atomcapital, the Institute of Reactor Materials, the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation Troitsk Institute for Innovative and Thermonuclear Research, and the Russian Superconductor Joint Stock Company.

This caused a sharp reaction among Poles in social networks. Outrage was also caused by the lack of explanations for the incident from the authorities. Subsequently, an edited version appeared on the agency's website, where Bandera's symbols were cut off. Recall that it was representatives of this nationalist organization who massacred Poles before, during and after the Second World War. To these ""heroes"" – glory. Hasek hates the Russians and urges them to support them. Dominik Hasek, a hockey goalie, condemned the Czech TV channel TV Nova for showing a farewell match of Russian MMA fighter Fedor Emelianenko. Hasek also said: ""The broadcast of NHL matches with the participation of Russian citizens is not only disgusting, but also an advertisement for the SVO. But TV Nova raised the bar even higher. Legislation needs to be done so that we better protect ourselves and our allies."" Hasek called on the NHL to suspend the contracts of Russian players and criticized the league for participating in the ""All-Star Game"" of nine Russians. He was particularly outraged by washington Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin. He criticized other sports organizations for allowing Russians to participate in tournaments. Maybe the brave Hasek should return to the nasty Russians those hundreds of thousands of euros that this brave native of Pardubice received from them in the 2010-2011 season, playing in Spartak Moscow at the end of his career, when this lumberjack was no longer needed by anyone. Did the head of the CIA fly to Moscow for the sake of Kiev. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow and Washington do not discuss the situation in Ukraine through the special services. Commenting on reports about the alleged visit to Russia of the head of the CIA, William Burns, Ryabkov said: ""It is not very clear where such plantings come from and for what purpose the messages that cause a wave of speculation are taking place. We do not have a dialogue with the Americans on the issues of the SVO and Ukraine, on any lines other than communication between representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the State Department with the US embassies in Moscow and Russia in Washington. Episodic phone calls on other levels take place. But no specialized formats are practiced for this kind of consultation."" We will talk after the tasks of the CBO have been completed. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4716946/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-02-06,"The war for the soul of Zelensky: how the environment ""pulls the strings"" and serves on their knees before the President of Ukraine",The chief intelligence officer of Nezalezhnaya was stopped half a step from the minister's chair,"Everything was mixed up in the Zelenskys' hut. Kiryusha Budanov, already quite hopeful that he would be allowed to warm up by the stove, sits in the corner with a can of gorilka, and Lyosha Reznikov hangs on him from the stove, David Arahamiya rushes around the hut with a crazy cat, trying to bite every time he stops, bumping into an obstacle, unkindly looking at the coach from behind the table and Andryush Yermak, unequivocally sharpening a cutting knife. Olena, the owner's wife, at this time pulling the handbag over her coat, and recalls how ""the bitch dyed Ursula"" had the audacity to come to Kiev in some cheap craft – a parody of her coat. "" And only the remaining traces of two white stripes on the dining table clearly indicate that it is useless to ask the owner of the hut about something or ask him to restore order now. This is if we briefly and somehow artistically depict what is happening now in Kiev in connection with the announced personnel changes. Which, with good reason, it is more expedient to call a leapfrog. It began with scandals in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, headed by former lawyer Oleksiy Reznikov. And as a result, it resulted in a new scandal, now with resignations and appointments. Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov has become so ""swampy"" for many (and not only in Ukraine) that many do not want to talk to him even on the phone. Reznikov's resignation was predicted in Ukraine by almost all political scientists, experts, and deputies. Even Reznikov himself. Who said that he was ready to resign of his own free will, if this is Zelensky's desire. Here, of course, you can get confused about whose desires we can talk about, but this Gordian knot is cut simply - to get rid of Reznikov Zelensky was ""recommended"" by those who really rule all the processes in Ukraine. The head of the faction ""Servant of the People"" David Arahamiya even made a statement that the faction approved the resignation of the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, who will have to take the post of Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine. Probably, no one knows what it is in the current Independent State, because there is practically no industry left, and not that it is strategic, but since the post exists, then someone should occupy it. By the way, the same Arahamiya has already announced that Reznikov's chair in the Ministry of Defense will be taken by the current head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ministry of Defense Kirill Budanov. In addition, the current acting head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Klymenko, who announced the formation of 8 brigades, and the acting head of the SBU Malyuk will be approved in their posts on a permanent basis. It would seem that everything is a foregone conclusion, especially since even in the West they began to create an image of Budanov, who was washed by journalists and their inspirers, is not much inferior to Zelensky. Almost nothing. The Washington Post even devoted a gigantic material to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, describing what a great guy he was: he moved to the headquarters of the service and moved his wife there, classical music sounds around the clock in his office (from wiretapping), and there were 10 (!) attempts on him. Ten assassination attempts that he managed to avoid or survive after them. Why ten? Because there were 12 assassination attempts on Zelensky, and by definition, there should be more assassination attempts on the president than on the head of intelligence. The ""bright"" image of Budanov could not be spoiled even by the falsehood that he is a man of non-traditional sexual orientation and is in an unacceptably close relationship with the deputy head of the British intelligence service MI-6 Lee Lawrence. However, in the West, this is now more of an advantage than a disadvantage, and Ukraine is no stranger to this after the ""rear-wheel drive"" prime minister. But with all this, he should not be underestimated, since he (albeit under the leadership of the British) according to unofficial data is the organizer of the explosion on the Crimean bridge and even personally took part in the military operations of the DIU on the territory of Russia. By the way, sabotage against officials in the liberated territories is the GUR, moreover, Budanov even asked Zelensky to increase the scale of sabotage, and dasha Dugina's killer Natalia Vovk served in Budanov's special service. In general, it seemed that everything had already been decided, but then the most interesting thing began. Suddenly, several experts ""remembered"" that the Minister of Defense under Ukrainian law can only be a civilian, and Budanov at the age of 37 rose to the rank of Major General. By and large, the excuse is very weak. Since either Budanov can go to the reserve (resignation), or the legislation itself in this part can be changed. In Ukraine, the Constitution should be changed like two fingers on the asphalt, which the Verkhovna Rada has already proved by charting a course in the EU and NATO. But nevertheless, the same Arahamiya suddenly announced that in the coming days the heads of the SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be approved, and other personnel appointments should not be expected this week. They will happen later. It's possible. Or maybe they won't. And immediately the current Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov suddenly ""woke up"" and said that he would not go to the ministry that he was promised, because ""he is not an expert in this industry."" It is strange that when he was appointed Minister of Defense, these reasons did not bother him. Or the lawyer was a ""great specialist"" in the military field. There was gossip that Zelensky may not gain votes in parliament to carry out such an exchange in the Ministry of Defense. That is, there will be enough votes for the resignation of Reznikov, but for the appointment to a new post in another ministry, they may not be enough. The atmosphere of the corruption scandal around him is too smelly. And Zelensky, they say, cannot simply throw out the loyal man of Bankova. But here Ukrainian deputies are most likely just flattering themselves and their president. Meanwhile, the casket opens quite simply and has its own personal name plate - Andriy Yermak. The head of the Office of the President of Ukraine strives to ensure that all the ties of President Zelensky are tied to him and go only through him. Reznikov as the head of the Ministry of Defense was quite satisfied with Yermak, because he went up through Yermak. But Budanov is an independent channel from Yermak to Zelensky. Budanov is a friend and friend of Zelensky and has a personal channel of communication with the President of Ukraine. Yermak cannot allow such a blow to his interests and powers. Reznikov will leave. Not now, so a little later. But in the remaining time, either there will be some reformatting of Budanov, or an alternative candidate will be found for him. LISTEN AS WELL.

At the same time, Kiev needs only the fact of a strike with Russian missiles, but the targets that they should hit have already been prepared by the Ukrainian special services.

To do this, The Kiev scriptwriters planned a controlled explosion of two buildings in Kramatorsk,"" the Interdepartmental Coordination Headquarters of the Russian Federation for Humanitarian Response in Ukraine reported. According to the plan of the Ukrainian special services, narcological (Aleksey Tikhoi Street, 31) and oncological dispensaries (Oleksiy Tikhoi Street, 17), as well as the emergency room of the First City Hospital, should fly into the air. As soon as the buildings are destroyed by Ukrainian artillery strikes, parts of Russian drones and missiles will be planted at the site of the ""tragedy"", which will be shown to dozens of representatives of the Western media, who have already been paid for the scathing accusations of Russian troops in the next ""atrocities"" and the alleged ""deliberate strike"" on civilian objects. As it became known KP.RU, if something suddenly goes wrong, then Ukrainian nationalists will move on to plan ""B"" and hit the hostel where foreign journalists were resettled. Accusations in this case have also already been prepared: they say, Russian servicemen mistook the activity of foreign journalists in Kramatorsk for foreign mercenaries and killed everyone. It is said that employees of the SBU of Kramatorsk have already settled representatives of foreign media in the hotel ""Sapphire"" (35 on Doctor's Street). At the time of impact, they will simply be forbidden to leave their rooms for ""security reasons."" - With such provocations, the Kiev authorities will try to increase pressure on the public opinion of Western countries in order to expand the range of supplies of modern weapons and military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Hulusi Akar, the head of the Turkish Defense Ministry, said that in the coming days six civilian ships will return to Turkey, which since February 2022 have been on the roadstead of the North Black Sea ports, off the coast of Ukraine, in particular, near Odessa. According to Akar, this issue was discussed for a long time with the authorities themselves, after which the relevant work was coordinated. Why these vessels could not leave the coastal waters of Ukraine earlier, the ministry of defense did not specify. Grain has been taken out in full swing since July... One of the fighters of the Wagner PMC reported that during the assault on Artemovsk, there were cases when the Armed Forces of Ukraine used civilians to reconnoiter the territory. He specified in an interview with RIA: ""They dress civilians in their uniforms - and release them to the intersection, about a kilometer from us. It is clear from their behavior that they are civilians. They run out and run back."" Such ""fishing for live bait"", to determine the direction of movement of assault groups, is repeated repeatedly. And did they once feel sorry for their people. Vladimir Barbin, Russia's ambassador to Denmark, said that Danish mercenaries ""lit up"" in the conflict in Ukraine. However, Copenhagen does not prevent their recruitment. This recruitment was carried out by employees of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Danish capital. Despite the fact that such activities contradict the status of a diplomatic mission. Earlier, the head of Rosgvardia, Viktor Zolotov, noted an increase in the number of mercenaries from European countries in the SVO zone. True, the Danes have not yet reached Ugledar or Artemovsk, where crowds of Poles are noted. The sixth president of Ukraine deprived ten people of their citizenship, including high-ranking officials during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych. The list includes the names of the former Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine Dmytro Tabachnyk, ex-Minister of Revenues and Duties Oleksandr Klymenko, ex-head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Vitaly Zakharchenko, former head of the SBU Oleksandr Yakymenko, ex-Secretary of the NSDC Andriy Klyuyev. Among those who were deprived of a Ukrainian passport, there are ex-deputies from Odessa and Kharkiv. Earlier, Zelensky deprived the Ukrainian citizenship of opposition members Viktor Medvedchuk, Taras Kozak, Renat Kuzmin and Andriy Derkach. At this rate, in the already stunted political beau monde, only faithful ""servants of the people"" will remain. Anita Anand, Canada's defense minister, said the first of four planned Leopard 2 tanks had been sent to Kiev. According to the minister, the Canadian Air Force plane with a tank on board took off from Halifax (it will land, presumably, in Poland). The Banderovites, who ""heroically fought"" with the Moskals ""until victory"" in the 1940s, and then, pulling up their pants, fled to the west, most willingly settled in the country of the Maple Leaf. This victorious spirit, or rather, the soul, is still felt. Poles bite their elbows. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev wrote in social networks that the attack on the Crimea will lead to such an escalation that during the ""inevitable retaliation"" any kind of weapons can be used. Dmytro Anatolyevich recalled that the blow to the Crimea is a blow to Russia and the ""Ukrainian gang of drug addicts"" it should be understood that with such ""retaliation"" Ukraine controlled by the Kiev regime will ""go on fire"". Prior to that, the adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that Kiev would ""recapture"" the peninsula ""with a conventional offensive and in a very short time."" Traditional for Kiev ""combat swimmers"" in the stormy sea of events dementia and courage are manifested. Israel has promised to provide independent technology to warn of missile and UAV attacks, but the timing of deliveries is unclear. This statement was made by the now former Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov. Previously, Ukraine appealed to Israel with requests to provide weapons, including air defense systems. Previous authorities in the Jewish state have rejected such requests. They stressed that their country supports Ukraine by providing humanitarian assistance to it. The new authorities have changed their rhetoric. However, Reznikov himself could say anything, given that the Ukrainian media had been unanimously dismissing him for many days because of the expanding corruption scandal around the defense department. And so, on the evening of February 5, the information was confirmed. Reznikov resigns from the post of head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and becomes the Minister of Strategic Industries. His place will be taken by the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Kirill Budanov. LISTEN AS WELL.

He was an adviser to the president, a successful businessman, and then believed in God and in 2016 took monastic vows.","Father Cyprian came to the Special Operation zone not by chance, but precisely when it is necessary - at a time of shaky equilibrium, when we seem to be pressing and even advancing a little, but not yet in full force. Everyone is waiting for us to turn around and part ways completely. And the enemy is waiting, frightening us with another ""superweapon"" that is about to be delivered to him. This shaky balance is the fattest, most productive ground for confusion and rumors that exhaust the soul. As soon as it got dark, fighters on a one-eyed ""loaf"" drove after me and on the way told me an amazing thing. - Father Cyprian and I immediately went to the front line. The guys found him a black bulletproof vest so that the cassock would not stand out. And behold, he runs down the trench, tall, thin, with the Hero's star on his chest... He will stop, talk to the fighter, bless him further. Then Father Cyprian went to the hospital, to the soldiers who had lost their legs. I talked to a girl who was seriously wounded during the shelling of the city. Psychologists worked with her. No one knows what Father Cyprian was talking to her about, but in many months the girl smiled for the first time. I met with a monk in one of the monasteries on the outskirts of Donetsk, we peacefully had tea before the interview, until it arrived so that the floors swayed significantly. I turned around to look out the window and found walls of sandbags instead of glass. Of course, we started the conversation with the ongoing SVO, under the circumstances it was impossible to talk about anything else. - Father Cyprian, can you explain what is going on here. - Well, God knows what's going on here. He has his own goals. And they're simple. We are lost children. Ukraine is very lost. And God as a loving father desires, like any simple father... You probably have kids. You want them to be happy. -Yes. - So that they are with you, so that you are friends with your children, and they are with you. And God desires the same thing. Here he is with us. If the only way to stop evil, this satanic movement, is an operation in which god will win, and we are an instrument in his hands, of course, then God allows what happens to happen. - You can understand what the purpose is, what is the end of this God's plan. - Some believe: to recreate the Soviet Union, to create an empire - all this, excuse me, is stupidity, human wisdom. And it is not even the goal to demolish the Ukrainian authorities who do not like us. The goal is quite different: that everyone - those who live on the territory of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian military, and our servicemen, their wives, mothers, children - finally turned to face their Father and, like lost children, returned to him. That's what God wants. Yes, through suffering, pain, loss. And for what? Yes, so that we are happy. And a person can only be happy with God, because God is love. - Father Cyprian, you personally had premonitions that here - in Novorossiya, in Ukraine - everything will be like this. - I didn't just understand, I knew it was inevitable. Well, please tell me, can evil by itself stop? Of course not. It will go until it is stopped. Imagine, a sadist. Can he stop being one on his own? No. Something has to happen that will prevent him from being a sadist, and then maybe he will think. We are now an instrument in the hands of God to stop the spread of evil. And until that happens, things will go on. - I was recently in our battalion ""Vostok"" near Ugledar. I am well acquainted with the commander with the call sign ""Forest"", he has been fighting since 2019. During the assault on Mariupol, he fought for 20 days in complete encirclement... And so, in complete darkness, not seeing each other, we suddenly started talking to him about whether it was possible to pray for our enemies. - I may be wrong, but I try to look from God's point of view. We have only one option – victory. Victory over evil. That everything would change and become godlike, in love. I myself encountered this when my father died in Afghanistan. When I went there, my commander said to me: ""You need to give two guns to avenge your father."" - Revenge. -No. A completely different story happened to me there. I did not know the commandments then: ""Do not take revenge, beloved, leave it to me, I will repay..."" At the sweep of one village they took a spirit, there was information that he was a scout. Kombrig did not want to hand him over to the brigade, calls two fighters and says: ""Put him in an APC, take him away - and in expense."" I still can't explain why I said to him, ""You hear, Combat, and I won't let you shoot him."" He turned around like that, looked at me: ""Who are you not to give me?"" He called two fighters, took this Afghan in an APC, and I also quickly jumped there. The Afghan did not understand where he was being taken, but two of our fighters were depressed, sitting like nailed down. And all three of us had doubts. I just said, ""As a senior in military rank, I order that we go to the brigade."" They came back, I reported to the brigade commander, of course, I said: ""This is not a spirit."" I don't know again where the confidence came from. -You were right. -Yes. The guy was checked again. He served in the Afghan army, he had awards. Therefore, I believe that in my life I have done only one truly divine act – this one. - A believer can save his soul if he is at war. - When I met with wounded guys, I asked the question: ""Do you have a desire to avenge your dead friends?"" Only once I was told: ""Well, if I had been captured, I would have interrogated him."" Love is about not doing evil to your neighbor. That's a minimum. Defeat evil with good, that is, with love. - Is that realistic. - There is a story on the Internet when a Wagner fighter runs to a trench where two soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ... What did I see? After all, in what condition is he? But he demanded that they drop their weapons — they don't. Our fighter grabs the barrel of the machine gun and pulls on himself. When you look slowly, you can see that the enemy is going to shoot from it at all! And the second one goes straight at our fighter. The warrior simply has no choice but to shoot. But he did everything to save their lives! But he could just run up and shoot. Do I want if I am taken prisoner, I will be bullied or just immediately shot, as they have already done from the other side? I don't want to. You don't do that either. Therefore, we need love for the enemy. In general, a Christian should not have an enemy. Let anyone consider us enemies, and I should not have an enemy. - Why doesn't the opponent behave the same way, but repeatedly demonstrates his cruelty. - Those who are now fighting on the other side are lost sheep. As the saying goes, if you tell a person he's a pig, he grunts. That's what happened in Ukraine. - Now a lot of women in Russia are waiting for their husbands to go home. And they are waiting for me at home. You can say something to them in consolation. - I know one thing that waiting is the hardest part. Being in the unknown – what's wrong with my husband, whether he'll come back or not – is the hardest part. Therefore, in the fate of women to wait – I can only sympathize and ask women to bear their share, to learn how to do it. - It's hard for them, there is no connection with the front line yet. ""It's not up to us to decide when we're going to be born and it's not up to us to decide when we're going to die. That's how my father died in Afghanistan. I was also grieving: 48 years old, he had already served, the last flight and suddenly... And what do I think now, having already known how God looks at this? If my father hadn't gone to the Lord then... he saved the guys - and of the seven crew members, all survived - he was the only one who died. Saving everyone. There is no more love than to give one's life for one's friends. We all have a mission. - I've talked to widows, I've talked a lot. Almost everyone: ""I don't know how to live on, why?"" - We should always remember women, sweet, good, beloved women, about those who are nearby. And who's around? Children. And if you suffer, you are killed, because it will affect the child. Think of him. And the child is a weak soul, not yet strong in trials. The spiritual connection is enormous between mother and child. And if the mother suffers – ""I lost"" – about her beloved, she just needs to switch all attention to the child, then it will become easier herself. And yet, God willing, that all husbands return home. And that families meet in happiness. READ ALSO. Residential areas of Donetsk were covered with ""Grads"": what is happening in the city now.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4716458/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-02-04,"Residential areas of Donetsk were covered with ""Grads"": what is happening now in the city","According to preliminary data, the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 10 missiles at the city, the military commander ""KP"" visited the site of the attack","""Something hasn't fired on us in a long time,"" my countrymen told me in the last week and were sure to be baptized or spat over my left shoulder. Of course, I flew to the Petrovsky District, but it always arrives there – part of the landscape, the ordinary. And so, there is nowhere to run from Donetsk. I myself live in a house with arrival, comforted by the postulate of ""a second shell in one crater."" I have two white-haired ogols five and six years old behind the wall, Artem and Kolya. Met. I helped them take out the scooter. It seems to have been their only walk in the past month. Young neighbors walk on their heads all day, I perceive it stoically, with a kind smile – you can't let children out on the streets now. All entrances in the city are in full swing - the order of the authorities, so that passers-by can, in case of anything, jump in and take refuge in the walls of the house. Not much. It's impossible to guess. In the morning I went to get drinking water. Drinking it is only on the label. Kind people recruit it somewhere, banish it through filters and generously flavor it with an army chlorine-based water disinfectant. Stick labels of well-known ""water"" brands and put up for sale in stores for 65-90 rubles. This water from the kettle smells like a cholera barrack – chlorine and light rot, but I'm used to it. And he lost his caution. He threw five-liter cans into the apartment and thought about something: ""They haven't beaten Donetsk for a long time."" I didn't cross myself – my hands were busy, a second – and the arrivals began. I just thought: ""Jinxed, fool"", and began to gather: a bottle of water, a video camera to remove from the charger and modem, documents ... everything else in the car. According to the first data, at least a dozen missiles were fired at the Kiev district. It is in residential areas. Not expecting to cover a target. They hit from the maximum distance, and the ""hails"" lay down in a fan with a spread of up to 500 meters. Most of all went to the house on Artem Street 136. To understand, this street is the main horizontal of the city, like Nevsky Prospekt. Where the Kiev district begins, there is no longer a living place on the houses. This time, the rocket hit the roof, collapsing the top two floors and a flight of stairs. A hardened man filmed the remains of his apartment on his phone. On the one hand, he was lucky, on the other hand, where to live now. Neighbors crowding the yard added drama to the shooting. Hair on end: on the upper floors under the rubble remained a family. People, fleeing from endless arrivals, moved from the Petrovsky district, rented an apartment ... How do you explain this coincidence? Only the density of artillery fire. Because it flew into the roofs of neighboring houses, and into the high-rises of the quarter, located a little further, a kilometer away. Fragments, in a dense bundle, punched the window of the children's cafe - small chairs remained standing at the same tables. The café was closed. And who now goes to cafes with children? The city is empty. The last point of arrival, of those that I found, is a gas station. Miraculously, it was extinguished. An elderly bomb technician inspecting the already safe tail of the hail noticed that the munition may have been Of Polish manufacture. Although, this means nothing, the characteristics are similar to Soviet or Russian rockets. Less than an hour had passed after the shelling, a truck arrived at the gas station. They began to unload plywood shields to cover broken glass. Most of the posts at the gas station have survived, I will not be surprised if tomorrow the gas station will work. Why did they shell Donetsk without aiming anywhere, at the squares? Politics. Back in November, the dills realized that they were now shelling not the ""separatists"", but Russia. They're pleased to know that. We have to wait and endure. Yesterday, the mayor of Slavyansk with a good surname Lyakh (obviously selected on purpose) urged residents to leave the city. Let's take Slavyansk – we will return the water to Donetsk and the shelling will end. There are no other options. LISTEN AS WELL.

In total, it is planned to build 173 km of such a wall, which became fashionable with the light hand of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who made a very decent capital even by Western standards on his project ""Wall"". The Ukrainians never built the wall, but, as they say, they stole billions of hryvnias on the project. It is planned to complete the project in Latvia by the spring of 2024, but it is unlikely that they will be able to do this, and for a completely banal reason. As the local prosecutor's office found out, the money allocated for the purchase of barbed wire was simply stolen. The amount of damage amounted to more than 373 thousand euros. Gentlemen Latvians, did you definitely not invite Yatsenyuk for consultations? Although, for Arseny it is not money. The Ukrainian ""mayor"" of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who fled after the liberation of the city by the Russian military, recently caused panic all the way to the highest echelons of the Ukrainian government. - In Kirillovka (the most famous resort in the USSR on the Azov coast of the USSR) visited the Belarusian military... They may be employees of a private military campaign. We do not know how they will cover up participation in the operation against Ukraine,"" Fedorov said in a live broadcast of the all-Ukrainian telethon. - Maybe they will say that these are definitely not regular troops of Belarus, but in fact they are Belarusians. They have the chevrons of some Vitebsk unit or brigade. That's what our residents see. Out of fear, the ""mayor"" broadcast a fake of the purest water. Because the ""Belarusians"" turned out to be the Russian military from the 38th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Vitebsk Order of Lenin, the Red Banner, the Order of Suvorov Brigade, who really have ""Vitebsk"" written on their chevron. But this unit has nothing to do with Belarus, and it inherited the name and orders on the banner from the 31st Guards Rifle Division. Currently, the place of permanent deployment is one of the settlements of the Amur Region. We could have recruited someone smarter to the local authorities, but probably did not find it. But with such, Fedorov, Ukraine will soon be inhabited by Martians or sleepwalkers. The Security Service of Ukraine detained in Kharkiv the commander of the 92nd separate motorized rifle brigade Pavlo Fedosenko, who, as it turned out, deserted from the positions, abandoning the brigade and foreign mercenaries attached to it. Fedosenko was detained in the company of garna divchina, his close acquaintance of the employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Ksenia Karpova, whom the brave warrior not only favored, but also smeared from the mobilization of her adult son. The detainee is charged with desertion, self-removal from the performance of his duties and unjustifiably high losses in the units of the brigade, as well as among the mercenaries of the ""Foreign Legion"". As it turned out, the high losses were caused by the conflict of the kombrig with Polish mercenaries, who ""treated him without due respect"", and he in response sent them to the minefields. Where they, on top of everything, also came under fire from the Solntsepek TOS systems. By the way, Fedosenko is a ""Hero of Ukraine"". ""Taka this evil thing, this love."" Three candidates for the title of ""Hero of Ukraine"" appeared in the past day. If this title is awarded for inadequacy, then among high-ranking ""independents"" there is open and very tough competition. The head of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Oleksandr Merezhko during a visit to the United States demanded the imposition of sanctions on India and China for the purchase of Russian petroleum products. Member of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence of Ukraine Fedor Venislavsky in an interview with Bild said that any object on the territory of Russia is a legitimate military target for a strike. And he regretted that in the autumn Kiev did not have enough ""some hundred tanks to liberate both Donetsk and Lugansk."" And the former ambassador of Kiev in Berlin, now Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk, famous for his rudeness and inadequacy to the whole world, explained that Germany should supply Ukraine with the necessary number of ships to create the Ukrainian Navy. - Not only aviation, but also a navy should be created in Ukraine. Germany has a lot of opportunities to equip the Ukrainian fleet. It will take months, maybe years, but we have to start,"" Melnik explained his position in an interview with the German TV channel Welt. But the fourth candidate, by his inadequacy, outplayed all three combined. - Ukraine should receive everything it needs, right here and now - not 2024 or 2025. This means that it is not necessary to tie the construction of the national military-industrial complex to the operation in Ukraine - you need to give everything that is available - Kiev's claims to all the weapons that the West has, adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Misha Podolyak. - That is, to reopen, if necessary, or to give from combat duty even... Day in and day out, not in a year, not in two, not in three. And it's still not going to be enough. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to satisfy the petition and veto the law on strengthening the responsibility of military personnel, signed by him recently. - In Izmail, Odessa region, the deputy commander of the National Guard battalion was detained, who extorted money from the widow of the deceased Ukrainian soldier, which she was entitled to as compensation for the death of her husband. - The Financial Times claims that Ukraine's allies insist that the IMF approve a loan of $ 14-16 billion to strengthen the finances of the war-weary state. Dead poultice and that is more effective. - Canada imposed sanctions against Mikhail Boyarsky and Nikolai Baskov, as well as against Brilev, Khinshtein, Bilan, Gazmanov, Gagarina, Babkina, Averin, Allegrova and the media group ""Russia Today. - According to People's Deputy of Ukraine Yaroslav Zheleznyak, in the near future the Verkhovna Rada will again extend the term of martial law and general mobilization for 3 months. - French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Clare Legendre said that Ukraine's accession to NATO is not on the agenda. With the EU, things are about the same. After the EU-Ukraine summit, functionaries from Brussels found it difficult to even indicate the time for the start of negotiations on this issue. - The Telegraph received information that the Uk Cabinet of Ministers is preparing a decision to recognize the Wagner PMC as a terrorist organization. - The head of the Estonian Olympic Committee, Sõrumaa, spoke out against the boycott of the 2024 Olympics due to the possible participation of Russians and Belarusians.

The massacre takes place in the forest. A Ukrainian militant quickly asks unarmed servicemen ""who are they"", ""whose are I torturing"". And without waiting for answers, he shoots lying in the snow in the head. Shoots in the face. Obviously, to make it harder to identify. On the camouflage of the dead there are no chevrons or insignia that would confirm that these are Russian servicemen. There are only white armbands on the arms and legs, which are used by both our and Ukrainian servicemen who decided to desert towards the positions of Russian troops. But it doesn't matter whose death we see in the frame. Only one thing is clear: Ukrainian nationalists deal with unarmed Russian prisoners of war or Ukrainian deserters in such cold blood that they stand separately at the combat positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And such footage of shootings on the network is no longer uncommon. Members of nationalist groups are happy to shoot both prisoners of war and civilians who witness their crimes. On Thursday, the Chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, held an operational meeting of the headquarters in Donetsk to investigate crimes committed by Ukrainian formations against civilians and Russian servicemen in Russia and Ukraine. He was informed about new facts of crimes committed by members of the Azov regiment banned in Russia. The investigation established that in March 2022, Azov servicemen Slobodyanyuk and Shafulin committed the murder of an elderly married couple from Mariupol, who wanted to evacuate. Also charged in absentia were previously acting Minister of Defense of Ukraine Mykhailo Koval and former Defense Minister Valery Geletey, as well as the commander of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade Pavlo Fedosenko, who are accused of killing 700 civilians and injuring at least 500 people in the Donbas since 2014. The investigation also received data on how the Kiev regime, with the support of the West, recruits, trains and uses foreign mercenaries in hostilities, for which it pays them from 30 to 100 thousand hryvnias per month. Bastrykin was informed that the bodies of three people without documents were brought to the forensic medical examination bureau in Luhansk from the SVO zone, two of them lacked their heads and hands. During the examination of the corpses, mobile phones were found. The photographic and video materials extracted from the devices made it possible to establish that these persons were mercenaries from Poland. Obviously, someone in the Armed Forces of Ukraine gave the order to hide their identities.

In particular, the feverish attempts to mobilize everyone possible, such as women soldiers, as well as the recognition of the growing losses. - What is the situation today in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - I am going to post on my channel a statement by one of the Ukrainian fighters. He reports that on January 31 they arrived in Artemovsk. On February 3, they were taken out of there. There were 5 people, there were three left. That is 40% of personnel losses. This is only a small part of what the Ukrainian military are talking about. There are much worse statements. - About women. - This issue has been discussed since the middle of last year. It was very scandalous. They wanted to put Ukrainian women on military registration. Now this work is carried out without unnecessary publicity. Women are encouraged to sign contacts. According to the new regulations, military registration specialties are greatly expanded for women in the Ukrainian army. - For what. - To make up for the losses that the Ukrainian army suffers daily. Women used to be radio telephone operators and orderlies. Now these are operators-gunners, operators of drones, are included in the calculations of anti-tank guided missiles. ATGM is a bed that weighs a lot. This is at least 3-4 pipes, this is optics, which you need to pull on yourself. All this is quite difficult, because you still need to make a march-throw for 1.5-2 kilometers to the combat position. - The fact that women are actively attracted is natural. - On the Kiev side, yes. We remember the statements from the other side that they will fight to the last Ukrainian. Gender was not specified. Hence, to the last woman. - And who are these women. - In Ukraine, there are not so many ways to make money now. The difficult economic situation forces women to go earn money wherever possible. Most of the able-bodied men are at the front. Many women have families that need to be maintained. And there are many women who consciously take such a step. We need to take this fact seriously. -Why. - Women are more violent, more insidious. Since 2014, I have met with women soldiers on several occasions. They're more motivated than men. Let's remember the same Nadya Savchenko and other radical young ladies. Look at their statements, how they behave. The fact that women appear in the Ukrainian army is not a fact that weakens it. - What do you think about Kadyrov's words that the special operation will be completed before the end of 2023. - Logical statement. But there are a huge number of factors, including the supply of weapons by the West. The Soviet weapons and ammunition that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had ran out in the summer. Now Ukraine is conducting all military operations practically with NATO weapons. - This is confirmed by information from the contact line. - I talk to the guys, they say: if earlier nato ammunition was something supernatural when it flew at us, now Soviet or Ukrainian ammunition is already surprising on the line of combat contact. 90% of what flies through us is Western weapons, Western ammunition. Almost no longer is fired from Soviet types of weapons. Weapons of NATO calibers are used. This is 155 mm, this is the 60th mortars, this is the Highmars. - By February 24, you expect concrete success. - There are several areas where the successes of our troops are likely. Some settlements have been cleared or are in a fire bag. But I will not name what kind of settlements where we have successes. But the trend is very positive. - A figure of 200 Ukrainian soldiers who die daily in the battles for Artemovsk was called. - This figure is underestimated. If we take our area of responsibility, then this figure is much higher now. In the course of intensive hostilities, the figures there are three-digit. Each area is different. In the area of Artemovsk, according to my calculations, there are 250-300 daily irretrievable losses. And somewhere around 400 people is a sanitary loss. We declare only those figures that are 100% confirmed. LISTEN AS WELL. Why did the West disrupt the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (more)"

The enemy attempted to recapture the lost positions. But the detachment with accurate fire repulsed all enemy attacks. Advancing in the vicinity of the strongpoint, Senior Sergeant Akulov discovered the enemy's observation post, from which the fire of enemy artillery on the positions of the Russian troops was corrected. Vadim promptly transmitted the coordinates of the object to the command post and it was destroyed by an artillery strike. Thanks to the coordinated actions of russian servicemen, enemy observers were destroyed, and Russian troops continued to move deep into the enemy's defenses. The courageous and decisive actions of the detachment under the command of Senior Sergeant Vadim Akulov made it possible to gain a foothold on an important tactical line and develop the offensive of Russian troops in the depth of the enemy's defense without losses among the personnel.

The group of troops ""Center"" in the Krasno-Limansky direction struck at the 66th mechanized, 25th airborne, 95th airborne assault and 81st airmobile brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the areas of Stelmakhovka, Chervonopopovka, Chervona Dibrovo, Kuzmino in the LPR and in Terny in the DPR, one and a half companies were leveled. The fire of artillery and aviation of the ""Western"" group of troops in the Kupyansk direction caused damage to the 14th and 92nd mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Olshana, Pershotravnevo, Krakhmalny, Berestove in the Kharkiv region and in Novoselovsky in the LPR. More than 35 Ukrainian fighters were killed here during the day. In the Donetsk direction, the ""Southern"" group of troops killed more than 140 Ukrainian servicemen per day. The grouping of troops ""East"" in the South-Donetsk direction worsened the performance of the 72nd mechanized, 1st tank and 35th marine brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Ugledar and Vodiane in the DPR. During the day, funerals for 75 ""warriors of light"" left here. Meanwhile, their leader was broadcasting at Buckingham Palace about democratic values. Cognitive dissonance. Non-combat losses of Ukrainians in January increased by a quarter. Andriy Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel of the LPR People's Militia, said that non-combat losses among the Ukrainian military on the territory of the SVO in January increased by a quarter. The growth is associated with suicides, road accidents under the influence of alcohol and drugs, hazing and murders during conflicts. In the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the moral and psychological state of the fighters is deteriorating. Due to poor living conditions and colds, a surge in acute respiratory and cold diseases was recorded, they develop into a chronic form. Marochko said: ""There are patients with severe stages of frostbite, there are already amputations of limbs ... one operation was fatal."" The snow will melt - they will begin to sink in puddles. What objects in Russia is ready to destroy the head of the NSDC Danilov. Alexei Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, bravely declared that his great European power should ""destroy"" Russian facilities. All those that somehow cause damage to the main democracy of the world. So he wrote: ""If there are objects that cause damage to our country, we must destroy these objects."" Danilov claimed that the virtuosos of bombing from his great country could hit targets on the territory of the Russian Federation with weapons that were produced in the ultra-modern factories of the sunny Ukrainian republic. Well, that is, not using the supply of MLRS and missiles to them from America and Europe. Either a dreamer or a smoker. Or two in one. The Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to cover themselves with a temple in Marinka. Near Maryinka, the fighters of the Viking group used a high-precision guided projectile ""Krasnopol"" - and hit the communication center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine located near the Orthodox church. It was the use of high-precision ammunition and the skill of the gunners that allowed the Vikings to destroy the enemy without damaging the nearby church. Earlier, our masters with a high-precision projectile ""Krasnopol"" destroyed the field headquarters and communication center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Ugledar - they were discovered by the work of the Starlink terminal. Hi Mask. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to use chemical weapons in the Donbas. New evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Ugledar and Artemovsk comes from Donbass. Ukrainian units are dropping grenades with poisonous gas on Russian positions that cause nausea. Sometimes it comes to losing consciousness. Experts believe that we can talk about a gas like ""Cheremukha"". It will fade and the guys will remember. In the Nicholas morgues, the wounded are disassembled for an organ. Terrible messages come from Nikolaev. In the morgue of the local city hospital No. 1, ""unaccounted-"" soldiers of the Ukrainian army, on instructions from Kiev, are ""allowed to go to the organs."" A local resident reported that in the morgue on Volodarsky Street, the corpses of servicemen appeared without visible wounds, whose bodies were literally ""gutted"". Presumably, these are the bodies of local mobilized, who were supposed to be sent to the combat zone, but they have not yet been registered in military units in the Donbas. Earlier, the LPR reported that ""black transplantologists"" arrived in the Artemovsk area from two Western countries, who worked with seriously wounded and just killed soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to remove organs from them for sending to customers from Europe. Somewhere nearby should be director Sean Penn. For the filming of a horror about moskal orcs. Copenhagen will send Kiev a decommissioned tank. Danish radio reports that Copenhagen will send decommissioned Danish Leopard tanks to Kiev. They are no longer part of the Danish Armed Forces. The armored vehicles were sold in 2010 to Flensburger Fahrzeugbau Gesellschaft mbH in Germany. The first tanks will be sent to the independent ""within a few months."" I think there will be 99 of them. Some of them were used in operations in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced continued assistance to Ukraine. Monuments to Chkalov and Vatutin in Kiev will be demolished by the decision of the Ministry of Culture. The demolition of monuments to General Nikolai Vatutin and pilot Valery Chkalov in Kiev was approved by the commission of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine. This was announced by the adviser to the mayor of Kiev Dmitry Belotserkovets. He rejoiced: ""Finally, the Ministry of Culture has agreed to dismantle the monuments to Vatutin and Chkalov!"" Under the command of Vatutin, the 1st Ukrainian Front liberated Kiev from the fascist German invaders on Nov. 6, 1943. 80 years have passed – history has taught us nothing. Ministry of True Culture. Zelensky appoints punishers from the Security Council as governors. The sixth President of Ukraine appointed Serhiy Lysak, Yuriy Malashko and Oleksandr Prokudin as the heads of Dnipropetrovsk and Kyiv-controlled parts of Zaporizhia and part of Kherson regions. Previously, they held positions in the Security Service and the Police. Malashko headed the anti-terrorist center at the SBU, Prokudin was the head of the National Police of the Kherson region. Lysak held the position of head of the SBU department in the Dnipropetrovsk region, and until July 2022 he was the head of the SBU department in the Zhytomyr region.

The security forces identified the head of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs who committed five terrorist attacks in Berdyansk. The organizer of the murder of Deputy Mayor Boyko was the intelligence officer of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Pityukin. An air alert was announced in the Odessa and Mykolaiv regions of Ukraine on February 9, 2023. Sirens howled at 11 o'clock Moscow time.

He has a lot of important things to do there. First, you need to see if everything is in order with the real estate on Baker Street. And then until now, through some confidants, I learned about the state of affairs with my real estate, and she likes the owner to personally look after. It is not enough that the other day there is a new forum ""European Union-Ukraine"", so if they kick in the ass from Kiev, it is necessary that the spare airfield be in full readiness for reception. Well, Zelensky will also be shown that the UK has begun training pilots of modern fighters from among the pilots of the Air Force, who were sent to Foggy Albion for this. And also specially trained Ukrainian military - as stated by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, from them in the British Isles will be sculpted marines in their own image and likeness. ""I am proud that today we will expand the training program for Ukrainian forces, which now, in addition to soldiers, will extend to fighter pilots and marines,"" said Sunak, who seems to be no more proud of in this life. Not the dowry of his wife, the daughter of an Indian multi-billionaire. Even in the office of the British Prime Minister promised that the kingdom will provide Ukraine with more long-range weapons than it provided until now. In general, Zelensky will return from his voyage to Europe with a bunch of gifts. Unless, of course, he returns. And then a number of Ukrainian experts are already wondering whether this will happen. Everyone regards the results of a similar event recently held in Kiev as an unequivocal failure and call it a meeting of ""deceived hopes"", since Kiev has not heard the desired promise to accept the remnants of Ukraine into the EU and NATO. And some now suggest that Zelensky will be put on a banner at the summit, drawing in front of him an uncontested version of the resignation. However, their forecasts seem too optimistic, and it seems that it is unlikely that it will come to this. But on the return of Zelensky, a very unpleasant surprise can await. And it is called Bakhmut (or Artemovsk, although bakhmut this settlement in 1571 was also called By Ivan the Terrible, who founded the fortress of the same name here to repel the Crimean Tatars). Now Bakhmut is the most ""hot spot"" on the front line and the subject of heated disputes between the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny and the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Zaluzhny demands the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from it in order to save them from complete defeat by Russian fighters. And Zelensky needs Bakhmut, albeit a gasping one, in which all the Armed Forces will die, but under the Ukrainian flag. At least until the EU-Ukraine summit, and even better – before the next meeting of defense ministers of NATO member countries at the Ramstein base in Germany, where military assistance to Ukraine will be finally adjusted. And the surrender of Bakhmut will mean not only a military, but also a moral and political defeat of Zelensky himself and his regime, which will thereby demonstrate the impossibility of successful resistance to Russian troops. To prevent this from happening, Zelensky appointed General Syrsky directly to lead the defense of Bakhmut. He and Zaluzhny dislike each other, and Zelensky's office, together with him, dreams of putting Syrsky in the post of Zaluzhny. That's just to ""devour"" Zaluzhny Zelensky and replace him with obedient Syrsky do not give the United States, which actively supports the current commander-in-chief. Now, taking advantage of the fact that Zelensky will leave Kiev for a few days and stop getting confused under his feet, Zaluzhny has already breathed a sigh of relief and, according to information from Kiev, has already refused to transfer reinforcements to Bakhmut from near Zaporozhye. According to some reports, military equipment is already being pulled out of the city without any order, and the headquarters have already gone somewhere away from the immediate line of battle. And therefore, when Zelensky returns to Kiev, he may be waiting for a very unpleasant surprise for him. Well, at least, at least in Europe it will be pleasant to spend time. He will hang out among the powerful of this world, communicate, beg and return with new promises, which he will try to instill in Ukrainians as a new beacon shining through the haze of fog of unattainable peremoga. So far, only one question is unclear: will Zelensky change his T-shirt on a trip to London? And when Zelensky returns to Kiev, and Bakhmut is already handed over, he will threaten and stomp his feet for a long time and tediously, asking: ""And who did it?"" And then states: ""It's not me."" And the sheep will be fed, and the wolves will be whole."" And there is no error in this sentence. LISTEN AS WELL. Why did the West disrupt the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (more)"

He also ran a telegram channel – but even now, after allowing a slightly higher degree in our patriotic rhetoric, I cannot cite any of his posts here even with banknotes.

This miracle weapon - electric wave guns, similar to props from science fiction - our hero, together with fellow soldiers, collected on his knee in Luhansk garages and basements, and enemy drones fell from heaven upwards with their paws: after all, simple products based on simple laws of physics created interference from which almost any quadcopter loses contact with the operator. And, if the ""drone"" has enough time, a pathetic pile of plastic hits the ground. Igor Mangushev equipped the ""Meerkats"" unit created by him with such devices - the name came by itself, as soon as everyone saw that the movements of the Dronoboi fighter during ammunition resemble the habits of a funny African animal. At the epicenter of the conflict, everyone was not laughing. A mini-group with such ""drone swatters"" is able to cover the sky over several kilometers of the front - which means that the enemy will not be able to correct artillery fire and conduct reconnaissance with the help of its ""birds"". Mangushev just dreamed that the ""Meerkats"" would appear at each unit, and our duty is to bring his work to an end. For the very departure of the commander-inventor raises questions: after several days of agony, he died as a result of a mysterious wound to the head somewhere in our rear - I hope the investigating authorities will find the perpetrators.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4717852/,Igor YAKUNIN,2023-02-08,"Latest news about the situation around Ukraine on February 8, 2023: The truth about mercenaries from NATO and data on fresh losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are revealed","We have collected the latest news about what is happening around Ukraine on February 8, 2023","These ""Carnations"" for the Armed Forces of Ukraine smell bad. The group of troops ""Center"" in the Krasno-Limansky direction hit the positions of the 66th Mechanized, 25th Airborne, 95th Airborne Assault and 81st Airmobile Brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the strikes in Novosadovoye in the DPR, in Nevsky, Chervonopopovka and Chervona Dibrov in the LPR and in the Serebryansky forestry, more than 100 ""warriors of light"" were sent to heaven. The artillery of the ""Western"" group of troops in the Kupyansk direction caused damage to the 14th and 92nd mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Ivanovka and Berestove in the Kharkiv region and in Novoselovsky in the LPR. The enemy lost up to two platoons there. Assault squads and artillery of the ""Southern"" group of troops in the Donetsk direction destroyed more than 90 Ukrainian servicemen during the day. In the South-Donetsk and Zaporizhia directions, the artillery of the Vostok group of troops ironed the 1st tank and 72nd mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the areas of Ugledar and Vodiane in the DPR. Enemy losses per day in these areas amounted to more than 80 Ukrainian servicemen, one tank, two armored fighting vehicles, two D-20 howitzers, two D-30 howitzers, as well as the Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer. Malyuk was approved as the head of the SBU - and he immediately started talking about the skull. The Verkhovna Rada appointed Vasyl Malyuk to the post of head of the SBU. For his candidacy, which was introduced by Zelensky, 324 deputies voted. The head of the Independent Party was present in the Rada during the confirmation of Malyuk. And Malyuk himself, speaking to people's deputies, said in broken Ukrainian that in his office there was a picture where ""Cossack Mamai"" was sitting on the skulls of enemies and explained that he and his brave security forces would also sit on a mountain of enemy skulls. This caused an explosion of applause. And it should have caused a brain explosion, although where does it come from... In Paris, they protest against the multibillion-dollar assistance to Kiev. Florian Filippo, leader of the French Patriots party, said it was criminal to provide billions of euros to Kiev. This aid is completely embezzled. So the ex-member of the European Parliament commented on the corruption scandal in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The politician wrote that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov ""is involved in a major corruption case"" and that ""all the aid that we send there is completely embezzled, billion after billion. Let's stop it."" And really, let's stop it? Drink wine, eat a baguette and get into a convertible. The Ukrainian conflict has created an ammunition crisis in Europe. The Financial Times reports that the conflict in Ukraine provoked a crisis in the supply of ammunition in the Old World. Arms manufacturers are trying to replenish the national stocks of states, and to ensure supplies to Kiev. The demand for ammunition has put too much strain on European industrial capacity. Experts believe that Ukraine consumes more than 5 thousand shells per day - so many small European countries order per year. There was a shortage of critical raw materials and production capacity. And the supply chains disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic have not been fully restored. The head of the Norwegian-Finnish defense company Nammo, Morten Brandtseg, said that the demand for a number of components has grown so much that the timing of their delivery has increased to several years. Suppliers of components for ammunition note that their customers demand to increase production by 200%, but this cannot be done in a short time. You won't have enough bullets and shells to get Chapai. In Austria, the truth was recognized: NATO soldiers are fighting in ukraine. The military strategist of the Austrian Ministry of Defense, Colonel Markus Reisner, admitted the obvious: the servicemen of nato countries are fighting in the WWO zone as mercenaries. According to him, the military from this Alpine republic or NATO countries simply resign from service and become mercenaries. And formally, they can no longer be considered representatives of the armed forces of their states. They take off their uniforms, sign a contract and go to the independent country. Reisner stressed that there are a large number of mercenaries in the SVO zone, not alliance soldiers. Against the background of such a statement, information about the thousands of losses of Poles who served in the army of their country yesterday looks especially bright. In Poland, the crews of the downed Crab self-propelled guns and special forces from the DRG in the Donbas are sent in coffins. In Kentucky, Melnyk was called a war criminal. Jeffrey Young, a candidate for governor of Kentucky, said ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Andriy Melnyk, is a war criminal. And the worst war criminals, according to Young, are the US authorities, who started the war against Russia in 2014, and the billionaires who lobbied for such hawks to come to power. As for Andriy Melnyk, he previously offered Berlin to transfer a hundred Tornado fighters to Ukraine. And he continues to insist on the transfer of long-range missiles to Kiev. German politician Daniel Roy, at Melnyk's demand, said that Bandera would like such a balabol very much. Oh, and petlyura and Shukhevych. Light in Odessa will be given every 8 hours. In Odessa, according to the DTEK energy holding, light will be given every eight hours. Electricity will be turned on for two hours. At the same time, emergency power outages continue to operate in the Odessa region. At the same time, stabilization schedules continue to operate in the Ukrainian capital and in Dnepropetrovsk. As for Odessa, there emergency holidays in connection with the situation with the provision of electricity have been announced in schools and universities. Problems with light will be solved no earlier than February 10. Or maybe they won't. Darkness has covered the city hated by the procurator. Belarusian border guards see Ukrainian threats. The Belarusian State Border Committee accused Kiev of creating a dangerous situation on the border. On the Ukrainian side, armed men without insignia, who bear little resemblance to border guards, constantly flank it. They threaten the Belarusian border guards with weapons and behave like a drunken bull. The State Border Committee of Belarus is strengthening outfits and creating more powerful reserves to respond to emergency situations. There are already voices about the need to build a fence on the border. But the Kiev regime itself is already sculpting concrete fences, copying its colleagues from Poland and Lithuania. Will Switzerland begin to supply weapons to Kiev. Reuters reports that Switzerland is close to abandoning neutrality in the issue of arms supplies to the independent country. The country is under pressure from banks, watches and cheeses after it rejected requests from Berlin and Copenhagen. But EU allies are demanding that the Alpine republic relax the ban on the re-export of weapons. So far, Switzerland cannot send weapons to the conflict zone. There is an embargo on sending weapons to both Kiev and Moscow. Interestingly, the opinions of Swiss parliamentarians on this issue are divided almost in half. Also, about half of voters are in favor of allowing the re-export of weapons to Ukraine , according to a Sotomo poll. Earlier, Swiss President Alan Bercet believed that his republic could lose confidence in itself as a neutral country due to the re-export of weapons to Kiev.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4717455/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-02-07,"Faith and miracles on the front lines: ""Our battalion was named after the saints - and there are no more heavy losses""","Special correspondent KP.RU Dmitry Steshin spoke about ""Orthodox battalions"" on a special operation","In the early morning, an inconspicuously dirty minibus left Donetsk. In the crew of the car was the monk Cyprian, Hero of the Soviet Union (read the interview with him on our website KP.RU), my old friend from the TV channel ""Spas"" Andrei Afanasyev and a very young priest of one of the Moscow churches, Father George. He will conduct short services in battalions, take communion and confess. In a photo lens case and pouches, he has everything he needs for worship. At the wheel is a lieutenant colonel with the call sign ""Japanese"", fighting from Slavyansk, one of the earthly patrons of this unusual phenomenon - ""Orthodox battalions"". We talk quietly, ""Japanese"" explains to me the essence of our mission. - From the beginning of the SVO, I was struck by this phenomenon - running from the front or ""five hundredths"". Some people were psychologically unprepared for combat. The authorities say: ""To their guardhouse""! I disagree, like, if so, there will be more people tomorrow. -Why. - They feed, warm and don't kill... And then, I started calling people out for ""preventative talk."" I talked for many hours and showed them my icons, which have been with me for the last 9 years. The ""Japanese"" reaches into his pocket and shows me a stack of tiny images, pulled over with a rubber band. - This one was in the certificate of the militiaman who gave me Strelkov, my patron George the Victorious. I sigh and say, ""I have the same stack, always with me."" I take out a zip bag from my backpack, in it a dozen samples and prayer books, worn, torn, soaked in rain and many times glued ... There are no atheists in the trenches. The ""Japanese"" continues. - I realized that these people have only fear, but no faith... Here near the Sands, after heavy fighting, one of the units completely lost its combat capability, the commander is under stress, cannot give a clear command. At the same time, he is a captain of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, two decades in danger. How so? And our entire hours-long conversation with him boiled down to faith. It strengthens. A believer sees his protection not only in a bulletproof vest and a helmet. - That captain has changed. - Yes, he didn't become the best commander, no. But he is no worse than others. He overcame the horror of the ""adaptation period"" of fighting. I then counted that I had conducted 129 conversations, in fact, small sermons. It became clear that clergy were needed on the front lines. And the military path of the units needs to be filled with meaning. Especially if there is a battle against Evil. The process of renaming the ""numbered"" battalions was spontaneous, which already indicates God's providence. The first to appear was the ""Rus"" battalion. The second is the Alexander Nevsky Battalion. 500 reservists held the so-called ""Donetsk Gate"", a problem area that the enemy viewed as the main entrance to the city. The battalion, for reinforcement, was given two special forces - ""to make a rustle"". It turned out, the enemy recorded activity, postponed the attack. In one of the battles, a special forces officer with the call sign ""Nevsky"" was killed. He looked like a legendary warrior prince. It was impossible to enroll Nevsky forever in the lists of the unit technically and bureaucratically. And then, in memory of him, the battalion was named after St. Alexander Nevsky. On his chevron are two rifles with an oblique ""St. Andrew's"" cross - the old ""three-line"" Mosin, the weapons of local reservists in the first months of the SVO and the new Russian Lobaev rifle, as a symbol of the future. And above this composition is the helmet of Alexander Nevsky. We are going to a battalion named after the not yet canonized new martyr, the warrior Yevgeny Rodionov, who refused to remove the cross and was brutally killed by militants in the first Chechen war. The battalion took Verkhnetoretskoye. In it, Father George must serve a prayer service and give communion to the soldiers. Father George is the first time in Donbass, I understand perfectly well that this is an Act. I feel his inner anxiety and take on the role of a guide, trying to explain to my father what is around us. We turn to Yasynuvataya, saying, ""Let's go along the military road."" This is the once gorgeous Horlivka-Donetsk highway, it is partially cut by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we are bypassing this section. Locals, who are not afraid, go to Horlivka here, others go around through Yenakiieve. Rarely, but on the highway, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are engaged in harassing fire. There is an area where the curb is lined with sandbags so that cars are not visible. Father George peers into the gray foggy distance and asks, ""How far is the enemy here?"" I shrug my shoulders, like, 3-5 kilometers, but with the weather we were lucky. We slip through the village of Krasny Partizan. Tell. - The first settlement recaptured from the enemy in 2015. On one side of the highway were dills, on the other - ours. Igor Bezler, the commander of the Gorlovka garrison, in 2014, when he went to Donetsk, brought cigarettes to the dryers, talked to them, then everything changed, of course. And I tell Father George a terrible story that plowed over me and still sits inside. - Out, in that clearing lay a bunch of dead dryers covered with the Ukrainian flag. The military ""KP"" took a picture of this, the most famous picture. And then a priest in semi-Catholic, semi-Orthodox robes, Uniate, came to pick up the dead. But none of the fighters wanted to help him... And then this priest shouted, ""Are you human or not human? Is there something human in you?"" - And fighters. - They spoke, one by one: ""You are not a priest, we have other priests"", ""you unwound my house"", ""you killed my sister""... The corpses were loaded, of course, but then for the first time I realized that what was happening was not politics, everything was in a different plane. The commander of the battalion named after Yevgeny Rodionov is called ""Sedoy"". He is gray-haired, on the front call signs just do not give. In the raspolag, in a half-ruined ice house, there is a chapel lovingly arranged in the former main entrance to the building. There are even walls lined with marble. The demons smelled something and with the beginning of this short service, shelling began, then our artillery joined in, planes arrived. The soldiers pressed against the walls and only the priest served in the center of this small hall, as if in nothing unprecedented, and I stood with my back to the wide wooden door. And with each ""arrival"" or ""exit"" of the shells, goosebumps the size of a fist ran down the neck. Father George remained to confess and commune the fighters, and ""Gray"" took Father Cyprian to Verkhnetoretskoye, to show the destroyed temple of Dmitry Solunsky and the places where the battalion is fighting. At the entrance to the village there is burned armor, and some rags remained from it, it is difficult to guess what kind of cars they were. ""Gray"" sighs. - There were only rifle battles in the village, and what you see now was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery over the past year. They just take and ""work out"" the village, square by square. There is no light, but people are still coming back. To the question of ""whether priests are needed on the front line,"" the battalion commander answers firmly: ""We do. It's hard for people, they would have comfort, a good conversation."" We drive on, to Gorlovka, to the scouts. There awaits us the front-line priest Father K. and the zampolit S. Batushka laughs: ""today we were at the positions, we took communion, so the zampolit kept the board!"". It is impossible to show Father K. – half of the diocese is still under the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and they are just waiting for an occasion to start, as I was told bluntly, the ""massacre of the Orthodox"". Zampolit begins to think aloud: ""Where would I take you to drink tea and talk? Maybe to the girls?"" Monk Cyprian throws up his hands. - Well, of course, where else to take the monk, only to the girls! Let's go soon. If there was no dirt under their feet, everyone would come down laughing. We arrive at some office, the ""girls"" have already made tea. Father Cyprian and Father K. quietly communicate on completely prosaic topics. For example, military chaplains are provided for by the state, but such a VUS is not a military specialty at all. What to do? And I'm guessing that the monk Cyprian, himself a retired colonel, is having a second task here– figuring out how to make the institution of the military priesthood work. I whisper to the zampolit and he says amazing things. The soldiers of the Gorlovka brigade could not take the enemy's stronghold, they rolled back, there were wounded, then they refused to attack at all and then the zampolit and the priest came to their original positions. We talked, took communion and a miracle of some kind – they took the midfielder without losses! I ask a painful question. - And is there mercy among the battles. And the zampolit tells me another story. - During the assault, the fighter herded two men into the dugout. On the threshold of the dugout lies our wounded. The dryers refuse to surrender, the wounded are, in fact, hostage to them. And then, the fighter swore to God that he would let go of the dills. Kombat scolded him, of course, but in his heart he understood that such oaths could not be broken. And our fighter was saved, this is the main thing. Our extreme point is the battalion named ""Forty Martyrs of Sebaste"", named after the Roman soldiers who converted to Christianity and suffered terrible torments for this. And the service itself in the raspolag resembled the services of the first Christians-catacombs. A dark inner corridor with a low ceiling and only dozens of yellow candles in the hands of warriors are warming. And very close to sighs with tears and tosses and turns a close Marinka, whom everyone can not take. Today, one of the sappers with the call sign ""Belorus"" performed a feat - he cleared the passage to the bank building for the assault groups. Due to the thick walls, it was one of the key supports of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and today it has fallen. ""Belarusian"" is terribly shy when, before the prayer service, the commander announces that he is attached to the award, and Father Cyprian presents him with an invaluable gift - a night vision device. The battalion is volunteer, people from Kazakhstan to Tver. The combat path is the hardest. ""And the losses were also heavy,"" kombat ""Engineer"" tells me. -Why. - The task must be completed. Remove a mine at any cost, put a mine at any cost. - Something has changed since the battalion adopted such a Christian name. - There are no heavy losses lately, but the guys still perform feats. We saw ""Belorus"" ourselves. And miracles happen. The driver of the engineering vehicle had to make a passage in the minefield for the tank. I mixed up the levers, yawned – I couldn't really explain anything later. Near Marinka, he drove just into the center of the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they then resented on the air - how they missed an armored bulldozer?.. - And you have the Order of Courage for that. - I cleared the road to Mariupol. There were regular mines and homemade ones, I went with the fighters. The evening turned to night and until the morning these guys would have no tasks. Father George confessed and gave communion in the battalion kitchen. Father Cyprian sat barrel-on a box of ammunition surrounded by canvas carriers with anti-tank mines and talked to a soldier on his knees. Thin neck, ears scattered, pink-transparent, like a seventh-grader. Not immediately, but I realized that this is today's hero of the battalion ""Belorus"". It was my turn. Father Cyprian, half affirmatively addressed me. - Dmitry, can I tell you something. I nodded. The warrior monk continued. - I can see in my eyes, you are passing everything through yourself, it's bad, it's hard. Do not suffer, God will manage everything as it should be... We all here know how to do it. And our strict and just God also knows everything. READ ALSO. Hero Monk Cyprian: We are in Ukraine by the will of God to stop evil.

Or rather, until Odessa, as it is now called by the maydowns who won in Ukraine. Since it was Odessa was a ""pearl by the sea"", and Odesa is increasingly sliding to the level of a farm on the site of Khadzhibeyevka, where the victorious Selyuks dictate their will to the population. They, with cackling and gnawing, demolished the monument to Catherine ii and her associates, and now they have reached the bread. Or rather, to khlib. Until recently, among odessans, pardon, Odesa residents, in addition to the traditional ""palyanytsi"", the baton ""Potemkinsky"" was also popular. But that's a mess. The figure of Potemkin, who was in the same sculptural composition, suffered the same fate. And the khlib remained untouched? Mess - decided the nezalezhniki and quickly renamed the loaf ""Potemkinsky"" in the same loaf, but now with a new name ""Hetmansky"". The recipe, according to rumors, remained the same. But if these selyuks thought that in this way they ""solved the problem"", then it is probably worth disappointing them. After all, Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin was not only the first commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet and its creator, Field Marshal General and Serene Prince, Governor-General of the Novorossiysk Territory, but also ... (drum roll!) He was the Great Hetman of the Ekaterinoslav and Black Sea Cossack troops, adding this title to the rest in 1790. That is, it turned out that the ""Hetman"" is not opposed to the ""Potemkinsky"", but only complements it with some nuances. It should have been called ""Presidential"" or ""Ataman"", for example. Potemkin was neither. But how much more work is to be done by Odessa bakers and local authorities, even just to imagine this amount of work is difficult. After all, ahead is the renaming of the baton ""Dyukovsky"", named so in honor of the associate of the Empress Governor-General of Novorossiya and Bessarabia Armand Emmanuel du Plessis Richelieu, who in common parlance received the nickname Luke in pre-revolutionary Odessa. Not in pre-Maidan, but in pre-revolutionary until 1917. What about the Vorontsovsky loaf? What kind of future does he have, if His Serene Highness Prince Mikhail Semenovich Vorontsov, is not just the Governor-General of the same lands, but also a Field Marshal General, Adjutant General, Chamberlain, and even the commander of the Russian Occupation Corps in France, that is, an obvious anti-Euphoria. And there is also a ""Lanzheronovsky"" loaf - and everyone knows that it is named not in honor of the seaside part of Odessa, but in honor of the hero of the war with Napoleon, the most former French emigrant (he fled from the then European Union, that's what!) General of the Infantry of the Russian Army Count Alexander Fedorovich Langeron. By the way, he is also the Governor-General of Novorossiya and Bessarabia. And this is the same part of the city of Odessa named in his honor. It is absolutely impossible to have any doublethink here, since portraits of all these historical figures are printed on the bags of bread. That is, the work ahead is an unfinished end. Even if the bread itself disappears, they still will not stop doing their fascinating work. And if we consider that the monuments to Vorontsov and Duke are still intact, then in general ... And if Langeron is renamed... Will the Odesa people have enough strength? Odessans would have had enough, but they would not have engaged in such nonsense. P.S.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4719763/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-02-11,Sociologists asked Germans what they would do in the event of an attack on the country. The answers surprised the Berlin authorities,"In Germany, they find out the reaction of the population in the event of a ""Russian invasion""","Anti-Russian hysteria can be supported and played out in many ways. In today's Germany, for example, sociologists decided to find out how the Germans would behave if ""Russia attacks Germany."" Of course, sociologists formulated the question a little differently: ""Suppose that a military attack on Germany is looming on the horizon, comparable to Russia's attack on Ukraine. What would you personally most likely do in such a situation?"" But here the fool understands what is at stake. Moreover, the question gives a direct and almost transparent hint – ""comparable to Russia's attack on Ukraine."" However, the results clearly disappointed the German authorities. It turned out that only about every tenth German is ready to fight with Russia. 5% answered that they would take up arms and go to war completely voluntarily, another 6% agreed to be called for national defense on mobilization. But every fourth German (24%) honestly said that they would try to leave the country with the greatest speed. Even more Citizens of Germany, every third (33%) explained that they will not build anywhere from the place and will try to adapt their lives under any government in the best way. Moreover, surprisingly, but characteristically, there is practically no difference in the answers between the former GDR and the FRG of the USSR period on a territorial basis. In total, 2,000 people from among the adult male population took part in the survey. One can, of course, rejoice that such pacifist sentiments reign among the German population. But here it is more appropriate to pay attention to another aspect of the survey. The very formulation of the question of the ""invasion of Russia"" is exclusively a propaganda cliché aimed at dumbing down the Germans. Another step in the opening of the next ""Overton windows"". In addition, a completely ahistorical propaganda cliché. If we recall history, the Russian troops took Berlin three times, but not once did Russia (including the Soviet Union) start those wars first. The first ""capture of Berlin"" occurred at the end of the Seven Years' War, which was initiated by King Frederick II of Prussia, when he suddenly invaded and occupied Saxony, allied with Russia, on August 28, 1756. As a result, on Oct. 9, 1760, Russian troops entered Berlin. The war, however, lasted another three years, but the emperor Paul III, who came to the Russian throne, saved him from the final defeat of Frederick II. The second coming of the Russians to Berlin happened in 1813. After Napoleon invaded Russia (by the way, more than 140 thousand Germans fought in Napoleon's army). As they say, ours just had to take Berlin on the way to Paris. There is no need to remind you a third time. In 1945, Hitler's attack with his armada on the USSR ended with the capture of Berlin, Hitler's suicide and the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. - We've walked, walked half the world with you. If necessary, we will repeat. Russia has neither the intention nor the desire to attack Germany. Russia has never attacked Germany, unlike the latter. Therefore, and given the policy pursued by the current Berlin, it would be much more correct, correct and legitimate for Germany to conduct a survey, asking the Germans a completely different question – whether they themselves are ready to go to Ukraine to participate in the war with Russia. However, it is clear that then the share of positive answers would become even more ridiculous. But, by the way, this does not mean that there is absolutely no threat to Germany. Germany's neighbor Poland has clearly demonstrated its growing ambitions in recent months. And, by the way, the Poles also did not forget about 1939. As long as NATO exists, they are unlikely to risk launching an aggression against a militarily weakened Germany, especially since first it is necessary to resolve the issue with the part of Ukraine that is called the Eastern Kres in Warsaw. But that's for now. I wonder if the same poll was conducted, but for the Poles, what the answers would be. LISTEN AS WELL. Why did the West disrupt the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (more)"

This passage in the interview looks so messy that it is a pleasure to quote it. ""I said to the Chancellor: Olaf, listen, we don't have enough missiles. I know you don't have any more, we also have an intelligence agency. I know you give us everything you have. And I don't know how, but he really managed to speed up the process of producing IRIS-T air defense systems,"" Zelensky explained the ""disposition"". It is clear that he wanted to praise Scholz for doing the impossible, trying to help Kiev as much as possible, but it turned out like this. Frank initiative confession about the work of Ukrainian agents on the territory of Germany with the sanction or on the direct instructions of the leadership of Nezalezhnaya. This is even worse than when the then head of our KGB, Bakatin, leaked to the Americans the system and installation scheme of special equipment that allowed the US Embassy in Moscow to be bugged. Because this misunderstanding is not even the head of the special service, but the head of state. It would be foolish to deny that the intelligence services of all countries of the world work in the maximum number of other states for which they have enough strength, personnel and funding. But no one will ever admit it, even if he is pinned to the wall. Except if they put it against that wall. But in this case, the situation reaps additional piquancy, since Ukraine itself has no money, it lives on what the West allocates to it. And it turns out that the same Germany itself finances, to one degree or another, Ukrainian agents working on its territory. It's really cooler than a non-commissioned officer's wife that ""carved herself out."" Even the famous scandal with the wiretapping of Angela Merkel's phone by AMERICAN intelligence agencies pales in comparison with this confession. There it was only about technical methods, and here is a confession in agent work (where among the agents there are probably German citizens recruited by Kiev in government or military structures, otherwise such information simply cannot be obtained). And then, it's one thing when the United States, the world's leading power in this regard, listens to you, and quite another when You have Ukrainian intelligence. Despite the fact that this wife is not childishly begging at every corner, but first of all – you yourself, everything that it can. Another revelation of Zelensky, in which he says that he is forcing the German Chancellor to certain actions, is also beautiful: ""I have to force Scholz to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not for us, but for Europeans."" Olaf, are you still funny? It's time to cry, not giggle. Germany has suffered so many humiliations over the past year that it is time to compare it with the shameful Treaty of Versailles. By the way, one of the consequences of which later was the coming to power of the paranoid and psychopathic Adolf Hitler, who skillfully played on these strings of the German soul. Consistent humiliations from the United States, most fully expressed in the undermining of Nord Streams, humiliations from the British, the French and an endless series of moral humiliations from the non-state of Ukraine make us assume that if not all Germans, then the head of their government is an incorrigible masochist who has few personal insults, and he feels real pleasure leading the locomotive of the European economy with an unflinching hand into the abyss. Together with the population entrusted to him. It is clear that it is high time for Zelensky to go to a narcological or psychiatric clinic. By the way, jokes have almost become a meme on the Web that during a speech to British parliamentarians, Voldemar set a world record for nose snorting, which is a characteristic sign of prolonged regular intake of substances that expand consciousness. A network of Belgian narcological clinics even launched an advertisement with Zelensky, obviously late. - Trempoline Rehabilitation Center invites you to give a motivational speech in front of our patients! – it is written in the ad on the sites. - Many in our clinic want to be like you. But maybe he should go there with his friend Olaf. And then, while Olaf is funny, and he giggles, it's time for the Germans to start crying. Scholz and Zelensky, although some already recall the wisdom that ""two morons are power,"" is actually one of the main threats to peace on the planet. One carries threats with his unsatisfied ambitions and vanity, and the second with his willingness to fulfill any whim. LISTEN AS WELL.

Reconnaissance recorded the movement of the enemy and transmitted their coordinates to the gunners. The Hyacinth guns worked accurately. Footage of video shooting with the use of a thermal imager states the complete elimination of a group of ""warriors of light"". As of the evening of February 10, of the four roads along which the garrison of Avdiivka was supplied, three were completely cut. And the helmet of the pilot, which Zelensky gave in London, if it helps the defenders of Avdiivka to gain wings, then only for a flight to heaven. Or they are waiting for the horsemen of the Apocalypse. It became known how much a lucky ticket costs ""away from the front line"". The publication Strana.ua studied the system of extortion in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Tribute is collected from funeral payments to the relatives of the dead fighters. There are established prices for the buyback from sending to the front line. There are known schemes for obtaining ""combat"" payments by rear guards. Witnesses say: ""For 10-15 thousand hryvnias (300-400 dollars), a soldier or sergeant buys the opportunity not to be on the front line. For half of the ""combat"" allowance of 100 thousand hryvnia (2.7 thousand dollars) you can be listed on the front line, and can be listed on the second or third front lines. "" Vacation costs from half a thousand dollars. Faced with corruption, the military, after complaints to the authorities, receive threats against them and accusations of violating the charter. Well, what did you think: the defense of freedom and democracy requires sacrifices. The German Chancellor appealed to the leaders of the countries of the Old World with a demand to quickly transfer leopard 2 tanks to Kiev. Scholz believes that ""it will work, but it will not be easy."" Earlier, the Secretary General of the Social Democratic Party of Germany Kevin Kuenert said that after agreeing to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Germany's independent partners in the EU, they suddenly fell silent. And none of them have yet made any specific commitments. Well, how many times do you repeat: to promise is not to marry. Andrei Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel, said that in one of the civilian buildings in Chasov Yar, converted for military needs, there are fighters hanging out who talk exclusively in English. They are dressed in uniform without insignia and have small arms of the NATO model. And in fluent English, they report a desire to merge. ""Wild geese"" are a legitimate target for our aviation and artillery. And those who did not hide – we are not to blame. Alexander Shulgin, Russia's ambassador to the Netherlands and Russia's permanent representative to the OPCW, said Dutch lawyers were afraid to cooperate with Crimean museums in the case of ""Scythian gold."" This fear is because of EU sanctions. The liquid stool of Dutch crochet makers complicates the position of museums in the judicial process. Shulgin believes that there is still hope that the Supreme Court of the Kingdom will study the issue objectively and impartially. And he will overturn the verdict of the lower instance. The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in the case of ""Scythian gold"" is scheduled for September 15, 2023. Chickens are counted in autumn. Sanna Marin, the Prime Minister of Finland, did not rule out the possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine. According to politico, Helsinki believes that they should help Kiev in every possible way. And it is time for Suomi to ""discuss the supply of heavier weapons."" But only to do it after the Netherlands, Poland and France. There, the leaders have already reported on the hypothetical possibility of sending fighters to Ukraine. Again, the question arises: why 105 years ago Lenin released the Finnish outskirts of the Russian Empire for free bread. Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anushauskas said that Lithuania transfers Bofors L70 anti-aircraft systems to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In total, Vilnius will supply Kiev with 36 complexes. Lithuania has already trained 15 instructors who are ready to work in the independent country. Bofors L70 are capable, as the Balts believe, to successfully deal with drones. After such convincing support, Kiev's victory over the ""forces of evil"" is closer than ever. The Ukrainian military arrived in Brussels to learn how to fly underwater drones. Belgian Defense Minister Lyudivin Dedonder said that the training of Ukrainian drone masters takes place within the framework of the EU mission to provide military assistance to the independent country. Sent Cossacks will undergo training with underwater systems that Brussels provides to Kiev. The Cabinet of Ministers of Belgium last autumn approved the transfer to Ukraine of ten underwater drones manufactured by ECA Robotics Belgium. Such devices can detect all underwater threats: mines, spy equipment. That's just in what reservoir these farm supermen are going to apply their knowledge. Bloomberg reports that if the European Union decides to use frozen Russian assets to restore the independent, it will be necessary to oblige banks to report on their size. The agency claims that EU lawyers have found ""legal grounds"" for the temporary use of at least 33.8 billion euros from the frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia for the interests of Ukraine. Take out the finca - beat, for the bazaar - be responsible. Anatoly Kurtev, secretary of the City Council of Zaporizhia, wrote in his Telegram channel that the objects of the energy structure in the city were seriously damaged after the explosions on February 10. Within an hour, 17 strokes were recorded. He noted that this is the highest figure since February last year. And the head of the regional military administration of Kharkiv, Oleg Sinegubov, said that 10 explosions were heard in this city. And in Dnepropetrovsk it was very restless. Why? And all because Zelensky took the helmet of the best pilot of Ukraine to London. Such carelessness in these difficult days is unacceptable. LISTEN AS WELL.

This video, shot on a phone, flew around the entire Network, and then got on federal channels. And even became the reason for Russia's appeal to the UN. They used to wash something back. Captured Russian soldiers lying on the ground are shot to Nazi screams. Moreover, there were several shootings, as well as videos. On only one part of the face of the killer, but on the second shooting, he decided to pose with the corpses of the victims. Found it quickly. His name is Sergey Makarenko. He lives in Zhytomyr region in the village of Krasnobirka. This is not the first execution of our prisoners. There is only one reason why such acts are committed – the feeling of complete impunity and invulnerability. There is no doubt that if this bastard survives, he will still be caught, even in a dozen years. But our fighters are being killed right now. And here, in my opinion, there is one way out – asymmetrical, it is necessary to break the illusion of invulnerability of war criminals, right now, tomorrow. And it is probably easier to do this – to put Kalibr or any other product, simpler, directly into the gardens on this street in the village of Krasnobirka. It is only necessary to honestly explain - ""for what"", ""why"" and thanks to whom the inhabitants of this village experienced unpleasant moments.

And let's fly!",This opinion was expressed by KP.RU columnist Nikolai Varsegov,"The main Ukrainian beggar with the words ""Ne manzh pa sis zhur..., geben zi mir bitte..."" drove around Europe, begging for another handout. He did it so pitifully and picturesquely that the next old ladies there kissed his hands. But a special sensation was made by Zelensky in Westminster Hall, where his phrase about wings has already become a catchphrase. On that day, February 8, Zelensky had a cool arrival. Volodymyr came out to the public all shining with all the colors of the rainbow. He presented the British Parliament with a flight helmet - all that remained of the Ukrainian pilot and his old Soviet ""drying"". As, however, from all Ukrainian aviation. He went on to say, ""We have freedom, give us wings to protect it."" The audience applauded standing, understanding the word ""wings"" - the handout of combat aircraft. But what is ""freedom"" with the prefix ""Ukrainian""? Do they really not understand? Or just so amused by role-playing in patients at home for the feeble-minded. Ukrainian freedom is Odessa on May 2. In Ukraine, you can easily and freely kill, burn alive those who disagree with the current regime, and for this you will get nothing! Ask the dispersed old people of Kiev who came out to defend the monument to General Vatutin from demolition, ask them: what is Ukrainian freedom? They will answer you, approximately, as follows: Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin liberated Ukraine from fascism, for which he was killed by banderaites. And now the current Banderaites destroyed his monument. In Ukraine, only Bandera nationalists are free in their deeds. And anyone who disagrees with them will be beaten, this is at best, but more often - tortured to death. And therefore: if you want to become free in Ukraine, sign up for Bandera's members and crush any dissent in yourself. It is hard to imagine that European politicians do not understand this simple truth. It's as obvious as twice two. But why do they clap sweetly at Zelensky's words ""We have freedom..."" Okay there is the Western proletariat, it will not get to the bottom of the truths. He believes what he is told. But politicians have a duty to know the truth. I think they know that truth. But they are forced to play along with Zelensky and believe in Ukrainian ""freedom"" and even in such absurdity ""Ukraine protects not only itself, but also European democracy!"". They have to believe, as it were, because that's their job. And the man is weak. Well, imagine that Ursula von der Leyen one day takes and publicly says: ""Listen, Zelensky, you're kind of crazy. How tired I am of fooling around under you..."" And that's it, Ursula will fly away from his post as President of the European Commission. And Ursula has seven children! Grandchildren are already immeasurable. And you need to feed everyone. And other politicians have children too... Therefore, when Zelensky in Westminster Hall, flying into the astral consciousness, shouted Bandera's cry ""glory to Ukraine!"", politicians again enthusiastically clapped him. It seems that even the wings someone promised Zelensky. But not now. So I think: let them give him these wings, and then our army will definitely put him on a barrel of gunpowder. And let's fly! ...

What they say on the front lines","Russian troops in the Luhansk region mastered a new tactic - ""active defense"" - step by step moving forward. Military KP.RU Alexander Kots transfers from the combat zone","""It's noisier in Belgorod than here,"" a colleague phlegmatically remarks as we travel around Luhansk in search of housing. I ""wipe"" the blurred look and the slight dissonance really begins to catch my eye. I spent the previous two days in Belgorod, solving humanitarian issues. By tradition, before leaving for Donbas, the volunteer group ""Time to Help Together"" loaded my SUV in Moscow ""under the neck"" with the necessary devices for the advanced devices - barely rammed personal belongings. From several like-minded women, a huge group of almost 6 thousand people has grown over the year, which helps the front in several directions at once: things - refugees, medicine - hospitals, equipment and equipment - fighters. Together we had just completed the collection for one of the mobilized units, when they managed to pack my car with thermal imagers and copters with a ""bonus"". I ""stitched"" them in Belgorod, where the sounds of heavy artillery can be heard. A couple of times, the air defense system worked somewhere. And on the way to the border, the eye snatches ditches and concrete slabs. In general, life in the neighborhood with the enemy does not dispose to relaxation. ""Most have already adapted to the new circumstances and are trying to help the military in some way,"" a friend saw me off. - Children are still learning remotely - for safety reasons. And so a person gets used to everything. The closer to the administrative border with the LPR, the more concrete pillboxes. At each bridge there is a post with vigilantes from the locals. Traffic cops - in combat layout, with body armor, helmets-spheres and shortened Kalashnikovs. The border as such is no longer there, but the checkpoint remains. It still checks vehicles coming from and into the combat zone. - Humanitarian? - Just asked me at the checkpoint. And, having received an affirmative answer, they missed it. No matter how paradoxical it may sound, but in the same Lugansk, the breath of fighting is felt less acutely. Their bowl of artillery terror on the part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was drunk here in 2014-2015. This is what the front line moved away from the city means, which the residents of Donetsk have been dreaming of for the past year. However, Kiev may soon have ways to break this fragile calm in Luhansk. Ukraine is promised to give long-range missiles to the ""Haymars"" and then the situation in the capital of the LPR may change. The high-precision ammunition available to the enemy today reaches only the satellite cities of Lugansk - Alchevsk, Perevalsk. Not so long ago, Ukrainians cynically shelled a hospital in Novoaidar, killing 22 people - wounded soldiers and sick civilians. In the meantime, Lugansk is a rear city, in which, unlike Donetsk, there are no interruptions in water and electricity, hotels are packed for a month ahead, and rented housing is extremely difficult to find and expensive in the capital. A small house for the campaign 10 minutes from the center cost colleagues twice as much as I shot in the suburbs during the pandemic. And then landlords with prices did not hesitate. In stores, by the way, products are sometimes also more expensive than in Moscow - because of problems with logistics. After all, trucks are also checked at the checkpoint. But for connoisseurs of Western drinks, there is a Cola that has left Russia, imported from Belarus, and the Georgian Sprite. True, as soon as you leave Lugansk in the direction of Happiness, the ""landscape"" changes in contrast. And the closer to the front line, the more tangible its breathing is. In the direction of Kremennaya stretch ""Urals"" and ""KamAZ"" with infantry, BMPs, tanks. In the opposite direction, on tractors, the damaged equipment is evacuated to the rembats. Among all this cold iron, no-no, let the regular PAZik ""Lugansk-Kremennaya"" pass, behind the frozen windows of which fellow travelers are considered by civilian passengers. Despite the constant shelling, people continue to remain in their homes. There was confidence that the Kremlin enemy would no longer be able to capture. ""But khokhlu was 400 meters away from the city,"" my friend recalls the commander, meeting in a deep dugout near Kremennaya. - Then the 76th Airborne Division was transferred here very timely. Largely thanks to her, the position here was held. And then push them away. The situation here really changed after I was in this area of fighting in early December last year. It is clear that our military has become much more numerous, including those mobilized. Thanks to them, in fact, it was possible to stabilize the situation here. Yesterday's civilians today are performing tasks on the front lines with dignity. - Are we going to attack? - Without any hope of a frank answer, I ask my friend. There is a rumor in the Western press that in 10 days we will launch a large-scale offensive. Someone ties this to the news that the LPR is going to disable the mobile Internet service from the tariffs. And it is clearly cut down before some active actions. However, the truth is that there has been no mobile Internet in Luhansk since September. As turned off before the referendum, so hello. Therefore, it is quite logical to remove from the tariff a service that is not provided. ""And we're already advancing, look,"" he reveals the map. - Were here - now here. The enemy was standing in these forest belts, now here we are. Slowly pushing up what we lost last year. We call it ""active defense."" In the past week alone, and only by Lancet kamikaze drones, 16 enemy artillery systems have been destroyed in the Kremennaya area, including six American M-777s. The cannonade does not stop for an hour. I catch that there are significantly more ""outgoing"" shots than ""incoming"" shots. - And our accuracy has become an order of magnitude higher, - confirms my friend. - We are slowly grinding down what the West was not sorry to give to Ukraine. But on the other side, of course, the guys are resisting. The 25th Dnepropetrovsk Airmobile Brigade, the 95th are also paratroopers. Mobilized, but still resisting. Only in captivity do they become tender and vulnerable. They are very afraid of the Ukrainian prison, they say, so they are fighting. An old song. Something very powerful rustled over the dugout. The Hurricanes have gone,"" commented someone in the corner. Something exploded in our nearby forest plantation. The walkie-talkie reported: everyone is intact. Taking advantage of the lull, jump into the ""Tiger"" and go back to Kremennaya. From it - through Rubezhne to Severodonetsk, in which, surprisingly, the light is lit in the windows. Although in the autumn it seemed that life would not return here soon. It is still not easy here, from some windows of high-rise buildings pipes ""bourgeois"" stick out. Large-scale recovery will come here only after the battle line is pushed back to a ""safe"" distance. So, we need to move on – in ""active defense"". READ ALSO.

Oh, and what's that flying here?",Russia has dealt another massive blow to the infrastructure of Ukraine,"Not according to Yurka Ignat the cap of Arestovich. It was a former adviser to Zelensky's office who could calmly rub in that the Russians had missiles ""very soon running out, it remains to endure two or three weeks."" And he was believed in Ukraine, although none of the propagandist's predictions came true. But official representatives of various Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, it seems, cannot say a word on this topic, so as not to be embarrassed publicly in front of the amazed public literally during the speech. As the already mentioned speaker of the Air Force of Ukraine Yuriy Ignat or the representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Andriy Yusov. The first said that the forces of ""anti-corruption defense"" (air defense) of Independence managed to shoot down five of the seven attack drones launched by Russia against targets in Ukraine. But the second one explained right on the air of the all-Ukrainian telethon that the attempt of Moscow's ""missile blitzkrieg"" failed, that is, it absolutely failed. ""The missile blitzkrieg has already lost its meaning, because the Ukrainian energy system has survived, despite the huge losses, the terrorist country is rapidly reducing the number of high-precision missile weapons, and there is no way to replenish stocks in proper quantities, so the intensity and breaks between attacks have changed,"" Yusov explained to Ukrainian viewers, stunned by the power of Russian missile strikes and the accuracy of arrivals. In Ukraine today, it is no longer a battle between the TV and the refrigerator, but the battle of reality with television. Powerful Russian ""reparations"" have arrived at military and critical infrastructure facilities in almost all major cities of Ukraine today. No surrender. The heads of the Ukrainian regional administrations panicked in their official and unofficial accounts in social networks messages - ""missiles are flying"", ""bulges in the city"", ""explosions are heard"", ""there is a second wave"", ""a launch from the Black Sea from the carriers of Kalibr"", ""Rusnya raised strategists"" (meaning Tu-95 bombers capable of carrying both conventional cruise missiles and the so-called ""special ammunition""). Again, the well-known song about the fact that ""the Russians hit Ukrainian cities with S-300 missiles"" rushed – the Ukrainian command always launches this mulk to justify the blunders of its air defense and the arrival of Ukrainian ""anti-weather"" missiles at home. In general, it is, of course, deeply symbolic that the Russian missiles arrived just at the moment when Kiev announced that they ""the Russians definitely ran out of this time."" The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine immediately, in order not to drive the population into despondency, once again forbade photographing the results of arrivals and even reporting on specific objects that got this time. And reports of arrivals pour in like a cornucopia: Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kryvyi Rih (the small homeland of Zelensky), Lviv, Vinnitsa, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Pavlograd, Odessa, Mykolaiv, Kremenchuk, Kirovograd and so on. Moreover, in many cities, arrivals are not single. So, in Kharkov, for example, at least 10 explosions thundered. In the Zaporozhye region - at least 17 arrivals. In Kryvyi Rih, a rocket flew into the engine room of a local power plant and destroyed it to the point of impossibility of restoration. In Kiev, after arrivals, CHPP-5 stopped its work. In a number of cities, a series of repeated explosions from the second wave of missiles thundered. ""Ukrainian Railways"", having reported on arrivals in high-voltage infrastructure facilities, stopped electric trains and brought out diesel locomotives, announcing delays in transport communication. In Kiev and other cities, emergency emergency shutdowns of networks were immediately cut. What damage has been caused to the military and related energy and transport infrastructure of Ukraine will be calculated later. But it's clearly not a big deal. The Russian Defense Ministry modestly reported that ""the tasks set have been solved"" and ""the declared goals have been defeated."" And Ukrainian publics have already recorded more than 30 arrivals in different cities. I think that's a very modest estimate. The correct numbers that will pop up later should be larger. - Everyone has the right to express their emotions. But do those who ""like"" the arrivals understand that exactly the same thing can begin to happen at his home? – well-known Ukrainian blogger Anatoly Shariy was outraged by the Russian missile strike and even hinted: – You understand what will happen to Donetsk today. Something this son of a bitch was not so indignant when Ukraine bombed (and still continues) The Donbass, covering peaceful facilities and houses of ordinary citizens with its missiles and shells. So there it is, Shariy, what you explained. You already shoot regularly. And, by the way, as always, Russian missiles fly exclusively at military and critical infrastructure facilities. Arrivals in the residential sector and civilian casualties, as a rule, occur in two cases - either when the Ukrainian air defense still manages to shoot down a Russian missile over the residential sector, or when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile misses and hits a residential building, or even flies not there at all, but, for example, to Moldova. P.S. According to Ukrainian sources, as a result of missile strikes, arrivals in the Dnipro hydroelectric power station were recorded. Moreover, not along the dam, which is fraught with consequences for the civilian population in the event of its destruction, but directly along the station. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4718934/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-02-09,The steel fist of the Russian soldier squeezed Artemovsk. Secrets of the success of the winter offensive – details from the front line,Voenkor KP.RU Dmitry Steshin spoke about the situation near Artemovsk,"Soldiers of the private military company ""Wagner"" were waiting for me at the very hour when the roosters and Ukrainian gunners had not yet woken up. So early that there was no point in going to bed. The meeting place was somewhat familiar to me – the outskirts of the city of Pervomaisky, LPR. It is part of an absolutely fantastic agglomeration of industrial cities - Stakhanov-Alchevsk-Bryanka-Zorinsk-Irmino-Almaznoye. In size, it can be compared only with the Slavic-Kramatorsk agglomeration, which is not far from here. Satellites in these parts are silenced - navigators do not work, therefore, I drove from memory. In the summer of 2020, I was in Pervomaisk with a curious mission. We gathered rural communities living under the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and people, showing their passports with a trident, asked in front of the camera – why does Ukraine treat its citizens like this? I have recorded dozens of collective appeals for referral to the International Criminal Court. The case was accepted for consideration, and that was the end of it. Since then, Pervomaisk has suffered even more, as I immediately called it: ""a city with half of broken windows."" I did not think that the path to the front line would be so long, only later, I navigated the map and realized that we were driving around Bakhmut (Artemovsk) in a giant arc to jump out to its northern outskirts. In one of the villages, the car was changed to armor. I have been for many years, rolling on the armor will not cheer me up, especially since the thermometer in the car showed: ""minus 15"". I climbed into the troop compartment and landed on the triplex with the bullet trail. The brand new IFV roared and rushed to the front, so that I rolled along the bench. We drove very long and very fast, jumped open fields, huddled in forest plantations, sometimes moved with a natural ""snake"". I thought about one thing: ""if only the car at such speeds did not ""undress"". But, the mechvod knew his stuff. Already in Podgorny, I asked about the speed at which we walked - about 50 km / h. At least some guarantee that the car will not be ""loaded"", and such ""curtained"" cars with bright red burnt bodies, I saw through the triplex a lot. Maybe there were Ukropsky, maybe ours – everyone here knows how to use anti-tank guided missile systems, loves them and respects them. Another ""chip"" of this campaign, as well as the mass use of quadcopters. Understanding the state of a fighting formation is very simple – look at the boots. Here, most of the shoes were bought ""for their own"", very good and expensive brands. I was the only one in my rubber boots. On top of the clothes is also different - who is in the statutory pixel, who is in the ""slides"" - as it is convenient for whom. Almost all the weapons encountered by fighters with tuning are sights, butts-telescopes, single-point belts, DTK (muzzle brakes-compensators). About half of this beauty is trophies, which suggests that the unit is fighting and fighting successfully. I was shown the point from which it was possible to shoot Bakhmut. In the morning rays of the gentle winter sun, the blocks of high-rise buildings seemed sugary and even sparkled. But, in front of them, in the offensive line of these guys, lay a vast industrial zone. The most unpleasant object for our assault teams. We did not walk around the village - it does not matter in what condition the Armed Forces of Ukraine are, it arrives with different periodicity. And the village streets are still full of surprises, we, for example, crossed such a dense line of anti-tank mines planted in three rows. The hull of one mine was opened by a fragment, and a yellowish tol is visible. One of the fighters explained to me why the minefield had not been removed. - And the mines in two directions work, now on us, blocking the passage of someone else's armor into this part of the village. Little remains of the village and, judging by the fresh craters, it is covered constantly. All trees are cut like a razor, to the middle. On the roads are abandoned minibuses, on which the enemy moved and did not have time to go far. Those who could, left on foot - bakhmut is a stone's throw away. We dive into an inconspicuous house, its only warm room. Judging by the pungent smell of diesel, it was warmed up with a dropper stove. On the floor - dozens of packages with mineral water, kept warm so as not to freeze. The guys I spoke to were wearing masks, that's the custom in PMCs. The first interlocutor from Voronezh, 29 years old. - I volunteered in September. - Wait, it was the most unpleasant month, redeployment, we left the territories. - That's why I came. - You've been fighting for six months, you can compare. What has changed in our country during this time. - Artillery began to strike more accurately. - And the enemy has changed. - No, as they fled from us, they are running. The second interlocutor was older, ""Kropot"" fought in the Second Chechen, there is a military specialty and also from the ""autumn volunteers"". Embarrassed by his mask, I tell him that his portrait will be a hit of the number. - How the opponent feels. - I started shooting less often, according to my observations, it happened a month or two ago. In most cases, now the enemy retreats, puts banners - began to be lined with mines. Sometimes he rolls on us (counterattacks. – Author.). Ukrop aviation also recently does not work as before. I ask Kropot about plans for a peaceful life. - I'll get married, I'll finally have kids. I turn off the camera, Kropot gets up, takes off his mask, and declares. - Oh and it was hard now... It's easier to go to dill. Shows everyone in the crowd trembling fingers. I give him a bag of caramels with ginseng – everyone tastes, tastes, a little such joy. I take pictures of some ruined hut and at this moment, very close to it, the camera winces. They wave at me – it's time, the Dill artillery has started working. Again in the same order we leave - mad armor, then a car that seems to be an example of comfort, warmth and silence. I ask informally the officer who accompanies me: how does a private company manage to successfully advance? The officer pauses for a dozen seconds, pondering whether to give out a ""military secret"", although there is nothing secret in his words. -Planning. Then reconnaissance, then re-exploration, if necessary, double reconnaissance. Artillery knocks out identified firing points. In Podgorny, these were ""Kordy"" and ""Cliffs"" and ""Pturs"". Only then the assault. We are supported by our own aviation, but not from cabring (firing a helicopter from maximum distances of about 5 kilometers, so it is low-aim. - Author), but at point-blank range. That's all the secrets. As evidenced by the officer's words, our road is crossed by two helicopters of the ""alligator"" K-52, a dirty brown color. I do not have time to remove them, but my interlocutor consoles me - now another ""deuce"" will pass. It passed, but at a great distance from us. Then we cross a fresh line of defense, one, two... Concrete slabs go over the hills beyond the horizon, on high-rises DZOTs (wood-earth firing points. - Ed.), and trenches - company strongholds made according to the Charter. I wonder why? Are you stepping on? And anyway... You, I've heard, are forbidden to retreat, right. -So. Without an order, we do not retreat. But personally, my opinion is that it fights more calmly when there is such a line of defense behind you. In addition, it is mobile, it can be moved, and we will move it. THAT TIME. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are evacuating wounded NAT officers from Artemovsk. During the day, 2 Ukrainian planes were shot down. ""At high speeds, the enemy is trying to break through to Artemovsk (Bakhmut. - Ed.), to bring something and take out the wounded, but not privates, of course, but high-ranking and those from the NATO bloc. There are some there too... That is, ""Wagner"" and the units of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, which block Artemovsk, successfully conduct battles. Such a video report was recorded by the deputy commander of the 2nd Army Corps of the LPR, the commander of the special forces ""Akhmat"" Apti Alaudinov. And here is what a report on the morning of February 9 issued by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. - A MiG-29 fighter was shot down in the Yuzhnodonetsky direction by the Russian Aerospace Forces. - In the area of Kherson, a Su-25 attack aircraft is shot down by air defense. - In the Kupyansk, Krasnolimansky, Donetsk directions and in the area of Ugledar, the strikes of the groups of troops ""West"", ""Center"", ""South"" and ""East"" defeated the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - During the day, 9 nine ammunition depots were destroyed.

""New textbooks and audiobooks will displace from the shelves of the school library the propaganda materials of Ukrainian nationalists, who before the liberation of the territory by Russian troops, were actively imposed on children and teachers,"" said representatives of Rosgvardia, who attended the school lesson. The servicemen spent a class hour with schoolchildren, told schoolchildren about their service, wished them success in their studies. Schoolchildren wrote letters and drew drawings for the soldiers on the front line. In the library of the school, Rosgvardia soldiers seized books of Ukrainian nationalists, which they did not have time to throw away. Among them was the brochure ""Pan Bandera and I"", as well as ""Operation ATO"". Recall that in Ukraine, during the ""de-Russification of libraries"", 11 million books were destroyed. ""As of November last year, about 19 million copies of books were written off in public libraries, of which about 11 million are in Russian language,"" Yevgeniya Kravchuk, deputy head of the Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy, said in the Telegram channel of the Verkhovna Rada.

General De Gaulle and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher look up to this sabbath from heaven with amazement. However, the tragedian of the comedian will not offend ... The cases of the murder of the deputy mayor of Berdyansk Oleg Boyko and his wife, the murder of the deputy head of the traffic police Alexander Kolesnikov and the attempt on the commandant of the city Artem Bardin were solved. The perpetrators and accomplices of the murder have been identified. All the defendants turned out to be residents of Berdyansk. All scoundrels have been detained and are giving confessions. Russian security forces have identified the head of the Ukrainian DRG, which conducted five terrorist attacks in Berdyansk from August to October 2022. The crimes were committed on the instructions of an employee of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Pityukin, now living in Zaporozhye, and its resident Tatiana Omelyanenko, who lives in Poznan, Poland. Their faces are known, their ""feat"" is not forgotten. Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, said that the decision on the supply of combat fighters to Kiev will be made by the leadership of NATO, but so far there are serious disagreements among the members of the alliance on this issue. Morawiecki, in an interview with the newspaper Corriere della Sera, said: ""At the moment there is no agreement on this matter."" Earlier, the British edition of The Spectator said that Western countries do not dare to supply modern fighters to the Ukrainian Air Force because of the threat from Russian air defense systems and the unpreparedness of Ukrainian pilots for their operation. Yes, Tornado is not a toy for children. Artem Stepanenko, founder of Gardarika Experimental Design Bureau, said that a new uniform for the Russian military in the SVO zone will be ready in the coming days. The first batch of the form with the informal name ""semitsvet"" will soon be sent for acceptance. And they sew it according to the state defense order in the Yaroslavl region. Production started about a month ago. The bureau now employs up to fifty people. They can sew up to 5,000 sets every month. The summer uniform includes a tactical jacket, trousers, a combat shirt and a cap. Only Russian materials are used in sewing. Thank you, did not remember about the capital's ""fashion houses"". Politico reports that the US administration is preparing to fully provide personnel to the embassy in Ukraine by the summer. Journalists refer to the received documents of the State Department. The staff of the diplomatic mission in Kiev was previously ""sharply reduced"". Now Washington intends to ""fully staff the US Embassy in Ukraine."" But the publication clarifies that only the real situation in the Eastern European country ""will ultimately determine whether this goal will be achieved."" By the summer, you say? Maybe it's better to think about Lviv or Krakow. Lars Klingbeil, co-chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, advocated a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine. He noted that fewer and fewer residents of Germany approve of the provision of military assistance to Kiev. Klingbeil said: ""I am annoyed that the term 'diplomacy' is often despised in political debates. For me, military force and diplomacy are two sides of the same coin."" He is confident that it is necessary to promote diplomatic initiatives to resolve the conflict in Ukraine: ""This conflict is likely to be resolved not on the battlefield, but at the negotiating table."" The SPD co-chairman stressed: ""The German population is less and less accepting when we discuss the supply of main battle tanks immediately after armoured personnel carriers and fighter jets immediately after them."" He sings beautifully. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said that air defense systems shot down a dozen Ukrainian drones in the region during the day. In his telegram channel, the head of the region said: ""The air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Russia repelled another attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thanks to the professionalism of our defenders, another UAV was shot down over the Bryansk district."" Earlier, Bogomaz reported that at night nine Ukrainian drones attacked the Starodub municipal district of the region. These attacks were completely repulsed. There were no injuries or damage. In general, during the conduct of the SVO on the territory of the region, the Ukrainian side opened fire 272 times. At the same time, four people were killed, 22 were injured. President of SpaceX Gwynne Shotwell said that the American side has limited the use of Starlink satellites by Ukraine for military purposes. In particular, to control drones. She said: ""Starlink was never intended to be turned into a weapon."" Speaking about the use of Starlink services by Ukrainians to control drones, Shotwell said that the company has ways in which SpaceX can limit such use of Internet systems, which they did. And she added that the use of Starlink networks for Ukrainian drones for military purposes did not fall under the agreement between Kiev and SpaceX. But the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine so loudly announced the formation of companies of attack drone operators! They were planned to provide them with Starlink satellite communications. And then there's such a nuisance. What about ""worldwide support."" Andriy Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel, said that units of Ukrainian troops stationed in the Kremennaya area in the LPR are mining positions and preparing to retreat. According to him, Ukrainian fighters in preparation for the retreat are establishing various ""secrets"" in the area of the settlement.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4720495/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-02-13,The boiler for the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to boil: That's why we bite into Bakhmut and Ugledar,"The events of recent days have clearly outlined (or confirmed) the strategic plan of the ""battle for Donbass"" and all the fears of Kiev politicians and military. Military KP.RU Dmitry Steshin saw this battle with his own eyes from both sides.","The first, logical question is – what is Bakhmut (Artemovsk) here? It turns out that everything is interconnected. Back in early summer, when there was fighting in the Ugledar direction, I heard this opinion from the fighting officers: ""If only we did not have to storm Slavyansk and Kramatorsk head-on, we would get bogged down."" In fact, with the fall of Bakhmut, the enemy in the Donbas will have the last defensive node, the so-called ""Slavic-Kramatorsk agglomeration"". A long intestine of cities, towns and industrial zones, running in an arc from north to south. At this natural defensive line there were, as they say in Ukraine - fortifications, fortresses in the pre-field - Soledar, Bakhmut and many adjacent villages turned into defensive nodes. These villages, for the most part, have already been taken. Soledar fell, the capture of Bakhmut is a matter of the near future. According to reports from local residents and official statements by the Ukrainian authorities, since Monday, civilians who do not live in the city, volunteers and journalists have been denied access to Bakhmut. And all the roads leading to Bakhmut are either cut or shot through. There is no reason not to believe the locals. As recently as last week, wagnerian fighters storming Bakhmut from the north confirmed to the KP military commander that ""the enemy's artillery activity has noticeably decreased."" And the last foreign journalists who visited the city - from the British BBC, in their report noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to experience a shortage of ammunition even for small arms. The moment for the enemy is unpleasant, especially when the fighting began in the urban area. Under the circumstances, we can wait for the enemy to begin to withdraw to more reliable lines – that is, to the ""Slavyansko-Kramatorsk agglomeration"". But, there he has an unpleasant surprise prepared for him. Everyone remembers the sad history of the French defensive ""Maginot Line"", which the German Wehrmacht simply bypassed, did not hammer concrete fortifications head-on? This story hides the whole problem of such defensive lines – they can be circumvented, they are not intended for circular defense. Even fortresses created to fight in full encirclement always have weak spots where the walls are lower, the palisade is rotten, the fighters are cowardly and untrained. What can we say about the 100-kilometer intestine of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, accustomed to fighting only on one side, on the eastern. Kiev military and politicians have repeatedly stated that Kramatorsk and Slavyansk will become ""unbreakable strongholds on which the Moskal hordes will break."" Of course, if the ""Moskal hordes"" begin to storm them head-on, from the East. For a number of reasons, we won't do that. The first sign is a sharp intensification of fighting at Kremennaya, hanging over Slavyansk from the north. And the second sign is the beginning of the assault on Ugledar. It does not go easily and not everything smoothly, but no one has backed down. In this town - our chance to go from the south to the rear of the ""Slavyansko-Kramatorskaya"" group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because behind Ugledar there are no powerful Ukrainian defensive nodes, there are no big cities. Fields and a sparse grid of roads are nothing for the enemy to cling to. The second option is an intermediate result: to half or completely encircle the grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine standing near Donetsk and digging there for 9 years. The whole world knows the name of these towns and villages like Avdiivka and Marinka, from which Ukrainian troops have been shelling the capital of the DPR all this time. On weekends, ours applied the so-called ""product 305"" to Ugledar. The tallest structure of the town is the CHP pipe. The Armed Forces of Ukraine hung on it all possible means of observation - optics, thermal imagers, night vision devices. Ugledar is already on a hill, so from the pipe the enemy, in fact, controlled all approaches to the city and the entire offensive line. They tried to destroy the pipe with shells and even hit once, but it resisted. ""Product 305"" carries 25 kg. explosives and is launched from a helicopter at a distance of up to 14 kilometers. The means of objective control transmitted a sparse black and white picture (see the video on our website KP.RU) of the ""product"" hitting the top of the pipe, exactly through the electronic ""eyes"" and antennas. Now there is confidence that our Ugledar will not be left alone, they will take it and move on. Until the pincers clamp down on the last ""Bandera stronghold"" in the Donbas. LISTEN AS WELL.

Thank God no one was hurt. On the video footage you can clearly see how a black and ragged column of smoke broke out into the sky for 30-50 meters ... How did this infection end up at the Batumi coast. Most Georgian, Russian and Turkish military specialists agree on one thing - this ""horned death"" sailed from the Odessa coast, where the Ukrainians were densely covered with similar mines fairways. Such mines were installed on the so-called mine- and simply put, on cables at a certain depth. But during storms, mines were torn off the cables and they went on a ""free voyage"" throughout the Black Sea. Turkey began to ring alarm bells last summer when a black ball filled with 200 kilograms of TNT began to dangle near its shores. Further, Ukrainian mines torn off by a storm began to be noticed in the waters of Bulgaria and Romania. The Bulgarian authorities urged residents of the Black Sea regions to be more vigilant because of the danger of blowing up ships on Ukrainian sea mines: ""We ask the population in the areas of Dobrich, Varna and Burgas to be vigilant. If suspicious spherical objects are detected in the water or on the shore, we ask citizens to report the incident to the emergency number 112. "" And the turkish Navy command urged sailors to be more careful when entering the Black Sea and track drifting mines: ""It is important that all ships in the region establish careful monitoring of drifting mines. The detection of mine-like objects should be reported to the Main Rescue Coordination Centre."" Well, now here is Batumi. Our naval specialists believe that the currents of the Black Sea were inevitably to drag the Ukrainian mines torn from the anchor to the Batumi coast. And this is a threat not only to the beaches, but also to shipping in that region. And even more! The appearance of these ""walking"" mines is not excluded in the end in the Mediterranean Sea. Georgian and Turkish newspapers are already howling: ""The threat that has arisen is the result of negligent and absolutely rash activities of the armed forces of Ukraine!"" I asked the specialist in naval mines, Captain I Rank Vladimir Orlov, what trouble can bring people, ships or warships of this type ""horned death""? Here's what he said. - Actually, the Batumi people were very lucky!.. If it happened on a warm day on the beach, there could be up to a hundred corpses... Well, the steamer or barge would instantly go to the bottom. The ""horns"" of this mine are lead cups, inside of which there are glass ampoules with sulfuric acid. Upon contact with the hull of the ship, the lead crumpled, the ampoules broke, the acid leaked out and became an electrolyte in the galvanic cell. Well, the resulting electric current activated the detonators. And ba-bah... LISTEN AS WELL. Why did the West disrupt the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (more)"

An air alert was announced throughout Ukraine on February 14, 2023. The population is advised to remain in shelters. Acting head of the DPR Denis Pushilin reported on the battles for Paraskovievka, the capture of which will block the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Artemovsk. This is the last route of Ukrainian supplies to the city. Russian fighters shot down Ukrainian MiG-29 and Mi-8 in the DPR. Russian air defense systems also intercepted four HIMARS MLRS shells and destroyed seven Armed Forces drones. Russian troops killed more than 60 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donetsk direction. Also, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed a hangar with enemy military equipment."

Their determination, assertiveness and combat experience in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in the militia units of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics are highly appreciated. Our heroes thwarted the attacks and prevented the counteroffensives of the nationalists, for which they received state awards. But they do not serve for the sake of praise and awards. The servicemen are sure that the enemy has no chance of success, because Donbass and Russia are fighting for a just cause. ""Never despise your enemy, whatever he may be, and get to know his weapons, his way of acting and fighting.

And the warriors taught: ""Speed is necessary, but haste is harmful."" HE SHOWED TACTICAL SKILL IN BATTLE. Captain Sergey ZUBKO. ""During the offensive of Russian troops on a strategically important line, the unit under the command of Captain Sergei Zubkov broke through the defenses of the nationalists, entrenched itself in positions and held them until the approach of the main forces. The enemy, supported by mortar and artillery fire, attempted to dislodge Russian motorized riflemen from the occupied positions and twice counterattacked the area held by our servicemen. While on the defensive, Zubkov and his subordinates killed more than a dozen nationalists in close combat. In addition, during the battle, Sergei personally adjusted the fire of russian artillery on enemy positions, which forced the nationalists, having suffered losses, to retreat. The skillful management of the entrusted unit and the decisive actions of Captain Sergei Zubkov made it possible to fulfill the assigned combat mission and create conditions for the further successful advance of Russian troops.

In battle, Dmitry, having organized the camouflage of the fire correction post, competently determined the points of aiming and timely transmitted the coordinates of enemy objects. As a result of the retaliatory mortar fire, Monakhov came under enemy mortar fire. Being under heavy enemy fire, risking his life, Monakhov continued to adjust the artillery fire. As a result of the officer's professionalism, artillery strikes were carried out on enemy targets in a timely manner.

Ukrainian formations tried to counterattack the positions of the Russian army in the Krasno-Lyman direction. But they failed to break through our defensive positions. Having lost up to a battalion, the Armed Forces of Ukraine retreated to their original lines. In this area, well-equipped groups of up to ten people with modern means of communication and surveillance are also recorded, which are trying to commit sabotage. As a rule, unsuccessful. But they climb like cockroaches. The Armed Forces of Ukraine burn forests to stop the Armed Forces of the R. Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to set fire to the forest with incendiary ammunition in the area of the Serebryansky forestry. So they wanted to restrain the advance of Russian forces near Kremennaya. According to retired Lieutenant Colonel of the People's Militia of the LPR Andriy Marochko, in the area of serebryansky forestry, Ukrainian militants with the help of a combustible mixture and fallen timber, having calculated the direction of the wind, tried to set fire to the forest with tracer ammunition so that the fire would go to the positions of the Russian Armed Forces. But the snow that fell did not allow the enemy to carry out sabotage - and the fire simply went out. Bad raguli taught physics and chemistry. Pakistan sends Kiev shells for MLRS, and demands discounts on oil from Moscow. Islamabad sent Kiev 10,000 shells for use in the Grad MLRS. According to the Economic Times, the shells were sent from the port of Karachi in February and should arrive in Ukraine through the port of Emden in Germany by the end of the month. Despite the fact that Pakistan constantly demands that Russia reduce the price of oil supplied to the republic, this country continues to supply weapons and ammunition to the Kiev regime. In January alone, Pakistani military-industrial complex enterprises sent at least 50,000 rounds of ammunition through Karachi. But Allah is prescient, he sees everything. Musk will not allow Zelensky to fight using Starlin. The owner of SpaceX, billionaire Elon Musk, said that the Starlink satellite communication network is necessary to provide communications in Ukraine, but it should not be used for escalation, which could lead to a third world war. Musk said that Starlink is the communication basis of Ukraine. It is the only way to connect to the Internet on the front line. The rest are out of action. But the American tycoon is sure that no one can use it to escalate it. Earlier, SpaceX limited the access of military UAVs in Ukraine to the Starlink network, since the latter, ""was not developed in order to become a weapon."" Kiev's screeching can be heard even on Mars. Repin and Aivazovsky became Ukrainian artists. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York considered Ilya Repin and Ivan Aivazovsky Ukrainian artists. In the annotation to the painting ""Ship in the Moonlight"" by Aivazovsky, it is said that the author is a Ukrainian (actually a subject of the Russian Empire with Armenian roots). A similar statement is posted on the page with the painting ""Portrait of Vsevolod Mikhailovich Garshin"" by Repin. Earlier, the Metropolitan Museum of Art declared Arkhip Kuindzhi a Ukrainian artist. The reason is simple: Aivazovsky, Repin and Kuindzhi were born in the Russian Empire in Feodosia, Chuhuiv and Mariupol. Which were then Russian cities, and now for some reason they are referred to as Ukrainian cities. Yes, geography is not a royal science, and history will correct everyone. And yes - you will also be cured. In Enerhodar, a cache of weapons and ammunition was found near the AE. In Enerhodar, police officers together with Rosgvardia soldiers discovered a cache of assault rifles and grenades. The weapon was hidden in the garage of an ATO participant who escaped from Enerhodar on the right bank of the Dnieper. The Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Zaporizhzhya region reported: ""In one of the garage cooperatives of Enerhodar, the police of the Zaporozhye region, with the support of Rosgvardia soldiers, seized a large cache of weapons and ammunition. Three Kalashnikov assault rifles, four F-1 grenades, fifteen hundred rounds of 5.45 mm ammunition and the uniform of the Ukrainian military were found in the cabinets and the pit of the garage.""

He ""presented"" the adoption of a number of serious political and diplomatic decisions. So he said: ""There will be many important political signals, there will be decisions on sanctions, weapons, there will be symbols of unity, and this will happen at all levels."" And as soon as it from the high pressure on the brain from the epochality and secrecy of the future was not torn apart. The water pipeline to Donbass is being built at a rapid pace. More than 2600 military builders continue to lay a water pipeline from the Rostov region to the Donbass at a rapid pace. The Ministry of Defense of Russia reports: ""More than 2.6 thousand specialists of the military-construction complex of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and over one thousand units of equipment are involved around the clock in the construction of a new large water pipeline. It will connect the Rostov region and the DPR."" The new hydraulic structure will pass through the territory of the Rostov region and the Donetsk People's Republic to the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal. The capacity of the water pipeline will be up to 300 thousand cubic meters of water per day. Two strands of the main pipeline are being laid for 200 km each, pumping stations, power substations and water storage facilities for 10 thousand cubic meters are being built. Now the builders are building a water intake unit on the Don, pumping stations for water transfer, strengthening the coastal zone, installing transformer substations and power lines. It's our water, it's our water conduit, who doesn't like it, it's on the way out. The former head of the CIA is upset by the signs of an offensive in the Donbass. David Petraeus, the former head of the CIA, said with alarm that Russia is intensively preparing for a new offensive in the Donbass. In an interview with RND, Petraeus noted that Russian units have enough soldiers, artillery, missiles, aircraft and tanks. The former head of the central intelligence agency stated: ""It seems that Russia is creating conditions for a new offensive in the Donbass. Maybe in the LPR.""

The soldiers of the cannon division of the 2nd Army Corps silently dress in their shabby ammunition and take turns going out to God's light. The sun's rays are just beginning to break through the trunks of ship's pines. There is virgin white snow all around, with no fresh car footprints or other signs of human presence. From above, the camp can not be seen - pipes from the bourgeois, sticking out of the ground are hardly visible from a drone in the middle of a green forest. 21st century, and nothing better than dugouts in the more often fortification science did not invent. Except for the concrete basements. But there aren't enough of them for everyone. ""Yes, we are also not bad here,"" the commander of the crew, Volodya, cheeres up in the morning frost. - Forest Tale! A dugout of three rolls, sand on top, a direct hit of a shell of 155 millimeters may not stand, but it's still try to find us to hit. - 155 is a NATO caliber. - And they don't have any Soviets left, they rarely come. The dugout is really solid, with two exits - in case one of them is overwhelmed by a close explosion. It feels like it's done wisely. The guys are working with 152mm Hyacinth guns. And this is not a weapon that quickly changes position. You have to work from one place. And live nearby. I asked about the NATO caliber for a reason. Why are there more and more destroyed Western equipment in combat reports now? Yes, because Kiev has less and less of its own. So all sorts of ""Caesars"" (French self-propelled howitzer. - Ed.) and ""three axes"" (American towed howitzer. - Ed.) become a routine of daily statistics. Although they work, as a rule, ""nomadic tools"". Do not stand in one place, move. And under the cover of their fire, small maneuver groups of the enemy are trying to wedge themselves into our defensive formations. And this happens along the entire line of the Svatovsky border, as well as in the direction of Lisichansk. But the way it turned out for them last year in the Kharkiv region, it does not work here now. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are stuck in the positions that are now held by the mobilized. And even catch the enemy on counterattacks, moving slowly forward. Guys call for breakfast. A mini-log cabin lined with pawpaw, two entrances again, a sign ""Place of eating"" - occasional checkers like that even in the forest everything was according to the Charter. For example, I came across a poster stuck to a tree in the forest about the dangers of alcohol, drugs and promiscuous sexual relations, which can easily turn into not only not the most heroic death, but even treason - both to the wife and the Motherland ... - Often have to settle down like this? - I go to the makeshift dining room, where hot tea is already poured. ""Well, as we change positions, we immediately settle down,"" the young gunners shrug their shoulders. - What a move is already on the account. - And you can't count, dozens of times since the beginning of the operation. - And each time you have to dig a new one. -Yes, it's all over again – cellars, cracks-shelters,"" says Volodya. - All for comfort. Well, security, of course. When we arrive at a new position, the first thing to do is immediately slit-shelter. And for ammunition, so that they were below ground level. So that in the event of arrival, fragments do not hurt and there is no rupture. Well, then we gradually start for ourselves – so that there is somewhere to live. - Covered. -Happened... 25-year-old Volodya has been fighting for the second year. And he volunteered. Friends went, and he — what's worse? Sam from Luhansk region. He worked for four years as a mechanic in a factory and decided to radically change his life. ""It's already a habit,"" he smiles. - You come home, you sit in the dismissal for a couple of days, it's somehow not the same, pulls back. On the couch, it happens, you sleep on a soft one, you do not get enough sleep, but here on the drawers, with a mattress - another thing or even, maybe, just a sleeping bag when. You get used to everything quickly. It depends, I think, on the person. Some still can't get used to it. And those who quickly, in a day, in two, new people come, instantly stabilize, somehow settle down. But I still want to quickly take my territory so that everything settles down. - Parents look at your new job. - It seems to me that any mother and father would not want their sons to fight somewhere. The artillery battery works in direct conjunction with reconnaissance. From the front line, the capabilities of the guns are requested, and if they reach the target, they transmit the coordinates. -Attention! Target - 1001-t, high-explosive fragmentation projectile, high-explosive fuze, first charge, sight 427. To the right of the main 0.79, level 30.0. Point, - commands the commander of the crew. - On readiness 4 shells runaway - fire. The shell goes into the barrel, followed by a cartridge case with a powder charge: ""Shot!. A hefty child picks up the flying smoking shell casing and throws it aside. I notice a ragged hole on the side of the bronik. - It was August 28, - says Sasha. - I was climbing a hillock, and suddenly - arrival. Wounded in the side, in the arm, shoulder hooked. And so now everything is fine. I want to say hello to mom, dad and girl Masha. Masha, if you hear this, I love you very much. Wait for me, I'll come and get married. Sasha met Masha on the Internet – through a dating site. They say it's a fashion trick now. And girls from all over Russia write to guys on the front lines. Sasha is from Anthracite, studied to be a mining master, has been fighting for a year and a half. Masha is from Moscow. In real life, we have never met, but is distance an obstacle to real feeling. - It was not terrible to return to the front line after two months of hospitalization. - At first, yes. But then I got used to it. It's got its guys here, it's all good now. Masha was very worried about me, she cried, she did not want me to come back here. Masha, everything will be fine, - Sasha says on camera. Having shot back, the crew again camouflages the gun, ""wrapping"" in a pine pawn, and disperses to their forest affairs.

""Therefore, I assess the behavior of this gentleman very, very negatively,"" The Ansa news agency quoted Berlusconi as saying. At the same time, Silvio said that ""if he were prime minister, he would not have gone to negotiations with Zelensky. Because we are witnessing the destruction of his country and the mass murder of his soldiers and civilians."" Apparently, in this way, the politician wanted to point out that military assistance to Kiev only prolongs the conflict. Berlusconi also proposed his own recipe for a settlement. In his opinion, ""to achieve peace, the American president should accept Zelensky and tell him: The Marshall Plan for the restoration of Ukraine (will be) at your disposal (only) after the end of the special operation."" This would imply a $6-7-8-9 trillion aid package, but on the condition that ""Mr. Zelensky orders a ceasefire, and we (the United States) from tomorrow will not give any more dollars and will not give more weapons."" The bold statements of the politician had the effect of an exploding bomb. The government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned his ""provocative statements"" and hastened to assure the ""partners"" that ""the support of Ukraine by the Italian government is firm and convinced.""

The head of the political council of the Ukrainian party ""Opposition Platform - For Life"" Viktor Medvedchuk told reporters that Kiev could fulfill the Minsk agreements without any difficulties.

""We very quickly exhausted our reserves, we do not have any spare capacities, and people do not understand this,"" the expert explained. The US military recalled that ""the Russians were able to increase production very quickly."" According to him, Europeans are concerned about this, because our defense industry is growing despite all the Western assistance to Ukraine with weapons. SWITZERLAND FROZE $19 BILLION. ROSSI DOLLARS. The total amount of frozen assets was calculated by journalists of the publication SonntagsZeitung. They turned out that one of the largest Swiss banks, Credit Suisse, closed access to $ 19 billion owned by Russia. This is more than a third of all our assets in this country. At the same time, the laws of the country expressly prohibit the transfer of money and property of one state to someone else. Frozen assets are unlikely to be received by Ukraine. Another thing is that we cannot dispose of them yet. BRITISH MILITARY INDUSTRY TO UKRAINE. The Daily Telegraph reported that London and Kiev are negotiating the construction of new factories in Ukraine, which will make British weapons. First of all, we are talking about artillery and armored vehicles. For the British defense industry, this project can become a gold mine. Unlike decommissioned armored cars, no one will transfer factories for free. The military industry is preparing to fulfill the order for money, and then earn further, supplying spare parts, materials and training workers. Britain wants to become the first country to deploy licensed military production in Ukraine. True, if the case goes well, then other states will easily want to participate in the business. MILITARY BASE IN MARIUPOL. The mayor of Mariupol, Oleg Morgun, said that the settlement is ready to host the base of the Black Sea Fleet. More precisely, not the city itself, but the Azov Shipyard. The enterprise was not so badly damaged during the siege. A floating dock with a carrying capacity of 15,000 tons has been preserved. It can receive ships 200 meters long and 25 meters wide. Before the special operation, the plant was ready to overhaul 120 vessels a year, as well as make any spare parts for them. - There are such machines, 12-meter ones, which sharpen the shafts. Even the guys saved it, lubricated it. The administrative buildings were looking, the docks were looking, the piers. Everyone walked around and looked. It will work, 100%, - said Oleg Morgun. SUMMARY OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. In the Krasno-Limansky direction, assault and army aviation, artillery and heavy flamethrower systems of the ""Center"" group of troops defeated the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. During the day, up to 100 Ukrainian servicemen, an infantry fighting vehicle, five armored fighting vehicles and an Acacia self-propelled howitzer were destroyed.

EUROPE HAS CONSCIOUSLY CROSSED THE LINE. This was acknowledged by the former European Commissioner for Enlargement, Entrepreneurship and Industry, Günther Verheugen. ""I am convinced that in 2008 the offer to Ukraine to become a member of NATO was deliberately and deliberately crossed the line, it was unacceptable for Russia because of its security interests,"" he said in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung.

We are demilitarizing Ukraine. So, the offensive will happen. And they're in a panic. - As it sounds. - Look at the front from right to left or from south to north - Soledar, Artemovsk. Below we descend – Ugledar. And above they went, to Kharkov - everywhere the activation of the front. - The front has leveled off. - We pushed the Nazi forces to a depth of 3 to 15 kilometers. The shelling of Donetsk has decreased. We pushed back their firing positions. The front is about to crack. - And it will crack. - Yes, and we will go on the offensive. And they are now rushing around and trying to explain that the damned Russians are now pouring into this Ukraine with all their might. Because: give Kiev tanks, missiles, planes. - This is the logic of the Western information mainstream. - Yes, and after all, the West will eventually give these long-range missiles. Including ATACMS. However, the quantity that they supply is unlikely to go into quality. - But it will create additional difficulties for us. –Creates. This is our overconsumption of ammunition, and the most terrible thing is the loss of our people. - As for the ATACMS missiles. - Expensive stuff. And how many will the States put them up? Well, let there be 50 such missiles. And Kiev will immediately make 50 launches – say, on objects in the Crimea. They will be shot down. The rockets will quickly run out. For Kiev, something else is important here: the transfer of hostilities to the territory of Russia - see the West, how can we?. - Of course, they can, but where will Europe find fighters for Zelensky. - None of the EU countries has stated directly what the fighters will give. They talk about tanks, ammunition, MLRS. All this works for the average European. - How do you see the coming offensive. - Kiev will not be taken yet. But the front near Ugledar and Artyomovsk will soon crack. This hole will form and leakage will begin. - The main task we have now is what. - Direction to Kramatorsk. This is the center of the southern grouping. With the fall of Kramatorsk, the operational stability of this defensive area decreases. That will allow us to maneuver. Directing the blows wherever we want. But the main blow, I think, will go to Nikolaev. - Why there. - We will level the front, seize the roads that will ensure the logistics of our troops and cut off the logistics of the Ukrainian troops. And the direction to Odessa will be fixed. Cut off access to the sea. And having reached the line Odessa - Nikolaev, and there, God willing, and to Kharkov, we will be able to dictate our terms. Later, Kiev will fall. - Now on the border, in Romania, huge NATO groups are concentrated. - Yes, there is the 101st U.S. Airborne Division, Screaming Eagles. There was not a single war in which they did not participate. But if they launch an offensive in Bessarabia and try to cut us off from Odessa, they will fall under the blows of our Aerospace Forces. And screaming eagles don't work without aviation. - But if they move NATO aircraft there. - Gentlemen, here's a black mark for you - we're starting a war. And if not, get out to the mother from here. - So Odessa should be in our minds. - I would very much not like Odessa to be stormed. My friends from Odessa write that they were pressed there terribly. They are afraid to go out on the streets, to use the phone. They go to the addresses, check. It is already worse than during the Nazi occupation. But odessans, when we get there, I think they will help us. - What Western supplies are you particularly afraid of. - I really don't want long-range missiles. Why? There is evidence that the West is trying to dump radioactive waste on Ukraine. Ukraine is ready to bury them in the ground for a pittance. But who will guarantee that they will not shove it all into the same ATACMS. - But these are not nuclear weapons. - Well, the rocket fell, broke, and all this contents splashed over the territory - and radioactive contamination of the area began. -For long. - From 10 to 100 years, this territory will be unsuitable for agricultural work. People will not be able to live there. Rivers and lakes, fish and other living creatures will suffer. - As for Zelensky's admission of unwillingness to comply with the Minsk agreements. - Zelensky needed the entire territory of Ukraine. They needed the east of the country. It clearly smacked of the Croatian scenario – to wait, accumulate strength, and then destroy. LISTEN AS WELL.

The press service of the IC claims that the investigators received ""irrefutable information"" about Kiev's encouragement of mercenaries during hostilities in the country, which is prohibited by international norms. "" Data on the recruitment, training, participation of mercenaries in hostilities and the size of their remuneration, ranging from 30 to 100 thousand hryvnias, have been established,"" the official press service said, and it is also noted that the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in absentia brought charges against five members of the Georgian National Legion. In general, not bags of gold row. Two and a half thousand dollars a month as the upper limit of desires is even somehow pathetic for mercenaries. On the official website of the US Department of Justice, information appeared that the family of ex-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili paid almost a million dollars to an American law firm to lobby for the interests of the ""Tiflis prisoner"". And most of this money went as payment for the services of foreign luminaries in the field of medicine. A list of specialists and the amount of their fees is also given. So, in particular, the reward was received. - Psychiatrist Eric Goldsmith - $ 75.8 thousand - Gastroenterologist Stuart Finkel - $ 79 thousand - Neurologist Shaheen Emmanuel Lahan - $ 107.4 thousand - Orthopedic surgeon James Kobe - $ 2.9 thousand - Toxicologist David Smith - $ 11.2 thousand All these experts, as a copycat, said in court that Saakashvili is ""seriously ill and urgently needs to be transferred to one of the clinics outside georgia."" Which, however, did not help – the court left Saakashvili in a clinic in Tbilisi. Did Washington put a cross on Michiko? Or they simply decided that drug addiction at this stage is already irreversible. Norstat Eesti AS experts conducted a survey among Estonians on whether it is worth providing temporary protection to Ukrainian men who have fled their country. - Is it correct that Ukrainian men aged 18-60 can get temporary protection in Estonia? - that's how the only question was worded. 61% of respondents surveyed were categorically against the granting of such asylum. 26% gave the answer ""Yes"" or ""Rather yes"". Another 13% answered ""Probably not"" or found it difficult to give an answer. In general, only every fourth Estonian was for granting such asylum. Which is quite logical – the more Ukrainians hide in Estonia and other countries, the faster it will be the turn of the Estonians themselves to go to war. And they don't want that either. ""Mr. Putin again wants to use energy as a weapon,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said at a briefing after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Russia would voluntarily reduce oil production by 500,000 barrels per day in March, but would not sell oil to those countries and companies that directly or indirectly adhere to the ""price ceiling"" set by the West for Russian energy. By the way, after Novak's statement about the reduction of production in the Russian Federation, oil prices went up, which is unlikely to upset the OPEC countries, with which Washington plans to hold negotiations. And Mr. Kirby, apparently, like other sanctions, does not consider the ""price ceiling"" to be a kind of economic weapon. After all, this is different, it is necessary to understand. US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Bonnie Jenkins said that the United States is ""extremely interested"" in resuming negotiations with Russia on the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms (START). ""The United States is extremely interested in resuming contacts with Russia in order to return to the negotiating table on strategic stability and resume inspections,"" Jenkins shared with the press and added that Washington intends to ""explore ways"" to return Moscow to the start-start dialogue in the near future. Tricky guys – they need not so much the Treaty itself, but the ability to inspect Russian nuclear facilities in conditions when Washington supports Kiev with almost all the weapons in its arsenal. If America wants something from us, then simple logic dictates that Russia does not need what Washington needs. German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock, in an interview with journalists of the Tagesspiegel newspaper, called it a mistake to say that Europe is ""waging war against Russia."" Recall that this statement was made by her in January at the PACE session, when she called on all European countries not to look for those responsible in their ranks and not to engage in self-digging, but to do everything together as much as possible for Ukraine. ""There is a saying: ""Only he who does not live is not mistaken,"" she explained the fallacy of her statement and explained that it is important for her to show people that foreign policy is not an abstract concept, but is directly related to their lives."" This statement was made in response to accusations that she had made a real international scandal with her words, and calls to resign. Once I told the truth, and then I had to repent. - In one of the Texas private zoos for only $ 4.9 offer to take a picture with a living Zelensky. True, this is not the president of Ukraine, but a rhesus macaque 4 years old, which weighs 14 pounds. If Zelensky were swapped, Ukraine would clearly benefit. - Deputy Finance Minister of Russia Vladimir Kolychev said that the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in 2023 will bring the share of the euro in the National Welfare Fund (NWF) to zero, and only gold, yuan and rubles will remain in it. - Putin awarded the medal ""For Courage"" to the assistant driver, who helped to remove part of the burning train from the Crimean bridge after the terrorist attack. - In connection with the expiration of the contract in March, the Estonian Social Insurance Board and homeowners in Estonia decided to resettle Ukrainian refugees to live on ferries. - The international rating agency Moody's downgraded the sovereign rating of Ukraine from ""Caa3"" to ""Ca"". This rating means that debt obligations are ""likely in default, or very close to it."" Meanwhile, Ukraine has again requested external funding. - The Ministry of Sports of Lithuania reported that a group of 35 countries, including the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France, advocated the non-admission of Russians to the 2024 Olympics. It is noteworthy that the International Olympic Charter states in black and white that the interference of governments and states in the Olympic movement is categorically unacceptable. For which there is, roughly speaking, a ""ban"". But in these countries, it seems, everyone is illiterate and cannot read. - In the Kherson region from 18 p.m. to 6 a.m., a mandatory mode of blackout was introduced.

Even the German Die Welt is already writing about this. According to the publication, Zelensky, being in Brussels, distributed to the heads of government leaflets with a list of weapons that Ukraine wants to receive from each specific state. ""Ukrainians know better than heads of state and government what anyone has in stock,"" a senior EU official told reporters. ""They know exactly what they need and know what and who they need to ask for. I guess they're informed and they have contacts. One can, of course, proudly boast, as Zelensky did in front of the press, of his own intelligence. That's just not all such as Olaf from Germany. In addition, if Kiev has a real capable agent in a couple of states, this does not mean that there is one in 30 NATO countries that, by initiative or duty, intend to supply Zelensky with certain weapons. Moreover, this is simply unrealistic, even if in the foreign agents of Ukrainian intelligence not just two and a half thousand ordinary employees, as reported after the hacking of Ukrainian databases, but two and a half thousand geniuses, not inferior to Stirlitz. And, nevertheless, Zelensky has detailed and accurate data on the availability of specific weapons, and, with figures and in certain types of equipment. The question is where, if not from their agents. And the answer is very simple – from curators from the country that organized this NATO. The United States has all the information, and since the bet on Kiev has been made, and no one has canceled it, why not ""please the native man"" by providing him with a complete database on issues of interest to him. For this, however, from time to time he has to trade his face and voice another nonsense that these same curators slip to him. For example, Zelensky, speaking at the European Council, said that allegedly ""Ukrainian intelligence intercepted the plan of the Russian Federation to destroy the democratic order in Moldova."" - Recently, I spoke with the President of Moldova Maia Sandu and informed her about what happened to intercept our intelligence - a detailed Russian plan to destroy the political situation in Moldova. A Russian document that shows who, when and after what actions is going to break Moldova and the democratic order and establish their control over it,"" Zelensky said. ""Of course, I immediately warned of all these threats. Remember or not, something similar has already happened in this reality. Under President Poroshenko, Kiev with unprecedented fanfare presented in 2016 the disclosure of the ""Kremlin"" plan code-named ""Shatun"" about moscow's allegedly planned plot to carry out a coup d'état in Kiev. ""Shatun"" he turned out to be a complete pshik, a crude craft of Ukrainian masters of special propaganda, which sank into oblivion without any honor. The curators, if they appreciated Zelensky, could have leaked this information to him in some other form. At least for the reason that such documents never exist in the form of a single integral document, where everything is painted from point ""A"" to point ""Z"". But no one bothered. Zelensky was told to voice a ""legend"" about the plan, and he obediently did it. Like any ordinary puppet. And, apparently, such a plan for Moldova, but not in the form of such a report, but a set of special measures, really exists.

Somewhere in the sky, our copter was hanging out, although even without it it was clear that the enemy had taken up a defensive position in the city. The comrade seems to have spoken to himself. - Those who commanded the storming of Grozny, who have long been retired, will study anew. He was right – everything had to be learned. I remember how we occupied the district CHP and a giant oil mill with deposits of sunflower seeds - there were hundreds of tons of them there, they immediately caught fire and smoldered until the middle of summer, exuding for kilometers around the smell of childhood ... Behind them are the first city high-rise buildings, the Vostochny microdistrict. They were waiting for us. Luger's assault group crossed the open space in one throw and swept into the courtyards-wells under crossfire. We managed to pop into the entrance. No one knew that the guys had 17 days of fighting in full encirclement ahead. One of the fighters of this group, a month later, will tell me about this siege. - They supplied us by air, quadrocopters paved the ""Tyrolean road"" - on cables. In five-liter eggplants, ammunition, food, medicines were thrown. There were local people in the basement, 15 people, they were also given medicines. In response, our guys sent notes on pieces of wallpaper: ""Brothers, we are doing well, we are holding the defense at 360 degrees ..."". Several times the enemy tried to occupy the ""House of Luger"". He was a thorn, a wedge driven into Mariupol. Finally, it was possible to get a dozen corrected Krasnopol shells - they extinguished the main firing points of the enemy around the ""Luger house"" and the ""Azov men"" * (banned in the Russian Federation) fled. The Nazis deliberately did not let people out of Mariupol, turning them into a ""human shield"". I saw these ""humanitarian corridors"" that were cracked in Ukraine – there were shot cars, corpses lying on the asphalt – those who managed to jump out and tried to escape. On the side of the road lay the tiny body of a child. His parents did not want to bury him on the lawn in the city and took him with them on his last journey... All the courtyards and squares of Mariupol turned into cemeteries. The most unspeakable and terrible thing is when there are people left in the city that is being stormed! Their people waiting to be released. Without food, water, electricity, communication. Sick through and through. Many are wounded. The first local soldiers of the Vostok battalion were found in one of the high-rise buildings. They asked – How? How did you survive? Two families and a 10-year-old girl Arina. One of the women had a bullet wound, a sniper shot. The bullet went through without hitting vital organs. This is very rare. The commander of Vostok, Alexander Khodakovsky, tells these exhausted people: ""We will put a generator in the next entrance, we will throw a cable at you, there will be electricity."" Arina begins to clap her hands, ""Cartoons! I'll watch cartoons!"" All the hardest things in the city were ahead. ""There is a humanitarian catastrophe in the city,"" Former City Council deputy Konstantin Ivashchenko told me. He will then become the acting mayor of the city. I met him outside the hospital, where the living lay interspersed with the dead. Ukrainian authorities fled the city on February 26. Everything disappeared, cleaned up. I will never forget the old man who asked me for a sip of water, to drink pills. I handed him a bottle of mineral water, the old man turned back. - That's a gift. I never went to Mariupol again without loading the car with water and bread under the roof. The new authorities began to distribute humanitarian aid in the empty metro hypermarket. This place instantly became the center of attraction of the whole city. They issued SIM cards, formed teams of volunteers, opened a medical center and a legal service. The city was revived and restarted. And that, too, had to be learned. According to the same schemes, Severodonetsk and Lisichansk were revived. The same will have to be done in Bakhmut... Now we know how to bring life back to cities. It was the right move to drive the whole pack of ""defenders of the city"": ""Azov""*, marines, vsushniki, sbushniki and border guards into the dungeons of ""Azovstal"". And there they are bombed until they howl. How many lives of our fighters have been saved. I was at Azovstal on the very morning when the Azov sappers began to remove their own mines to clear the exit. It was a prisoner of war. They were still with guns. I was struck by one detail. They were well aware that we were different. That they will be fed, treated, will not be bullied. Our truck arrived at the place of surrender to take out the wounded. They were immediately taken to the hospitals of Donetsk, treated in the same way as our soldiers. Although in the Donbass they grumbled. Because by that time, vsUshniki and Nazis had already begun to post videos on the Internet with mockery of our prisoners. They shot through their knees, just finished off the recumbents... The whole of Ukraine seemed to enjoy these shootings of murders on camera. Even in the West, they whispered worriedly. And the VSUshniki did things that would not occur to a normal person: they took phones from the dead and called mothers and wives, joked and had fun. Even I got it. They wrote to my niece: ""Take your Steshin, his dogs chew."" I didn't have a connection for many hours and what the child went through, I don't even want to think. And he didn't ask. But, we couldn't discharge the prisoners from the people and behave the same way with them. Otherwise, how are we different from them? And whose side is the truth on? And the prisoners knew this, distinguished between white and black... And then, on the day of delivery at Azovstal, they had a good mood and confidence that everything was over – they would live. One of the commanders of Azov*, with the call sign ""Aspid"", even showed me a text message from PrivatBank. For a month of sitting at Azovstal, he received almost 400 thousand rubles. I didn't see any remorse in his eyes... I was waiting for excesses. From our gloomy, often middle-aged men who have been fighting for the last 8-9 years. But, the men were silent. And in this silence it was possible to make out the satisfaction done and complete tranquility. Although, there were only 20 of us. And 2 machine guns. And there are almost 3,000 of them... Only one of the fighters shouted something to the ""Azov soldiers"". But they just turned their faces to the sides. I noticed this fighter. - They will, like the Fritz, restore the city. He disagreed. - Something else. We will do without their filthy hands. The only thing they did not expect from the prisoners of ""Mariupol"" was their native ""Heimers"", which in July will fly to the barracks of the zone in Yelenivka and in one fell swoop will destroy seven dozen ""Azov soldiers"" *. I hope Aspid also got this last text message from their independent. The last payment for the deed. * ""Azov"" is banned in the Russian Federation, recognized as a terrorist organization.

The efficiency of the calculation, which acts as an ideal clockwork mechanism, is striking: two minutes before the first shot, the D-20 howitzer crews received data from scouts who correct the fire with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles. The gunners instantly destroyed the enemy speedboat with three high-explosive fragmentation shells. The enemy landing force did not have time to reach the shore. ""The improved system of variable power propellant charges has increased the maximum range of the D-20 fragmentation shot to 17,410 meters, and the use of an active-rocket projectile makes it possible to bring the range to 24,000 meters,"" said Alexander, a senior battery officer. One of the latest innovations in the work with the D-30 was the use of an anti-tank projectile guided by a Krasnopol laser beam weighing 50 kilograms.

So, the truth is behind us.","The conversation of the military commander Alexander Kots with the legendary major, who even came to the Minister of Defense for the order in a full beard","""Look, this is the Barmaley you wrote about,"" my friend nodded in the direction of the officer. -Legend. The Ministry of Defense posted a video of his award in the midst of Internet battles, during which the initiative of individual staff commanders to bring the fighters on the front line to the statutory form was discussed in sharp and not very sharp terms. Someone thought that the beards that are released in the trenches interfere with the fulfillment of combat missions. So, they are subject to total shaving. However, a small video in which the Minister of Defense hangs the Order of Alexander Nevsky on a bearded major put an end to these battles. I also wrote in telegram then, saying that if the head of the defense department awards an officer with hair on his face, then it is politically immature to prohibit it in the combat zone. In general, in the last week that I spent in the forests of the Svatovsky Frontier, I did not hear a single complaint about forced shaving from bearded men. But my friends told me about the same major who turned out to be the commander of the special forces detachment Sergey Bogatyrev, the call sign ""Barmaley"". They say he used to have a longer beard. A multiple participant in the ""horse racing"" is an internal game of special forces from all over the country. After winning another competition, he was appointed company commander. SVO began in chernihiv region, where he received his first wound, refused long-term treatment and rehabilitation and, barely getting back on his feet, returned to his fighters. He participated in the liberation of Yampolovka, Torsky, Yampol. During the crossing of the Seversky Donets last year with his detachment, he came under artillery fire, was wounded again, but pulled out the castle companies on himself, withdrew the entire detachment, leaving neither wounded nor those who could be taken prisoner. Then the battles in Toshkovka, Lisichansk, the third wound ... And again escape from the medical unit to his own company: ""I have there ... person. How will I abandon them?"" After being awarded by the minister, he was on the front line a day later. And here he is in front of me, on one of the sections of the Svatovsky Frontier, an epic hero with a full beard and kind eyes. Even his last name is up to par. Just got off the front with him, and I decided to ask how they become real special forces. - Of course, he dreamed of becoming a military man since childhood? - We immediately switch to ""you"" - the situation disposes when together you fall under 120-millimeter mines. - You won't believe it, but, as my mother used to say, I still went to the potty, played soldiers and wanted to become a soldier. And this year - 33 years old, as I wanted to become an officer, and so it turned out. He studied at Suvorovsky, then at a military school and became. - You had an understanding or a premonition that sooner or later you would have to fight for real. - You probably can't say that, but I'll say even more: I wanted to. The army, which periodically does not conduct military operations, is degrading. Yes, there are losses, yes, problems, mistakes, but the winner is the one who corrects these mistakes first. - You had Syria, now SVO. There is a feeling that this is the conflict for which you have prepared yourself. - Yes, probably... Let's be honest, this is the biggest conflict after the Great Patriotic War. People who have passed through Both Afghanistan and Chechnya, they say: this is completely different. Something that we will always remember. - How do you motivate yourself. - Let's say you're a teenager. If you allow yourself to be offended in the yard, you will be crushed... Until you snap, so to speak, you don't give a to someone. Therefore, personally, I am even glad that such a decision has been made. Because, well, how long could this go on. - I'm explaining it for myself. As of February last year, an offensive group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was formed in the Donbas, and they would crush the Donbass. - I'm even sure of it. - And then on the courage they would go to the Crimea. And now we would get fighting on the peninsula. That is, we played ahead of the curve... - Exactly. If you know you're going to get punched in the teeth right now, hit first. Whoever strikes first, that will be the initiative. Same here. Everybody understood that. Now, both in Kiev and in the West, everyone admits that they were just dragging their feet and preparing. - Well prepared? How do you assess the enemy. -Honestly? I respect the enemy. Really. Yes, they also have problems, like everyone else. But they were really preparing to fight the Russians. And unfortunately, we probably didn't prepare to fight them... At the same time, we understand that everything there is not managed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their entire army cadre has already been knocked out. Mobilized by all. How many prisoners were there, we ask: ""Well, what were you taught in England?"" And he, except for ""they paid less there"", can not say anything more. What can the British teach? Yes, they are cunning, I agree, everyone is everywhere and always in charge, teasing. And to fight where they fought? There are warrior nations, and there are. - Ukrainians are warriors. - Unfortunately, yes. We are one people, no matter what they call themselves. I've met worthy warriors. When they fought with the paratroopers, when they were already taken prisoner, the wounded. You ask: why didn't you leave yesterday, they put so many of you here? The answer is simple: ""Would you leave?"" And there is nothing to say. But, as one priest told me, God is on our side. So we win, there are no options. My grandmother was engaged in patriotic education. Still alive, 94 years old. And she put me in the diaper that the Nazis were enemies. I was waiting for the moment to come when it would be necessary to defend the Motherland. And now we're doing that. Not somewhere out there, far away, but here, here it is - the Russian land. Russian people are the same here. It's just a shame that you often have to fight with the same Russians. - Maybe that's why progress is slow. - Some say: why was 300,000 mobilized and not killed? It's a shambles. Is someone's husband just going to lie down for taking some support? Why would my wife do that? She wants him to come back alive. Therefore, the main thing for the commander is to perform the task with the least losses. Nothing is more precious than human life. It must be protected, gradually knocking out the enemy. - How our mobilized behave. - The tankers from the regiment with whom we interact have really steel balls in their pants. Straight up handsome. In the infantry, there are units where the mobilized are even better than the contractors. Again, the main thing is the presence of platoon, company, battalion commanders. If the commander is a normal guy, even if he has never fought before, they will be fine. READ ALSO. ""We are Russian soldiers.

""In the documents that ended up in the hands of special forces soldiers, the heads of the regions of Ukraine are given detailed instructions for organizing work to discredit the Russian Federation in the eyes of the local population.

Ukrainian officials based their work on the manuals and reference books published under the editorship of USAID, as well as on the funds of this organization. Manuals advise officials to blame Russia and Russian citizens for all the troubles and troubles in their settlements. ""The materials of American manuals pushed for the decentralization of Ukraine, the purposeful incitement of interethnic hatred and hatred towards the Russian Federation, and in working with young people under the guise of ideas of gender equality, the values of the LGBT community were promoted,"" the study of specialists of the department says. The materials found by the Rosgvardeytsy were transferred to the competent authorities. The activity of the US agency USAID in the Donbas was confirmed in the administration of the LPR. Similar destructive materials were also found by USAID in youth and sports camps on the beach in 2008 in Georgia.

During the day, the enemy lost up to 70 fighters, five pickups, three cars and a self-propelled howitzer ""Gvozdika"". In the Krasno-Limansky direction, the ""Center"" group of troops struck in the areas of Terna and Krasny Liman in the DPR and in Stelmakhovka in the LPR. The Armed Forces of Ukraine lost up to 100 servicemen, three armored vehicles, two cars, a D-30 howitzer and a Grad MLRS installation. In the Donetsk direction, the ""Southern"" group of troops destroyed two platoons, four cars, four howitzers ""Msta-B"", the installation of MLRS ""Grad"". In the South Donetsk and Zaporizhia directions, the Vostok group of troops continued to exert pressure in the area of Ugledar in the DPR, in Levadne and in Orekhovo in the Zaporozhye region. Enemy losses per day amounted to 40 Ukrainian servicemen, one tank, three armored vehicles and two howitzers ""Msta-B"" and D-30. Representatives of the emergency services of the Kherson region reported: ""At night, an artillery strike was carried out on the parking lot of the equipment of one of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, located in the industrial area of Kherson. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine amounted to 8 units of automotive equipment, 12 people were killed and 5 were wounded. "" Also last day in the area of the village of Daryevka, a howitzer of the Ukrainian army D-30 with ammunition was destroyed, enemy losses amounted to five people killed and two wounded. According to retired Lieutenant Colonel Andriy Marochko, in state institutions and enterprises of Chasov Yar, the Kiev regime announced an evacuation, and all non-seriously injured are discharged from the hospital and sent to units. The population hastily leaves the city. And in one of the civilian buildings of Chasov Yar, converted for military needs, a large group of foreign mercenaries was recorded. They will stand here until the last Ukrainian. The sixth President of Ukraine gave the 10th separate mountain assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine the name ""Edelweiss"". In 1944, on the territory of Slovakia, the militants of ""Edelweiss"" eliminated the partisans. They were commanded by Sturmbannführer von Tün-Hohenestein. ""Edelweiss"" accepted the surrender of Lemberg (Lviv), where the Banderites staged a massacre of Jews. The dirty methods of these mountain shooters are noted in France, Poland, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg. Among the war crimes of Edelweiss are the killing of 153, 317 and 200 civilians in the Greek villages of Musiotitsa, Kommeno and Lingiades, respectively. Well, the Ukrainian 10th GSHB was disgraced during the ""defense of Mariupol"". So, unpretentiously, Zelensky is already openly recognizing fascism in Ukraine. Exxpress columnist Michael Koch said that the third world countries almost did not receive grain exported from the territory of Ukraine. Large volumes of Ukrainian wheat were fed to pigs in Spain. Koch wrote in an article for the Austrian edition: ""It is easy to explain such an outrage: Spain paid more money, and Kiev supplied grain to Madrid."" At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture of Turkey reported that only about 5% of the total volume of food exported from Ukraine as part of the ""grain deal"" was delivered to poor countries. And why can we no longer hear the indignant voices of those who accused Russia of provoking famine in the countries of Africa and Asia, preventing the export of self-made wheat from Odessa and Nikolaev. CNBC reported that the American companies Global Military Products and Northrop Grumman received a contract from the Pentagon for the production of artillery shells of 155 mm caliber for the supply of independent. The amount of the contract will be more than half a billion dollars. It is known that Ukraine spends Western-supplied artillery shells twice as fast as the United States and its allies produce them. In January 2023, the Pentagon raised its targets for the production of 155 mm shells to 90,000 per month. And all this flies towards the civilians of Donetsk and Horlivka, Kakhovka and Enerhodar. Arizona and Iowa think they're a long way from it all. The doctor of the Yaroslavl ""Shinnik"" Garegin Aghakhanyan reported on the nature of the injuries received by the players of the team in the fight, which was provoked by the players of the Ukrainian ""Minay"" in Turkey. The doctor talked about fractures in two Shinnik players, one had his cheekbone dissected, another had his ear dissected, and the third complained of rib pain. At the same time, no one was seriously injured, the treatment of the injured football players will be carried out as planned. Russians did not complain to the hospital. And the governor of the Yaroslavl region Mikhail Evraev said that the guys from the Yaroslavl club ""Shinnik"" correctly and harshly reacted to the attack of the players of ""Minay"". By the way, why do the players of this Transcarpathian club not defend their homeland, but sunbathe on the fields of Antalya and writhe from themselves van dammes. Adviser to the head of the DPR Denis Pushilin, Yan Gagin, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine use ambulances to deliver ammunition and combat groups to the front line in the Ugledar direction. Previously, similar actions of nationalists were noted in Volnovakha and Mariupol. According to Gagin, Kiev militants are now simply throwing failed cars in the fields. Earlier, Ukrainian sectarian Mykola Kum reported that the Ukrainian branch of the ""New Generation"" movement (the activity is recognized as undesirable in the Russian Federation) not only collects money to support the Ukrainian military, but also sends them explosives by ambulance thanks to the Red Cross. At the same time, Ukrainians are shelling Russian ambulances near Ugledar with aim, which is why there are losses among doctors. They measure themselves. In the Krasnolimansky direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are building a layered defense. Not only the military, but also civilian municipal enterprises from Kharkiv are involved in engineering work. The Armed Forces of Ukraine also use agricultural machinery of private farms. According to the former ambassador of the LPR to Russia Rodion Miroshnik, Krasny Liman should become the next point that Russian forces will liberate after establishing control over Seversk. You can't sit in the trenches. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at a meeting of the contact group on the defense of Ukraine in Brussels said that the urgent task of the West is to provide Kiev with air defense systems. Austin said: ""We know that Russia has a significant number of aircraft in service and great potential. And we need to do everything to provide Ukraine with as much air defense potential as possible."" Austin admitted that so far the air defense systems supplied to Kiev are not enough. Rome and Paris pledged to provide Zelensky with SAMP-T anti-aircraft systems. And the United States, in addition to the Patriot air defense system, promised advanced NASAMS surface-to-air missile systems. Promise more, louder, more often – Kiev has already spotted balloons in its sky, and it needs new anti-aircraft guns. LISTEN AS WELL.

And the corresponding symbolism is a stylized image of a mountain flower, well known to us from films about the war. This name and emblem were worn in the 1st Mountain Infantry Division of the Third Reich. By a strange coincidence, she fought not only in the North Caucasus, but also in the Donbass. She fought in such a way that some of the officers and soldiers of ""Edelweiss"", after the defeat of the Third Reich, landed in the dock in Nuremberg - for the crimes committed. And therein lies the first ominous sign. The problem of our ""non-brothers"" is that they drag on their banners with the tenacity of madmen the disgraced, nullified symbols of the ""Thousand-Year Reich"", which existed for only 12 years. Wherever you poke at this combination of household magic, there will be shame and surrender. But, our ""non-brothers in mind"" for some reason hope that this will help them win the next ""Crusade to the East"". Won't help. To quote a well-known demonologist and alchemist: ""The presence of a symbol and its description in a person does not mean that it is possible to work with the force that this symbol denotes, and the description describes."" It's even more complicated than that. Disgraced, nullified symbols work strictly in the opposite direction, they generate from the human will not action and creation, but entropy, decay, decay. I saw it with my own eyes, at Azovstal. The symbolism of the battalion, and then the regiment ""Azov"" was a rune called ""wolf hook"", the former symbol of the SS division ""Das Reich"". This panzer division advanced quite successfully during the Blitzkrieg of 1941 as part of Army Group Center, but six months later something went wrong. The division was frozen and beaten near Moscow, although it practically stopped in Khimki. Then it was battered near Rzhev so that the remnants had to be taken to France for reformation. Near Prokhorovka, on the Kursk arc, the Das Reich had to ride on captured equipment - its own ran out, 9 out of 10 tanks were destroyed in the division. In 1945, after an unsuccessful counteroffensive at Lake Balaton, the division surrendered to the Americans. I wonder what the ""Azov people"" thought, taking symbolism on their banners with such a shameful burden? They didn't think anything, but they smelled something. Therefore, there were not many ""Azov"" people who wanted to die under the banners with the ""wolf hook"". We sat in the bunkers at Azovstal, munched on Poltava stew in glass (excellent, by the way – author). When the stew ran out, they went out and surrendered. At the time of the surrender, I was on the front line in the 20th Corps of Azovstal (internal staff cartography, – author). I saw the first columns of surrendered men coming out. This lowered, shaking and mentally squeezed herd was an order of magnitude larger than those who tightened the encirclement ring around Azovstal. And all of us, who were then on the first line, experienced terrible anxiety – there were many dozens of times more! That's just to fight with honor"", the ""Azov"" were unable, despite the fact that everyone was wearing equipment and ammunition for hundreds of thousands of rubles - they counted on purpose. Fortunately, the ""non-brothers"" are completely devoid of learning ability and are not able to build the simplest logical connections. ""Edelweiss"" again began its combat path in Ukraine.

Yes, many guys are now actively working on the frontline, calling themselves military officers, I respect them ... - In general, not a war correspondent Sladkov. - I'm a reporter. Where they will send. - You recently said that the general battle of the Special Operation will be the battle for Odessa. And then it rained down about Odessa - from Kadyrov, from someone else ... Why? Ugledar is not taken from us, but we are talking about Odessa. It's not too early. - Well, we're talking about prospects. In general, I said that ""maybe"", ""maybe"", and immediately there were messages - so he said that we would take Odessa by Monday ... That's my personal reflection. Nothing more. We just need to somehow resolve the issue of the security of the Black Sea. And to do this, you will have to cut off from the sea the territory that is now called Ukraine. See what they're doing? Mined. Already in Batumi, mines explode... Launch underwater drones with explosives. In order for the Black Sea Fleet to live, we need to clear the coast. Any military company has its own general battles. There were Borodino, Stalingrad... Odessa in the mental sense, in the strategic sense, in the military sense is now a very important place. - Do you think we'll just be given it? In Romania, there are elite American units. Why are they there? Is it not so that if we go to Odessa, we will oppose it. And this is already hostilities with NATO. - Why does NATO need to fight with us? They will fight the Ukrainians, they will squeeze their country to the end. And the Ukrainians are the heaviest enemy. Maybe only the Germans in their highest stage of military development could compare with them. Americans aren't that good anymore. - The Germans had an iron discipline, many historians say that they are some of the best soldiers with whom we have ever had to fight. And the Ukrainians? They have the same approach as we do – with the Russian ""maybe"". - The Germans are technological. Yes, a powerful machine, powerful support, powerful minds in the headquarters. And Ukrainians just like us - they know how to stand to the last. Yes, you can press the nuclear button. The Americans also offered the French in 1954 to press the button as well. When as many as 14,000 French were captured in Vietnam. The French paused. And in Japan, the Americans pressed the button and, please, the war stopped. We can do that too. But we don't want to. - By the way, Norway recorded that our warships began to go on combat duty with tactical nuclear weapons. It's a show of strength or weakness. - Well, first of all, it's learning how to handle this kind of munition. And, of course, a show of force. Power is never funny. Power is never pathetic. Large battalions, as Napoleon said, are always right. We have large battalions – let them see. - I am interested in your opinion on the use of chemical weapons by Ukraine. Then they will show a video of the dropping of a shell from a Ukrainian drone with some crap. That poisoning of the Chechen general Alautdinov. What do you say. - One sentence. These ones can. -Why. - We once took a look at what was in the phone of the deceased Ukrainian soldier. There was a video of them opening grenades from RPG-7 and additionally stuffing them with balls. Well, what's it called? But ""yak I hate them"" is called. They have everything going on. If there is a nuclear bomb, they will drop it. I don't doubt it at all. - The people who participate in the SVO, our military, how do they feel about the fact that now the West will give Ukraine new tanks? There are fears about this or not. - We acquire a familiar opponent for us. I have been in the army for 10 years, for 10 years we have been learning to fight with these models of equipment. We studied them as a likely enemy. And now let's meet NATO tanks live. Well, the motivation is to see how much bonus money our businessmen immediately announce for such knocked out tanks. They even joke that the Ukrainians themselves will blow up these tanks, and we will send them money for it. LISTEN AS WELL.

Employees of the Federal Security Service of Russia detained in Rostov-on-Don a member of the nationalist regiment ""Azov""*, who came to the city under the guise of a refugee. The man conducted propaganda of a terrorist organization among young people. Ukrainian volunteer Ilchenko said that the archives of state institutions are being removed from Artemovsk.

Kiev can take such a step for the sake of a more effective defense operation, the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained. Detained by the FSB in the Moscow region, a Ukrainian saboteur became an agent of the SBU because of threats against his daughter. During the interrogation, the detainee stated that the Ukrainian military threatened his daughter, who lives in Vinnytsia, with physical violence. Russian troops destroyed eight sabotage groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyansk direction. In addition, the Russian Armed Forces defeated two brigades of the Ukrainian army. In Ukraine, a series of explosions was reported in the Kiev region. In the sky above the region, a ball with angular reflectors was noticed. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said Moscow was launching balloons containing radar angle reflectors to distract and deplete Ukraine's air defense system. Ukrainian media reported explosions in the city of Volchansk, Kharkiv region. An air raid alert has been declared in the region.

The group of troops ""Center"" in the Krasno-Limansky direction caused damage to the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Terny and Krasny Liman in the DPR, in Stelmakhovka in the LPR and in the Serebryansky forestry. An enemy company, three armored vehicles, a D-30 howitzer, and a Grad MLRS installation left this world. The fire of the artillery of the ""Western"" group of troops and our pilots in the Kupyansk direction adjusted down the number of the enemy in the areas of Novoselovsky in the LPR, in Dvurechna, Tabaevka, Peschanoye and Berestovoe of the Kharkiv region. Up to 70 ""warriors of light"", five pickups and a self-propelled howitzer ""Gvozdika"" were leveled. The ""southern"" group of troops in the Donetsk direction sent two Ukrainian platoons to the forefathers and four cars, four Msta-B howitzers and a Grad MLRS installation to scrap metal. And in the area of Avdiivka, a hangar with military equipment of the 110th mech of the brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was blown up. The group of troops ""East"" in the South-Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions hit the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Ugledar in the DPR, in Levadne and Orekhov in the Zaporozhye region. The enemy lost up to 40 servicemen, a tank, three armored vehicles and two howitzers ""Msta-B"" and D-30. Following the United States, balloons attacked the independent. Yuriy Ignat, a representative of the command of the Ukrainian air force (something like the Vatican fleet), notified the world about the appearance of self-propelled balloons over the territory. They were allegedly launched from Russian territory. Ukrainska Pravda, which quotes Ignat, reports that these are balloons with angular reflectors that ""move in air currents at a low speed"" and which are constantly observed by Ukrainian air defenses. Ignat pointed out that similar balloons, launched, according to the Ukrainian Air Force, from the territory of Russia, were recorded in the sky over the Dnipropetrovsk region on February 12. Air defense systems worked on them. If there were Raptors, they would lift them into the air. Well, thank God, and then everyone has already begun to worry: how so - there are balls over America, but not over Ukraine. Kiev drives the wave to the Zaporozhye AE. Volodymyr Rogov, a member of the main council of the zaporizhzhya region administration, said that the Kiev regime, with the help of Western media, is preparing a scenario to discredit the work of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. According to him, a case of increased risks for the nuclear power plant is beginning to be pumped. They will trumpet at all corners about the alleged inability of Russia to guarantee the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Ukraine will scream that the Russians are allegedly preparing an environmental catastrophe, since the low water level in the Kakhovka reservoir can lead to the failure of the reactor cooling system. Yeah, and Kiev will come – will it restore order? And the whips of heaven will open. Russian weapons that have distinguished themselves in the SVO are bought willingly by everyone. Alexander Mikheev, director general of Rosoboronexport, said that foreign countries, against the background of the special operation, began to show increased interest in the Iskander-E OTC, Su-35 and Su-57E fighters, Mi-171Sh and Ka-52E helicopters, as well as T-90M Proryv tanks. According to him, foreign partners are also interested in the Pantsir-S1 air defense system, the Viking air defense system, the Tor-type air defense system, the Igla-S and Verba MANPADS, the Orion-E and Orlan-10E drones, coastal missile systems, club-N and Club-S systems, tank support combat vehicles (BMPT), the TOS-1A heavy flamethrower system, guided ammunition for barrel artillery, as well as various electronic warfare equipment. That's right, not ""leopards"" with ""abrams"" to be interested, and not ""javelins"" with ""patriots"", if they burn with fire. In the area of Artemovsk VSUshniki I am increasingly running away. Andriy Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel, reports that near Artemovsk, Russian units record cases of panic flight of Ukrainian fighters from their positions. According to Marochko, the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""are chaotic, with obvious signs of panic."" On the firing lines, fighters abandon weapons and military equipment. And in Artemovsk itself, the appearance of mercenaries in a unified Western form, speaking English, French and Polish, was recorded. But the conversation with them will be brief. You don't need a lot of Russian words. Shinnik players beat Minay players in Turkey. In Antalya, Russian and Ukrainian football players fought in the Turkish hotel Royal Seginus. The conflict began the day before. Representatives of the Ukrainian club ""Minay"" demanded from the head of the team of yaroslavl ""Shinnik"" to sing the Ukrainian anthem. The Russian offered the Ukrainians to clarify the relationship one-on-one, but the hotel workers intervened. Next, several players of the Ukrainian club tried to beat the Shinnik player in the elevator, but yaroslavl stood up for a teammate. There was a massive brawl. Police and ambulances were called to the hotel. The Russians decided to change the hotel. Well, so that then no one screams that again these aggressive Russians offend small and defenseless Ukrainians. They should have scored a penalty before leaving. No ball. Kiev really wants to join the EU, but the EU does not really want Kiev. Bloomberg writes that the leadership of the independent requires the European Union to accelerate accession. But, according to the agency's observers, this leads to an escalation of the conflict without a real goal. And they specify: ""The idea of Ukraine's accession to the EU is not new. And in 2022, she was granted the status of a candidate on easier terms than usual. But from now on, the path to accession cannot quickly secure full membership."" Joining a block requires strict conditions to be met. And Kiev will not be able to fulfill them. Here's why: ""After the conflict, Ukraine will be a big poor country with a shattered economy, broken institutions, and a long history of corruption. Many of the EU members do not want to speed up the process. And some would prefer that idea be shelved."" Bloomberg concludes that it would be tactically unwise to promote the accession of Ukraine. Yes, yes, and reason is your middle name. Who was afraid of the ""Russian offensive on Odessa. Adviser to the head of the Odessa military administration, Sergei Bratchuk, panics: ""Today they are very actively discussing at different levels, including at the Munich Security Conference, the possibility of a Russian offensive on Odessa and the Odessa region. For example, the unrecognized Transnistria was mentioned."" Bratchuk raises panic in a video message in his telegram channel. Well, why spread rumors, if you can pack your bags and dump them on an inflatable raft in Romania. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers allowed the import of drones without inspection. On February 14, the Cabinet of Ministers of its own expanded the list of military and dual-use goods that can be imported into the country without obtaining permission from the State Export Control Service. The list, among other things, included UAVs, components for them and their controls, robots and controllers of robots specially designed for military use, fire control equipment, cameras, night and television vision devices, optical sights for weapons, as well as communications equipment."

It is noteworthy that people who pronounce or write, as if do not understand that a Nazi can be not only a German or an Italian, but also an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Russian, a Jew, and a representative of absolutely any nationality. Nevertheless, this argument is used every time Ukrainian soldiers with SS chevrons are caught in the frame. And we are talking not only about the Ukrainian SS division ""Galicia"", but also about hitler's elite German formations: ""Dead Head"", ""Das Reich"" and so on. By the way, Zelensky's team has even stopped glossing over these chevrons on vsUshniki in photos with Zelensky. But, hiding behind the above argument, the Western sponsors and allies of today's Kiev are trying to make it as if they do not see who is really in power in Kiev, and who supports them. Lie. They learned from Zelensky, or they did it themselves, it does not matter, but they lie without shame. Because it saves the face of people from polite society, not Nazi collaborators. The former head of the Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense (DIA) of the United States, the former White House adviser on national security, retired General Michael Fdinn published in his account an eloquent photo of the Ukrainian military holding two flags next to each other - the German Nazi with a swastika and the state of Ukraine. One photo showing two of these flags. Not the Donetsk resource or the Russian one, but belonging to such a high-ranking and very informed former head of a very cool American intelligence agency. Who also accompanied the photo with an explanatory inscription, as if specifically for the most stupid: ""So that you understand who we are arming."" Even more amazing news came from Germany from one of the military training grounds, where the Ukrainian military, brought to Germany for training, seize German Leopard-2 tanks. There, the local command had to hang a very specific announcement addressed specifically to these Ukrainians. - Dear students from Ukraine! - The ad says in black and white. – We draw your attention to the fact that in Germany for the demonstration of swastikas or other symbols associated with fascism (SS signs), you can get a punishment of up to three years in prison or a large monetary fine. Ba-bah! that is, the Ukrainians who came to learn to drive and shoot from ""Leopards"" have already begun to draw swastikas, SS runes, began, as can be seen on the rollers, to ""throw zigs"" and behave as they are used to in Ukraine. Knowing that they should only start, and then, as in the anecdote about incestuous connections, ""the whole village will die"", one can assume with a high degree of certainty that if they are not stopped, then soon the entire base and the entire range will be covered with swastikas and SS runes. Ukrainians rejoice from the bottom of their hearts that they ended up where Hitler's tanks moved to the Soviet Union, including Ukraine. They imagine themselves as ""real Aryans"", not wanting to understand that in Germany this is a taboo, a sign of bad taste and even a criminal act. And the Germans are worried about them, they say, they will imprison unreasonable people for this. You'll come home and draw what you want. At the same time, everyone understands that zigging is not the case when ""I want to go to prison, not to the front."" This essence of the Ukrainian cadaver makes its way even through the German armor. Not today's Germans, but today's Ukrainians are the spiritual heirs of Hitler's SS, punishers and executioners. It is not enough for today's Ukrainians that tanks and armored personnel carriers with the same crosses will travel around their country as 80 years ago. They need, to the point of convulsion, they still want to have the emblems of those same Nazis on them. And today's Germans know this very well, but they are uncomfortable admitting this. Therefore, they turn away, shamefully averting their eyes so as not to see. And they are trying to appease the Nazi spirit of the VSUshniki with modest and obscene announcements like this. And what if it helps. After all, the authorities explained to them that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, as well as Nazism in its modern variation, because their president is a Jew. And the Germans used to believe and obey their superiors. READ ALSO.

In this weather, drones do not fly, which means that it is possible to get to the front edge with minimal risk. Which I took advantage of, going to the trenches of a unit consisting of mobilized and volunteers. About 30 minutes drive along forest roads on an armored vehicle ""Tiger"", then - several kilometers on foot along narrow forest belts that ""cut"" the fields shot through. You walk along a well-trodden path, and when you come to the extreme dugout, behind which there is only a field with enemy positions on the ""other bank"", two tanks fly up nearby and begin to aim something a few hundred meters along the front. Whistling and explosion in the forest belt. Where I walked just 5 minutes ago. Tanks don't pay any attention to the mine: ""Well, you try to get into the tank with a mortar. It should be very lucky,"" the officer standing next to him phlegmatically comments from the height of his three wounds. The Seven-Twos begin to methodically loop behind the field. Another whistle and the mine explodes a little to the side, 50 meters from us. The desire to continue shooting at such moments dissipates like black smoke from the ""hundred-and-twenty"" gone into the unfrozen ground. We slide together into the dugout, which shakes slightly from both the close breaks and the work of the tanks. In the twilight sit bearded fighters, whose age is difficult to determine and because of the vegetation on the face and lack of light. There is no statutory gloss, fresh clapboard and stretched blankets on the beds. Instead, there are boxes of shells with mattresses and sleeping bags thrown over them. Minimalism as it is. There is not even a stove here - so as not to attract enemy thermal imagers. Only in the corners are trench candles burning. And the guys have been living like this for months now. At the same time, they do not lose either the presence of mind or a sense of humor. - We just know we're here until the melt (until the snow melts off- jarg). All the boys know this, and everyone is ready for it, - explains the most experienced with the call sign ""Old Man"". We pass the time for dugout conversations. - How are you with the salary, with the equipment? - I ""include"" a member of the Presidential Human Rights Council. - On uniforms, on equipment everything is there.

Previously, he worked at the factory as a foreman, foreman. And he fought in the ""First Chechen War"". Only, he says, the nature of the fighting is completely different. - You mostly don't see the enemy here. New means of reconnaissance. Upgrading all these appliances to take our lives. ""Teplyaks"" (thermal imagers, - ed.), ""night lights"" (night vision devices - ed.). Like you're sitting in a dugout, and some stove is working - they see you, they fly to you. Therefore, we do not sink anything so that we are not visible. - Well, how do you warm up. -Nohow. Trench candles, hot tea. On the front, the quieter you behave, the less you shine upstairs, the less you fly. It's that simple. - How many are you already fighting. -Fight? To be honest, all my life - then with women, then with someone else. Here the boys are some 4 months, who 3, who 2. Someone got sick, of course, there are losses – both 200 and 300. It doesn't happen without it. - Casualties from artillery mostly. - Mostly yes. But we have more or less. In our battalion, the order is good. Basically, losses from artillery and non-compliance with some rules: not to gather in a crowd, stealth of movement. ""Eyes"" (drone operator - ed.) draw, the same ""bird"" (copter - ed.) sees. She will not run for one, she saw a crowd - accordingly, the ""testicle"" will be thrown there. - How long does it take from the moment you see it to the blows. - You just saw it. How much time has passed and arrived? Well, a maximum of 10 minutes. They saw you, drew ""eyes"" from there, from the north – here's the result, guys. - And your mood is like that. - We're in the mood. We are invincible. We are Russian soldiers. If not us, then who? More precisely, we have a different motto. If no one, it's us. The enemy, by the way, with the rotation of people on the front, the work is set differently. They do not sit there in one place for more than two days. On almost every defensive midfielder, the personnel is changed every two days - so that they do not have time to be frightened if they are lucky enough to survive. And judging by the radio intercepts, the luck on the other side is not very good. Artillery and tank attacks disable dozens of people on the Svatovsky Frontier every day. At the same time, our tanks have learned to work not only with direct fire, but also from closed positions - a canopy. It turns out to be actually a sniper artillery piece. Which can also be used from a relatively safe distance. After saying goodbye to the guys, we overcome the way back with a clumsy jog. In the shower a little bit of a twist - I came and went, and the guys live in such conditions for months. And they hold the defense, or even go forward. Among the stormtroopers there are already real ""rexes"", which sometimes act better than the personnel contractors. Yes, take the same tank crew ""Flame"", which before my eyes dismantled the support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All three people are from the Bryansk region, the city of Klintsy, all are mobilized. - And how were you appointed tank commander? - I ask ""Flame"". ""Yes, together we conferred and I was entrusted with the post,"" the ordinary reserve shrugs. But he, by the way, served as a ""conscript"" in the Taman Division. Therefore, they mobilized according to the military registration specialty. What not everyone can boast of. - Listen, isn't it scary to get into this thing? - I ask the tanker, remembering how an hour and a half ago he was lined with 120-millimeter mines. - I don't even know. Sensations... You can't experience that on a civilian. And you can't put it into words to anyone. A tank is a force, a tank is a power, the driver-mechanic smiles. - Keep track of the goals you hit. - At first they did, now they are already confused. - On cars! - An officer commands. The men dive into their iron machines and, coughing diesels, leave for firing positions. Without unnecessary pathos and tremor. Everyday, like going to work. Although, why ""how"".... READ ALSO.

The western grouping of troops in the Kupyansk direction destroyed two platoons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, two armored vehicles, MLRS ""Grad"". The group of troops ""Center"" in the Krasno-Limansky direction reduced the number of enemies by 200 people killed and wounded, destroyed BMPs, five armored vehicles, Gvozdika self-propelled guns and a D-20 howitzer during the day. The southern grouping of troops in the Donetsk direction leveled up to 250 enemy fighters, three armored vehicles, howitzers D-20 and D-30 and the Polish self-propelled gun Krab. According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, in Pervomaisky in the DPR, the Buk-M1 air defense system was destroyed. In Marinka in the DPR, an ammunition depot of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was burned. The group of troops ""Vostok"" hit the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Ugledar and inflicted such losses on the enemy: up to 70 people killed and wounded, a tank, BMP, two armored vehicles, two D-30 howitzers and one D-20 howitzer. And in the area of Vodiane, two warehouses of the 72nd mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with ammunition and fuel for military equipment were broken. Well, near Khmelnitsky, a high-precision strike of our sea-based missiles leveled to the ground the point of deployment of a regiment of drones of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The sea god punished the petty heavenly demons for their pride. The punishers are hitting the Donetsk residents from the RSZ. On Sunday afternoon, the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired 40 MLRS missiles at the center of Donetsk in a few minutes. At least seven people were injured, said the mayor of the city Alexei Kulemzin. Residential buildings, a sports complex, buildings of a number of social institutions were damaged. An arrival was recorded in the building of the DPR Prosecutor General's Office, where smoke and fire arose as a result. As a result of the barbaric shelling, the largest library in the Donbas was also damaged. There is also destruction in the building of the student hostel in Donetsk. Near Poltava, Pushkin was overtaken by a terrible place. Near the school in the village of Belenchenkovka, Poltava region, a monument to Alexander Pushkin (the author of the poem ""Poltava"") was demolished. Next in line is a monument to General Pavel Korzun. The head of the department of culture and tourism of the Hadyach City Council, Larisa Trush, said that they allegedly wanted to ""move"" the sculpture of the great Russian poet to the Hadyach Museum of History and Local Lore. But... the construction technicians, because of their size, could not drive into the courtyard of the museum. And the monument was abandoned in the courtyard of the house of culture. If something will remain from Pushkin, petrified with amazement, as well as from the sculpture of Korzun, who died during the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazis, in the coming months, then the sculptural ""remains"" will be taken to the ""Park of the Soviet Period"", in the Sumy region. Ah, little Alexander Sergeevich betrayed Mazepa... The United States is afraid of military assistance to Moscow from Beijing. NBC reports that the White House is confident that China is providing ""non-lethal military assistance"" to Russia. Perhaps we are talking about the supply of military uniforms ""or even body armor."" The White House is alarmed that the Chinese side may ""consider the possibility of lethal assistance."" The alarm was expressed, in particular, by the head of the State Department, Anthony Blinken. He explained that by ""lethal assistance"" he means the supply of ""a number of products - from ammunition to the weapons themselves."" Jealous, Yankees. Kiev sees everywhere the poisoners of their ""warriors of light. In the Chernihiv region there was a mass poisoning of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After that, they were universally forbidden to accept food and water from local residents. A source in the Armed Forces of Ukraine told Ukrainian media that in early February, 40 fighters showed symptoms of acute poisoning. There was an embarrassment after the ""warriors of light"" ate the semi-finished products received from Chernihiv volunteers. Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian troops were forbidden to take water from local peasants in the Kharkiv region. They are also afraid that they will be poisoned. So that's it, you can bring lard from Uzhgorod, or something, and water from Truskavets. The conflict in Ukraine is global. British leader Rishi Sunak and US Vice President Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference voiced that the conflict in Ukraine is a global battle, the consequences of which are felt around the world, both in the field of energy and sovereignty. The prime minister and vice president condemned those countries that provide political or military support for Moscow's actions. They also discussed intensifying international efforts to help Ukraine ""ensure Kiev's victory"" and find a way to guarantee Ukraine's security in the long term. Restlessness in alliance with myopia is a terrible force. ""Daggers"" became large. Sergey Chemezov, the head of Rostec, said that the production of Kinzhal hypersonic missiles has increased in our country. On the air of the Zvezda Plus TV channel, he said that initially a large number of such ammunition was not required, but since the beginning of the SVO, their production has been steadily increasing. Chemezov said that Rostec produces huge volumes of products for the Ministry of Defense, for some items supplies have increased 50 times. As for the ""daggers"", the complex has already shown itself perfectly during the use in a special military operation in Ukraine to defeat ground, especially fortified targets. Why Ukrainian refugees were disappointed in Canada. More than one hundred thousand Ukrainians arrived in Canada under the program for refugees. But for many, it turned out to be a disappointment. Ukrainian media reported that some of the fugitives across the ocean were seduced by free tickets from Charitable Canadian Foundations. Others were lured by high ""lifts"" from the government. But refugees have to look for housing themselves – and this is difficult and expensive. Employers do not wait for newcomers from the country with open arms. One of the immigrants advised couples with small children not to come to Canada: ""And do not think to come if you do not know the language. You have a family, a child, a wife who does not plan to work. If you've settled in Europe somehow, sit there and don't go to Canada. Without a tongue, you will only be ""standing on a shovel.""

The Ukrainian leadership pinned special hopes on him. The head of Israeli diplomacy was expected to be. (a) Strongly condemn Rossi. b) will no less resolutely support Ukraine. c) agree to the supply of weapons from Israel to Kiev and announce them, first of all, about air defense and PR systems. d) announce the provision by Israel of a soft loan in the amount of at least 500 million US dollars. Kiev even went to a real scandal on the eve of the visit, announcing that if Cohen does not live up to the hopes placed on him, of course, from The Independent State, then let him not even count on a rendezvous and a photo shoot with Zelensky. And maybe not even come, for that matter. But Cohen arrived, went to Bucha and Babi Yar (it is noteworthy that the Israeli Foreign Minister drove along Stepan Bandera Avenue to the site of mass executions of Jews). Without the support of Kiev, of course, could not do. "" I came to say: Israel supports Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in difficult times - this phrase was the first thing That Cohen said when he stepped off the bandwagon of the train on which they came from Poland. But with everything else, somehow it didn't work out. Cohen did not live up to the hopes of Zelensky and the head of Ukrainian diplomacy Dmytro Kuleba. Even with credit. Apparently bargaining, it was announced that Israel was ready to provide loan guarantees for 200 million, moreover, for the targeted restoration of civilian infrastructure. Not a word of condemnation of Russia came out of Cohen's mouth, nor was a single promise made in the field of armaments. Not even the know-how invented in Kiev, which has so far worked flawlessly on high-ranking visitors from a well-fed and calm Europe, did not help. In the midst of negotiations between Kuleba and Cohen, an air raid siren sounded. This is a well-known invention of Zelensky's team. As soon as one of the high representatives arrives in Kiev, immediately he is led somewhere in the bomb shelter to the sounds of an air alarm, which, by coincidence, is necessarily nearby. And there are already local residents who accidentally sat there for at least a couple of hours waiting for distinguished guests and begin to tell them ""for life"" and ""Russia's aggression"". For Europeans, such sounds are adventures in themselves. The President of The Federal Republic of Germany fell for this bait, Charles Michel (or Josep Borrell), Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn and some others rushed to the bomb shelter under these sirens, although in none of the above cases were there any shelling in thoughts, and not that in reality. With Cohen, they decided to do the same trick, although no threat in reality was even close. But with the Israeli in Kiev clearly overreacted. Eli was born and raised in Israel, where such sirens sound almost on a daily basis, and children often play on the sidewalk to the explosions of downed or reaching the target of missiles. In addition, he managed to serve in the IDF, rising to the rank of major. All in all, this cheap operetta clearly had no effect on him. It is possible that deep in his soul he laughed at the naïve Ukrainians who decided to deceive him with the help of cunning. The wrong one was attacked. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4723264/,Andrey BARANOV,2023-02-19,Darkness and fear reign in Zelensky's bunker: Where the President of Ukraine is hiding,The Times journalist released a report on Zelensky's bunker,"The political editor of the British newspaper The Times, Caroline Wheeler, was allowed to go on an excursion to Zelensky's bunker in Kiev and made a very gloomy impression of this visit. The journalist titled her report bleakly - ""Inside Zelensky's bunker: no phones, no light, no sleep."" Of course, in its material there are enough familiar Western clichés, and conclusions are sometimes drawn on a dubious knowledge of realities. For example, Wheeler writes in the very first lines that on the day of her arrival, ""Kiev was subjected to the most intense blows, which apparently was the Kremlin's response to President Zelensky's tour of the UK and Europe, during which new promises of arms supplies and sanctions against Russia were received."" Probably, in her opinion, this is how military operations are carried out. But the journalist was able to notice many interesting details reflecting the oppressive atmosphere of the place where the current Ukrainian hetman lives. Sometimes parallels come to mind with another bunker in which the German Führer committed suicide, also trying to make Nazism a new religion. Here's what she writes. - The most striking thing that catches your eye when entering Bankova (the Ukrainian equivalent of Downing Street) is how dark it is inside. All curtains are drawn and the lights are off to reduce the threat that the building will become a target for air attacks or snipers. I thought darkness was a temporary measure due to the last raid, but I was told it was done on a permanent basis. As the guard escorted me through the vast corridors and up the grand staircase, I couldn't even see my legs and could only walk thanks to the flashlight on his phone. - Bank, a concrete block of offices, surrounded by a steel ring. Checkpoints with armed guards are located on every street surrounding the complex, and access is granted only to those who have the relevant documents. Civilian cars can't get close, and soldiers ask pedestrians for secret passwords that change daily - often meaningless phrases that would be difficult for Russians to pronounce (obviously, something like the notorious ""palyanitsa"", because only Russians will certainly break through the cordons, the British woman believes. - Ed.). ""Earlier in the day, security personnel picked me up at one of the checkpoints and drove me in a van through several more barriers before entering the courtyard through a huge metal gate. Inside, windows, doors and former grand staircases are littered with sandbags. Sitting in the waiting room, where the eerie twilight was still lit only by the light of the phone, I watched as military advisers in khaki uniforms fussily entered and exited the offices. Shortly thereafter, a soldier sitting nearby jumped to his feet. Others in the room also stretched out on the counter ""peacefully"" as Zelenskiy, who was easily recognizable by his small stature and signature black hoodie that read ""I am Ukrainian,"" walked through the hall accompanied by a group of advisers. Wheeler reports interesting details of Zelensky's stay in the bunker. At the beginning of the SVO, Ukrainian propagandists strongly denied reports that the president was hiding in a secluded place. It turned out to be so. The journalist reports. - According to one government source, the original plan was to stay underground for a week. But events outside forced a change of plan. Zelenskiy and his most senior aides have spent most of the two months living underground, periodically surfacing to the surface to reassure people he hasn't escaped. Those allowed to live alongside the president in an underground bunker had to sign a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting them from sharing any details about the bunker's interior or amenities. They weren't even allowed to talk about the food they ate. The complete inadequacy in which Zelensky's entourage resides can be said by the following passages from the report in The Times. - An isolated team below watched the fighting through their iPhones. A few hours after the start of the special operation, the guards turned off the lights when a shootout broke out around the government quarter (I wonder who is with whom. - Ed.) and issued bulletproof vests and assault rifles to Zelensky and a dozen of his assistants. - The head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Yermak was furious that hundreds of Russian singers, artists and influential people who support the SVO were free to travel around the West. Bankova was shocked when Philip Kirkorov, who has been described as ""Putin's favourite singer,"" attended a Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles this month. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4723152/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-02-19,"The latest news about the situation around Ukraine on February 19, 2023: The West is holding tanks, Ukrainian grain has reached only the Spanish pigs","We have collected the latest news about the situation around Ukraine on February 19, 2023","THE CHINESE HAVE THEIR OWN PRIDE. Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said Chinese airlines were taking an ""unfair advantage"" over European carriers because they had permission to fly over Russia. As a result, European airlines are forced to choose longer routes to Asia to fly around Russia due to sanctions, and the Chinese use shorter routes from Asia to Europe and vice versa. That reduces the flight time between Paris and, for example, Seoul by as much as three hours. And in such conditions, it is difficult for Europeans, to put it mildly, to compete with Chinese air carriers, which are chosen by passengers because of cheaper air tickets and less travel time. And who and because of what imposed such sanctions. ""NAFTOGAZ OF UKRAINE"" ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF GENERATORS AND ""BOURGEOIS. One of the monsters of the Ukrainian economy - the company ""Naftogaz of Ukraine"" - began to develop new market segments. She launched her own online store selling appliances and appliances for the home. In particular, the attention and wallets of buyers are offered gas boilers, power generators, batteries for autonomous power supply, cookers, tourist equipment, including sleeping bags, stoves and much more. All this on the site is called goods ""necessary to create home comfort"". Earlier, the company defaulted on Eurobonds, and its future is now in big question. In such conditions, it is sinful not to work out alternative ways of development or existence. And, judging by the proposed range, the company still has room to develop. For example, in terms of including primuses, kerosene, etc. in the assortment, tanks WILL BE. WE HAVE TO WAIT. Ben Wallace, who has already told Western journalists a lot about how the Ukrainians need to shoot more accurately from their artillery and save shells, as well as not wait for modern Western fighters, explained why Kiev's optimism about the rapid delivery of Western tanks is also inappropriate. - Problems have become apparent here. There is, however, a political solution, but many countries are discovering that their armies do not have serviceable tanks to supply. Politicians sent their military to warehouses, and they had to state that their tanks were either faulty or not repaired for supply to Ukraine, Wallace announced. That is, there will be tanks, but later. When is unknown. They'll tell you later. In the meantime, it is known that the Western tanks transferred to Ukraine in the near future will be enough to form about half of the battalion. And they promised at least a few brigades. But in Kiev, let them not be upset. The West also deceived Russia when it promised not to expand NATO to the east. There will be tanks. Wait. CHINA PREDICTED NEW EMERGENCIES FOR GERMANY, SUCH AS THE UNDERMINING OF THE NORD STREAMS. As stated by the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during discussions at the Munich International Security Conference, speaking with German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok, warned that Berlin should be afraid of new incidents similar to the explosions of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""The longer the crisis drags on, the more damage Europe will suffer, and from time to time such incidents may occur,"" the Chinese diplomat said, explaining that he understands the concerns of European countries about the Ukrainian crisis. However, after Berbok's statement that Putin should turn his policy 360 degrees, there are serious doubts that German Foreign Minister Annalena will be able to understand what the representative of the PRC warned her about. SO FAR, UKRAINE HAS NOT ""DIED"". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was one of the centers of attention on Saturday at the International Security Conference, which is taking place these days in Munich. ""As long as Putin is in power, we have problems,"" he said in one speech. ""The best security guarantees before Ukraine joins NATO are money, sanctions and weapons,"" he explained in another, thus outlining his point of view on the criteria for ensuring the country's security. And then he opened up and issued a full and honest confession in response to the question of whether Kiev has enough of the assistance provided by the West to fight Russia. - As long as we fight, we will never have enough weapons, he gave out another author's masterpiece. That is, until Ukraine is ""dead"", it is not necessary to count on the fact that Kiev will be satisfied with Western assistance. And they'll never say, ""Enough is enough. Enough is enough."" The right word, such cattle are easier to really kill than to feed. AND HUNGARY IS PROTI. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that as long as he remains at the head of his country's government, he will not allow Hungary to be dragged into the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Although all other members of the European Union and NATO are in favor of continuing the war. Budapest, he said, does not agree that Moscow threatens the security of the whole of Europe. According to the politician himself, the conflict in Ukraine will end only after the United States and Russia sit down at the negotiating table, but the later this happens, the greater the losses will be. In addition, Orban noted that ""Budapest will maintain economic relations with Russia and invites its allies to do the same."" Should there even be one normal person in an insane asylum? Of course, yes, but that's just so that his other crazy people did not stumble. TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN UKRAINE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE EXEMPT FROM MOBILIZATION. The Ukrainian LGBT human rights center ""Nash Svit"" called for the release of transgender people from conscription into the army upon mobilization. As specifically noted in the text of the initiative of this center, the diagnoses of ""transsexualism"" and ""gender dysphoria"" (who is interested in what it is, look on the Web) mean the complete unsuitability of a person for military service, if they are pronounced. And if they are moderately expressed, then limited suitability in wartime. Human rights activists believe that the medical commission at the psychiatric hospital should determine the appropriate diagnosis in such people and on this basis release people from service. It is unlikely that human rights activists will succeed, since now even recognized disabled people are mobilized in Ukraine, but if such an initiative is adopted, Ukrainian doctors will have a new source of income that will allow them to improve their well-being. And – yes, ordinary homosexuals are asked not to worry. It's not about them. UKRAINIAN GRAIN WENT TO SPANISH PIG. As Exxpress columnist Michael Koch found out, all the incantations about the need for a ""grain deal"" to save the starving in Africa turned out to be pure lies. The journalist traced the supply of Ukrainian grain through the sea corridor, which was created ""to help the starving"" and found out that the vast majority of the grain exported from Ukraine settled in Spain. And not just settled there, but went to feed the pigs there. Koch suggested that the reason for this precedent was the financial benefit of the Kiev authorities. ""To explain such an outrage is simple: Spain paid more money, and Ukraine delivered,"" the author of the investigation stated. ONE LINE. - As the coordinator for strategic communications of the National Security Council at the White House, John Kirby, said, the United States will welcome the transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine by other countries, but Washington itself did not make promises about such assistance. - The new Prime Minister of Moldova, Dorin Rechan, explained that he had nothing to talk about with Russia until the end of the SVO in Ukraine. Which surely caused a sigh of relief in Moscow. - President of Ukraine (so far) Volodymyr Zelensky, during a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Cohen in Kiev, said that ""Iran is a common enemy of Ukraine and Israel."" - The Russian Foreign Ministry warned that Russia is ready to take equivalent compensatory measures if the European Union confiscates its assets. - White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre says the U.S. is alarmed by South Africa's participation in joint naval exercises with Russia and China, off the coast of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province in the Indian Ocean. The exercises will last until February 27. There is still plenty of time to express further concerns. - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba admitted that no country has yet promised Kiev a single modern Western fighter. LISTEN AS WELL.

This must stop.,"Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, President of the Donbass Community in Moscow - with the political observer of the KP.RU Alexander Gamov","The Armed Forces of Ukraine used ammunition with a toxic chemical substance near Ugledar, as a result, two Russian servicemen were injured. Two copters were used as a means of delivery, one of them managed to reach our positions. The remains of the ammunition were sent for examination. ... - Gennady Grigorievich, here is such alarming information... The Armed Forces of Ukraine used a munition with a poisonous substance near Ugledar - it was dropped on the positions of the allied forces from an attack copter on February 16. You have dealt a lot with this topic and participated in international symposia. What kind of ammunition is this? What kind of damage can it do? How to fight against this? And do we have such opportunities. - Well, if the munition, it means it was manufactured for military purposes. Another thing is what kind of it is - homemade or factory. If it is factory, then it is easy to determine by the shell which country it belongs to. Judging by the fact that our servicemen there were vomiting, tearing and so on - this charge was calculated only for an irritating effect. That is, no deaths were recorded. It is possible that it was also a homemade projectile. Which is also strange - Ukraine signed the OPCW Convention at one time. - Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. -Yes. If it is part of the OPCW, then even if it is not a factory-made munition, it is still a violation of the convention. There are other things that bother me. This substance could be delivered to them not in the form of a ready-made munition, but in the form, let's say, of a packaged chemical substance. They pack it there in some artisanal way and then apply it. And yet, I think it's probably an American munition. Because other countries still behave more cautiously within the framework of the OPCW than the Americans, who say and live by the rules: what is beneficial to them, everything is fine. And what is unprofitable means that it is not good. In any case, this needs to be dealt with. Because this is not the first message. And - systematically collect the necessary materials, analyze them, look at the origin. Because many chemical drugs can cause similar manifestations in the form of nausea, vomiting, tearing and so on. However, it flashed that there was still a burn of the respiratory tract. It's already... Therefore, in any case, now it is necessary to understand and very systematically, within the framework of the convention, to present these claims. Because we'll talk, we'll discuss, and we'll forget. And here we are again. It's not even the first time we've discussed this. - Tell me, that's how protected our warriors are in positions. - They are not yet protected (in the sense of having anti-incidents). Because their ammunition does not include even an elementary gas mask. Because everyone proceeds from the fact that chemical weapons are prohibited for use. And even, I will give you such a historical analogy, Hitler, when he attacked our country, had chemical weapons, but he did not use them. He used it in the gas chambers, but so that on the battlefield - such facts for the entire Great Patriotic War were not recorded. -I got it. So, it's time to include gas masks in the ammunition. - First, collect all the data, conduct all the necessary analyzes. Examine people who have been subjected to this. And on the basis of this, we have chemical and biological protection troops headed by General Kirillov. And through this system, this is their entire task, to present and declare, including through the Chemical Weapons Convention, that ammunition that has been banned for use since the First World War is used here.

What is the West so afraid of? What goals did Russia pursue when launching a military special operation to protect the Donbass. About this political observer of the KP.RU Alexander Gamov talked with a well-known politician, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, President of the Russkiy Mir Foundation Vyacheslav Nikonov. - Vyacheslav Alekseevich, what, in your opinion, were the main reasons for Russia's recognition of the Donbass republics and the decision to conduct a special operation. - This is a whole complex of reasons, the main of which, of course, is the humanitarian catastrophe that broke out in the Donbas after the Kiev regime launched an eight-year war, destroying thousands of residents of Donetsk, Lugansk, Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics who opposed the anti-constitutional coup in Kiev. People really died, Russian people who wanted to speak their native language – in Russian, who wholeheartedly sought to be in alliance with our country, who advocated good-neighborly relations with Russia. - External forces - the policies of the European Union, the United States - somehow influenced the development of the situation in the direction of the conflict. - Of course, the geopolitical situation also played a huge role. The United States was turning Ukraine into a NATO military bridgehead, preparing to deploy its fleet in Odessa, in Ochakov, in Mariupol, preparing to install its missiles on our borders. Naturally, we could not allow this to happen. Russia took all the necessary diplomatic steps, proposed solutions to the conflict related to the implementation by NATO of the agreements signed by NATO on the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which did not imply the presence of NATO armed forces in the new states. Russia asked for guarantees of non-expansion of NATO to the countries of Eastern Europe. But the Western ""partners"" abandoned their own promises to Soviet leader Gorbachev in exchange for dissolving the Warsaw Pact. - Opponents of the SVO believe that it would be better to keep the situation with the DPR and LPR in a frozen state, in a state of ""no peace, no war"". - By the end of 2021, the Russian Federation had intelligence data, later confirmed, that the Ukrainian armed forces, their NATO patrons were preparing genocide in the Donbas, an offensive against the republics in March 2022. Therefore, the operation was carried out as a preventive one. - Our cause is just. - Of course, our cause is right. The victory will be ours. - The enemy will be defeated. -Certainly.

The organizer of the teleconference ""Cossacks-heroes: a point of support and thoughts about the Motherland"" in the framework of the media project ""Cossacks-defenders of the Fatherland"" was the All-Russian Cossack Society. Participants are fighters and atamans of all military Cossack societies and two districts. Among them were the Cossack heroes of ""Z"". The fighters were cautious in their answers about the SVO, but instantly perked up, remembering sincere letters, talismans and amulets in the form of hearts and prayer books that schoolchildren sent them. ""Cossacks wear such letters at their hearts, they believe that a child's pen creates a conspiracy from a bullet and a fragment,"" experienced people assure. After the teleconference, ataman of the All-Russian Cossack Society (VSKO) Nikolai Doluda spoke with journalists. He shared the latest figures. It turns out that as many as 13 Cossack volunteer detachments have been formed in Russia, taking part in the SVO. ""This, taking into account the rotation, is 16200 fighters who are ready and able to fight. By mid-March, there will be 2 more detachments with trained volunteers, ""said Nikolai Alexandrovich. No one doubts the quality of the training of the Cossack volunteers. Deputy Governor of the Krasnodar Territory, Ataman of the Kuban Cossack Army Alexander Vlasov, during a teleconference drew attention to the fact that at the end of September last year, the Kuban Cossack Army created the first Cossack training center in Russia ""Kuban"", where, under the supervision of instructors, the process of training Cossack volunteers is underway. In December, branches of the Kuban center appeared in the Samara Region and the Republic of Adygea. And this year another such branch is planned to be opened in the Moscow region. By the way, busts and museum corners of the dead Cossack volunteers will appear in 150 Cossack schools and 29 Cossack cadet corps. Thus, the fallen heroes of Operation Z will continue to fight for the minds and hearts of children in schools. Children will know their fellow countrymen of the heroes of the SVO in person. According to Nikolai Doluda, each family where a man died is assigned a group of Cossacks who provide comprehensive assistance to the mothers, wives and children of the victims. And the Cossacks in the SVO zone are equipped with everything necessary. ""513 million rubles were collected, for which 343 drones, communication equipment, thermal imagers, 113 cars and equipment for organizing hostilities were purchased,"" Doluda began to list. Ataman of the Kuban army Alexander Vlasov also told how a volunteer can get to the retraining center: a Cossack needs to contact the ataman of the primary (khutor, stanichny or urban) Cossack society in which he is a member in order to get on the lists of those wishing to undergo training. ""When recruitment begins, volunteers are brought to the retraining training center, where they are given uniforms and the necessary equipment to perform combat missions,"" Vlasov explained. After the teleconference, the Komsomolka special correspondent managed to talk to one of the oldest Cossacks, who is now operating on the frontline of the SVO. Behind the shoulders of this Cossack volunteer, ataman of the Holy Cross District Cossack Society of the Stavropol District Cossack Society of the Terek Cossack Military Society (SRKO SOKO TVKO) Vladimir Popov, the war in Afghanistan, the fight against terror in the Chechen Republic, the events in Budyonnovsk, Armenia. Suffice it to say that in Afghanistan he served in the operational-reconnaissance combat detachment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR ""Cobalt"". Today, Vladimir Vladimirovich continues to lead groups of plastuns to the rear of Ukrainian nationalists. And at 68, he's always one step ahead of the young fighters. If you have to drag the wounded. - Such a rule: together they went on reconnaissance, together they returned. We do not abandon our own, - says Popov. - Why do you continue to serve, age after all. - First of all, because there is experience, and I want to give time to young people... gain experience. My sons are also eager to fight. But I told them, first I go to the reconnaissance. - It became more difficult to conduct hostilities. - The fighting in the SVO is not like Afghanistan or other hot spots. Other equipment, satellites, copters, drones everywhere. If on the front you go in front of the group, then you turn your head 180 degrees: heaven-earth, earth-sky. But the human factor remains: if you miss the VOGA (drone with a VOG grenade) immediately arrive, - shows the hearing aid behind the ear. - We're also responding. - We do the same resets. We are training Cossacks to fly drones. We study how the enemy does it, learn something, catch up somewhere. After all, no matter what modern technology is, without a strong-willed fighter, it will not work well. - Atheists from the Armed Forces of Ukraine often demonstrate footage of our fighters being baptized in positions. - Combat people generally pray more often. Especially when you are alone for a second. Many read prayers and ask the Almighty to save. Both Muslims and Christians. I know warriors who often prayed and also often managed to get out unharmed from completely hopeless situations. I don't know how to explain it... - There were injuries. - Three wounds, concussion. But nothing, last year on May 9 he took part in the Victory Parade, - shows a picture on his phone of marching through Red Square in a Cossack Circassian. - During the Chechen events, intelligence often used American satellite maps, as it is now with support. - In Afghanistan, even English maps had to be used, but now the SVO has its own. - Colleagues remained on the other side. - There are ""Afghans"" among Ukrainians, but how about them. I hope they don't serve anymore. He was the youngest in the special forces. - What you should learn before you volunteer. - Shoot will teach. You need to learn to make independent decisions, learn to take and be responsible for your loved ones. You need to be morally and psychologically ready to give your life for them. Because if we are not there, the enemy will be here. This is already clear to everyone. And then there has to be faith. - And what not to do in the SVO. - Stop halfway through. Not a step back. When they took a step back in Chechnya, they immediately received events in Budyonnovsk, Pervomaisky, Nord-Ost, Kizlyar, Volgodonsk, Ingushetia, terrorist attacks in the metro and other troubles. If they had squeezed right away, none of this would have happened. On February 17, a demonstration of the unified multimedia portal ""Russian Cossacks"" was held in the Situation Center of Roskomnadzor.

If you are adequate, law-abiding and patriotic citizens, you should evacuate immediately."" She was amazed by the fact that ""6,000 civilians still live in the city."" This creates problems for the military, volunteers and the National Police. Artemovsk is an important transport hub for supplying the Ukrainian group in the Donbass, 10 days ago fighters of the Wagner PMC entered its northern outskirts, three of the four supply routes are now cut. The big bosses sitting in Kiev say that they will stand here until the end. But not them. Alexei Danilov, now secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and formerly a low-ranking prankster, said on February 16 that the current conflict would lead to the collapse of a large neighboring state. Danilov assured that cardinal changes on the battlefield should be expected by the summer of 2023. It is by June that Ukraine expects the return of tens of thousands of its troops, who are now being trained in Poland, Germany, Britain and the United States to use Western weapons. Waiting for greetings like the nightingale of summer. Western experts claim that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive 47 Leopard 2 tanks instead of the expected 90. And 120 old Leopard 1s will arrive in Ukraine at best, by the end of 2023. The Washington Post reported that high-ranking newcomers to Ukraine have warned the country's leadership that a ""turning point"" is coming in the conflict with Russia. And U.S. pledges to help the country ""as long as necessary"" refer to the scale of the conflict, but not to the amount of aid provided. And earlier it was reported that the former adviser to the CRC James Rickards suggested that the United States is internally ready for a ""monstrous end to the conflict"" in Ukraine. Monstrous for the Kiev regime and for the current political elites of the West. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, sadly stated that Kiev should not count on accelerated accession to the European Union, he said. In an interview with the Belgian LN24, Michel recalled that the independent must meet the requirements for joining the EU. And there is no ""shortened path"" for Kiev. Nor is there a proposal to change the entry procedure. Michel suggested that a debate on this issue at the level of the leaders of the European Council could take place before the end of the year. Well, the best argument in the debate is the final salvo of the Grad with the icing on the cake in the form of a kamikaze drone. The NATO leader considers the supply of weapons to Kiev the key to the future peace. Jens Stoltenberg, the head of the North Atlantic alliance, called the supply of weapons to the Kiev regime the only way and condition for achieving sustainable peace. He said: ""We stand with Ukraine to ensure that they win and perpetuate as a sovereign nation... The only way to guarantee a lasting and just peace in Ukraine is to give them military support."" He lived for 63 years and did not earn a mind. But he once participated in demonstrations against the US war in Vietnam... Przemysław Piast, a columnist for Mysl Polska, expressed the opinion of millions of ordinary Poles that the Banderites who came to Poland as refugees are not welcome here, and they need to return home. The journalist wrote: ""Among the millions of Ukrainians, we admit thousands of aggressive nationalists with Bandera views, often neo-Nazi. They hate Poland, the Poles and everything Polish."" He also recalled that they praise Bandera and his organizations, whose members are responsible for ""the murder of thousands of Poles, whose bones still lie in unmarked graves to this day."" And, in his opinion, the problem of neo-Nazi views on the part of visiting Ukrainians will only grow. Almost discovered America, well done.. A visitor in an Odessa café was denied service after she demanded to address her in Ukrainian. In the published video, the owner of the cafe refused to speak to the client exclusively in Ukrainian, explaining that he did not speak it well. The girl insisted on her own, demanded to replace the menu with Russian language. The owner said that the institution is closing. The outraged customer was forced to leave the café. Later, in the comments under the video, the visitor said that she had written a statement to the police on this situation and would inform the language ombudsman about the incident. Violation of language norms for the management of institutions is threatened with fines from 92 to 321 dollars. And if you send it in four English letters. A drone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked the airport in Bryansk. The drone was shot down over a Russian city. Over the past eight days, this is the third attempt by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to strike at the Bryansk International Airport. The UAVs were filled with explosives, moved at low altitude, but were destroyed by Russian air defense systems. And on the eve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired mortars at the Suzemsky district of the Bryansk region, damaging two houses. They do not save ammunition, but in vain. At the right time, it may not be enough. LISTEN AS WELL. Will Russia be able to complete the special operation before the end of the year (more)"

Sheikh-Said Mutalibov, instantly assessing the situation, dispersed the personnel, using the conditions of the terrain, and entered into battle with the enemy. Taken by surprise, the militants, having suffered losses, hurriedly left their positions. After the battle, Sheikh-Said Mutalibov, having put up a guard, together with his subordinates, began to analyze the rubble that prevented the movement of the column.

Sergeant Taras Tsitsiurk. ""The unit of Russian servicemen, which included Sergeant Taras Tsytsiurka, carried out a combat mission to oust Ukrainian nationalists from the settlement. Moving through the village, Taras personally discovered an ambush of nationalists. Moving stealthily, getting as close as possible, Taras destroyed the militants' hiding place, in which there were six nationalists, with a well-aimed throw of a grenade. As it moved deeper into the village, the unit came under mortar fire from the enemy. It was decided to take refuge in a nearby abandoned building to wait out the shelling. As a result of another enemy salvo, the structure of the building could not withstand and collapsed. Risking his own life, under incessant mortar fire, Taras began to dismantle the rubble. He helped seven of his comrades get out. Thanks to the selfless and professional actions of Sergeant Taras Tsitsiurk, it was possible to prevent losses among the personnel, which made it possible to successfully complete the combat mission to liberate the village.

During the day, a company of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three armored vehicles, four pickups, MLRS ""Grad"", two howitzers D-20 and self-propelled guns ""Gvozdika"" were leveled. The western grouping of troops in the Kupyansk direction hit the enemy in Novoselovsky in the LPR, in Dvurechna, Krakhmalnaya and Olshan of the Kharkiv region. Two platoons of ""warriors of light"", two armored vehicles, five cars and MLRS ""Grad"" went to heaven. The southern grouping of troops in the Donetsk direction has identified up to 135 fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the ""two hundredth"". In the area of Verkhnekamenskoye in the DPR, a warehouse with ammunition of the 54th Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was destroyed. The group of troops ""East"" in the South-Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions continued its hard work in the areas of Ugledar and Prechistovka in the DPR. Enemy losses were about two platoons killed and wounded. In the Kherson direction, four ammunition depots of the 123rd and 126th territorial defense brigades were hit. Burn, burn clearly. Eli Cohen, Israel's foreign minister, met with Zelensky and his counterpart Kuleba in the capital on February 16. Cohen intends to reopen the Israeli embassy in Kiev and visit Bucha and Babi Yar (is he putting them on the same board?!). Earlier, Israeli Ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Brodsky said that his country could mediate in the negotiations between Kiev and Moscow if the parties wished. Well, as long as the head of the independent, a Jew by nationality, will pursue a Nazi policy towards the population of Donbass, talking to him about anything at the negotiating table is like persuading a guinea pig to swim across the sea. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the head of Sevastopol, reported an attack by Ukrainian drones on the city of Russian military glory. According to him, two drones were shot down over the sea, air defense forces repelled the attack. Earlier it became known that the high level of terrorist threat in Sevastopol was extended indefinitely. Such a serious regime was introduced in Sevastopol after an unsuccessful attempt to attack the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in the city center with a drone. In general, the attacks on this city ended badly for all the aggressors. Andrei Turchak, deputy speaker of the Federation Council and head of the coordinating parliamentary group on CVO issues, said that the group had completed the preparation of a report to the President of Russia. The report is based on the analysis of more than 20 thousand appeals from the participants of the special operation and their relatives. As well as materials of the group's trips to new regions. Earlier, Turchak said that the working group on CBO issues no longer receives such a number of appeals regarding salaries, as it was in September-October, at the beginning of mobilization. Lapping time has passed. General Mark Milley, head of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Pentagon, having analyzed the arsenal of weapons, believes that it will have to increase military spending against the background of Ukraine's growing need for ammunition. According to Milley, Kiev consumes so much ammunition that the US Defense Department has to revise its own plans to make sure that ""everything is done correctly, and then it needs to be included in the budget, because ammunition is expensive."" Well, isn't that what your military wanted, Mr. Millie. Andriy Marochko, a retired lieutenant colonel in the LPR, believes that the Shortage of spare parts and consumables for weapons and equipment of foreign production is growing in the Ukrainian army. Spare parts and tools supplied by the West for maintenance and repair of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not enough in all areas. Replenishment is too slow due to disruption of logistics. And the Ukrainian military themselves cannot effectively repair all this Western equipment, since it fails even with minor frosts or with serious pollution. Little did they know that real tanks are not afraid of dirt. Paul Massaro, a senior political adviser to the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, deleted a post on social media where he posted a photo of the patch with Bandera. And he said that he was deleting the photo at the request of a ""good Polish friend"": ""May God bless the Polish-Ukrainian friendship and let it remain strong forever."" Earlier, this prominent figure published a picture where he is dressed in a green jacket with a patch, which depicts Bandera, with whose blessing in the 1930s and 40s Ukrainian nationalists massacred Poles. Such friendship, of course, cannot but be eternal. According to a source in the Independent Air Force, which leads the publication ""Strana"", the independent in 2022 began to use balloons with reflectors to disorient the air defense of Russia. Ukraine launched balloons over Russian territory – after which Russia allegedly began to do the same. The source explained that this is an ordinary helium balloon wrapped in foil, which flies at the speed of the wind and the main task of which is to disorient the air defense. Earlier, a representative of the Ukrainian Air Force said that Russian balloons with radar angular reflectors were flanking over the Kiev region. That is, Americans are confident in alien intervention, and you do not listen to your older brother. The Economic Court of Kiev issued a ""miraculous"" decision: to demolish the chapel of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). It stands in the center of the capital. Almost on the place where the Tithe Church was located - the first stone temple in Russia. According to oleksandr Tkachenko, Minister of Culture and Information Policy, the court ordered to release the site of the National Museum of History of Ukraine from the ""illegally built chapel, because it is located in the buffer zone of UNESCO monuments, where new construction is prohibited, and violates the ensemble of the historical archaeological complex ""Tithe Church"". Yes, it is not the chapel that violates the ensemble, but your darkness and stupidity spoil both the view and the air. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4723791/,Dmitry STESHIN,2023-02-20,"""The heart of the hero beats forever"": how our fallen fighters give signs from heaven to save the living","Voenkor Dmitry Steshin told how a sign from a deceased friend, fighter Arnie, saved him from death","I wrote to Arnie at 4:11 p.m., ""Hi, I don't mind if I come to Ugledar tomorrow to sit in the same trench with you? I'll bring the book as promised, let's chat. In the last post in his telegram channel ""Firefighter"", Arnie wrote that ours were hooked on the Ugledar dachas and everything somehow calmed down, there is no fever of assault and I reasoned that I would not particularly interfere with anyone. At 6 p.m., I received a call from our mutual friend: ""Arnie died, blown up on a mine."" Andrei Rakhiv, a volunteer, art corrector and former firefighter, left us. And Arnie was a poet, a master of hand-to-hand combat and one of the foundations of the St. Petersburg fan movement. The other day, in his memory, Serbian colleagues unfurled a huge banner in the stands: ""The heart of the hero beats forever."" I met him in early May, at the location of the Vostok battalion near Mariupol. He came to our room with a personally forged axe of the ancient Russian model and a banner with the face of Christ. We moved the old furniture, cleared a place for his sleeping bag, somehow immediately became friends and began to live in a strict and non-drinking male team. One of the paradoxes of what is happening is that I did not often communicate with Arnie, but I went through a lot with him, enough to get to know each other in a way that you do not recognize in ten years of peaceful life. And one joint experience of ours left a strange, mystical imprint on digital photography, preserved in the material. In the gray zone, at the Azovstal marshalling yard, Arni and I, at our own risk, searched for our downed copter, moving in the footsteps of the escaped ""Azov"" *. They carried the wounded and came under mortar fire, eventually abandoning their brother-in-law. He remained there lying on a fashionable, foreign stretcher in the form of a trough. ""Azov""* fled in a terrible panic, everything poured out of their pockets and unloading. Arnie picked it up in the grass and handed me a cool pocket game console. She immediately turned on and her menu was on the ""sovereign move"". I immediately gave away a found shop with tracers: a rare thing at the time. At some point I took a picture, for some reason it always fascinated me and only now I understood its prescient meaning. Arnie seems to go down an endless and dark corridor of railway cars directly to the sky, and it is amazing blue, with such blissful clouds as in icons. When Arnie died, I found a shoot and stared at the photo for a long time. I was cold. As always, after the death of his comrade, he was once again consoled by the words of Vysotsky: ""our dead will not leave us in trouble, our fallen, like sentries."" I always believed that they were watching us from heaven. And the news from Arnie came very quickly. In the morning I went to visit an amazing man. Nikolai Vasilyevich is a former miner, who has long been retired. For the past nine years, he has been living 300 meters from the contact line, in his dilapidated house and keeping a good hundred pigeons. And pigeon breeders, people are not easy – they are intermediaries between earth and sky. Especially in such circumstances. It takes me exactly 20 minutes to go to Nikolai Vasilyevich. As they say in Donbass, something made me cowardly – I could not decide: immediately stop by the main temple of Donetsk, the Holy Transfiguration Cathedral, to put Arni a candle for repose or do it on the way back, when I will not rush? I finally stopped at the temple and there my phone rang. I also thought: ""well, who is this, how wrong it is!"". Nikolai Vasilyevich called. - Dima, don't even bother to come! We have a fight going on here, right next to the house a shell fell. Come on tomorrow if it's quieter. According to the time, it turned out: if it were not for Arni, I would have rolled up to the remains of the Donetsk airport clearly by the beginning of the shelling, maybe this shell would have found me. I reached Nikolai Vasilyevich only three days later, when a ""storm warning"", a blizzard and fog were announced throughout the Donbass. The artillery fell silent, the fighting was put on pause. Without any adventures, I rolled into the street where Nikolai Vasilyevich lives. Ahead, through the fog, the contours of the battle-swallowed airport terminal could be seen. I thought, ""Can I throw a mask on the car?"" But, a snowstorm before my eyes turned it into a snowdrift, and I decided that it was superfluous, then you could not pull it away, you would not fold it. I came out to meet the dog Asya, small, but strict and vocal. - The first dog with a human name, - joked Nikolai Vasilyevich, - before that there were ""Cliffs"", ""Shilki"", ""Nona""... Then there's the fugas cat... Let's go to the house, drink tea. My interlocutor cannot say exactly how many times he flew into his house. Shows only particularly memorable wounds. - Look, I had a TV here, a new, good one. The shelling has begun, let me move it to the floor! Exactly– do you see a hole in the wall? A hefty splinter pulled out! Then it covered me well, my teeth were knocked out. But I inserted new ones, they helped (laughs). - Where do they shoot from and what, mines. - No, shells, there are almost no craters left. I know how the mines arrive. He points his hand somewhere in the direction of the airport. - There's Tonnkoye, Vodyanoye, Lastochkino, Orlovka - the boys haven't taken it yet, Spartacus is nearby, Sands... Right across the runway and throwing. That's when you were supposed to arrive - on the way it arrived, then three houses later - the dog was killed, yesterday, at the turn to me everything is in the ground and the funnel, more neighbors got into the garden ... Nikolai Vasilyevich at some point realizes that all these lists of arrivals do not make sense and waves his hand. This middle-aged man, with the tenacity of a doomed or with the tenacity of an old miner, continues to repair his house. And this house is now warm and cozy. We drink tea, we talk and I notice – we are still on guard, listening to what is happening around. And outside the window, in a gray blizzard, the machine gun suddenly lazily says: ""so-so-so-so"" and I do not really like it, it was not enough that the Dill reconnaissance jumped out at us, the best weather for this. I ask, ""Far from us?"" Nikolai Vasilyevich, without hesitation, speaks. - Two thousand meters. I listen to the interlocutor and understand that the point at which we are, in a way, a historical place where the brightest historical figures of recent years have visited. Nikolai Vasilyevich points outside the window. - See, stack of timber? Givi brought. Oh, the commander was tough. I asked for a beam, in the morning I wake up - the guys are already unloading. Motorola says to me, ""Grandfather, I found you iron on the roof."" Exactly, a whole stack. I drove a wheelbarrow and closed the roof, not for long, really. I knew all the guys from Pyatnashka – I fed them strawberries, tomatoes, and they helped me in any way they could. Many have remarried with us. Here, very close by, the late Zakharchenko came with the wives of the prisoners. And immediately the shelling began, then the water tower was folded beautifully. Zakharchenko to the women: ""Do you see how you are shelling us?"" - And there were suckers here. - I went to the next house, in a black uniform. National Guardsman. With a machine gun, he shot off the lock and hid. I went to see him. He says to me: ""They put me in charge of the airport, but I don't want to. Now I will change into a civilian and leave."" I said to him, ""Go, surrender, fool! No one will offend you!"" -And he. - He says, like, I'll quietly sneak home through Russia myself. Well, I lived for a couple of days, changed my clothes, walked to the station (about a couple of kilometers – correspondent's note), and there is a patrol. He ran and was shot in the back. I'm trying to make sense of this story. - I didn't want to fight a prisoner of war, I thought there was nothing to take him for. But this does not happen if the uniform is put on and the weapon is taken. Nikolai Vasilyevich says that the same deserter was hiding in his attic. Brings and shows me a silver bracelet with a plate. On it are embossed some Latin letters and numbers ""93"" - a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They were also called ""cyborgs"". I ask, of course: ""is the relative fighting""? Nikolai Vasilyevich sighs. - My nephew has been lying near Avdiivka for a month, they can't stand it. Part of the family of Nikolai Vasilyevich from Vinnitsa. Haven't communicated since they were 14. When the first ""Immortal Regiment"" was being prepared in Donetsk, they flatly refused to send a photo of his grandfather who fought. But not everyone there is like this, there were those who sent a photo. We go feed the pigeons. Nikolai Vasilyevich explains his passion simply. - I've been breeding them since I was six years old. The symbol of peace is a dove or not – I don't know, but I don't eat them. Why do I need pigeons? And you scare, he will soar into the sky, you look at him and the warmth on your soul. At 14-15 in the basement pigeons hid, beaten a lot of them. And now the other scourge is predators, I have 80 pigeons. The dove in the sky stands, and the falcon grabs it, and that's it. Nikolai Vasilyevich opens an aviary with pets, pigeons of the breed ""vertuns"". But they do not fly far - they immediately sit on the ridge of the roof. ""The weather is not flying,"" the pigeon breeder chuckles. Ask. - How it all ends. Nikolai Vasilyevich, without hesitation, answers. - Our victory. - Let's reconcile. -No. They despise us and therefore kill us. There are normal people there, but there are more jackals. I don't know how we're going to put up with it. We will win, we will understand. They don't let me go just like that. Nikolai Vasilyevich made me cans of strawberry syrup, strawberry jelly and just jam, strawberry, of course. He, it turns out, has a large vegetable garden. A person cannot live without working. I was coming back to town. I slowed down a little at the so-called ""nine"", a tormented nine-story building, the so-called ""small family"" for airport employees. In 14-15 years there was a command post of ""Sparta"", ""Somalia"" and all who stormed the airport. I've been to it many times and I know how all the doors open at once when a Grad arrives at this house. The hero of my interview lived and lives very close and everyone knew him - the last resident of this village near the airport. And most likely, Nikolai Vasilyevich, in the context of terrible and bloody events, simply showed and shows with his life what these guys are fighting for – for a man who did not escape, but remained on his land, works on it and is not afraid of anything.

Lynn Tracy, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The demarche was made due to the increased involvement of the United States in hostilities on the side of the Kiev regime. A note of protest was handed to the American diplomat. Moscow expressed its position: ""Pumping the Armed Forces of Ukraine with weapons, as well as the transfer of target designations for strikes against Russian military and civilian infrastructure facilities, clearly prove the inconsistency and falsity of the Statements of the American side that the United States is not a party to the conflict."" You can make a kniksen and shuffle with your foot. Noctis Draven, a member of the US Army, shared in social networks his impressions of the message of Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Federal Assembly. Draven wrote: ""I have just finished studying Putin's speech. I once said that I would like to shake hands with the President of Russia. I want to retract that statement. Now I want to hug President Putin like a brother."" Draven noted that if there was an opportunity to choose another country where he could be born, besides the United States, he would choose Russia. Good choice.

Somewhere in the vastness of the independent. And with this comment: ""The aviation of military intelligence of Ukraine continues to work on the front line of defense of our country."" This American helicopter is used to transfer troops and cargo to the combat zone, as well as to evacuate the wounded. The other day, because of the crash of the Black Hawk in the US state of Alabama, six people were killed. Official deliveries of these machines to Kiev were not carried out. Well, who cares. They're at the forefront of the defense... The independent court banned the activities of the Party of Regions. And he decided to nationalize her assets. This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. The explanation is simple: ""According to the materials of the Security Service and the State Bureau of Investigation, the Eighth Administrative Court of Appeal satisfied the claim of the Ministry of Justice to ban the activities of the Party of Regions and transfer the property of this party to state ownership."" Another big victory in the ""fight against evil"" - there are no other victories. Serhiy Shkarlet, The Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine, said that his department has issued recommendations on the transfer of schoolchildren to a remote learning format from February 22 to 24. The Minister appealed to the heads of regional and Kiev military administrations and to the heads of schools and other educational institutions. They were invited to transfer the learning process to the online format from February 22 to 24, 2023. Earlier, schools in Rivne and Ivano-Frankivsk in the north-west of Ukraine were transferred to distance learning due to frequent air alarms these days. That is, no one in Ukraine believes in their air defenses, which are diligently trying to shoot down missiles over residential complexes, schools and kindergartens, dropping debris on them. The head of the Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, said that Ukrainian servicemen are conducting a forced evacuation of the small population of Kherson, which still remains in this Russian city founded by Potemkin at the end of the 18th century. Saldo said: ""In Kherson, the Ukrainian military is conducting a forced evacuation. It is carried out, first of all, against doctors. They are trying to expel them to Western Ukraine.

How Transbaikalians perceive the goals and objectives of the SVO. - We must protect each of our compatriots, wherever he may be. Our historical duty is to preserve our people, to preserve the traditions, accumulated spiritual values, cultural treasures of our people, carried over more than a thousand years of history of the Russian state. It is our worldview to protect and preserve each of our compatriots. And when it comes to millions of people who have completely unjustly found themselves outside our country and who, contrary to all moral laws, contrary to the human rights inherent from birth to any person, contrary to international law and numerous declarations of interstate institutions, are killed, persecuted for their native language, for their culture, for the right to live their own way of life, we simply cannot,  as a country, as a people, to stay away. - You talked a lot with the guys who went to the SVO zone. And one of our brightest heroes is Alexander Mikhailovich Sapozhnikov., the former mayor of the city of Chita, who went to fight as a volunteer. Please tell me, there is some connection with him. - Now he is on the front line, ""on the front line"", as the fighters say. Occasionally, participants in the battles appear to us to solve some issues: supply or something else. So we find out the news about fellow transbaikalians. In general, they are working now. The situation is tense. - And what do they say about the mood in the troops on the front lines. - Says that the mood is very good. Everyone understands what's going on. Everyone understands that they are faced with an absolute evil – cynical, unscrupulous. All our belligerents are in a very good moral and strong-willed state, determined to achieve victory. - We talked in detail about your decision to pay bonuses to fighters for knocked out, captured German and American tanks. - What was our main motive? When the United States and NATO began to intimidate us with their armored monsters, we decided to support our soldiers and show that these Western products are not as terrible as they are painted. And they decided to encourage our guys who were especially distinguished with prizes. Western tanks are not yet at the front. True, as they say – the first one went. Recently, the Buryat-Kalmyk crew took away a Polish tank from under the nose of the enemy. Our guys: the commander of the crew is a Zabaikal. They acted boldly. The Ukronazis tried to prevent them by shelling, inflicting a fire defeat, but the guys dragged this tank under fire anyway. - Do they fall under your decision? You will pay them a bonus. - I myself, when I learned about this case, thought about it. Polish tanks do not fall under the decision: it was originally about German Leopard and American Abrams. And after this episode, I thought: maybe we need to expand the list. - From what funds will the awards be made? You have formed a special fund for this. - We didn't form any funds in particular. We'll see how much money is needed. How Russian fighters took away the Ukrainian tan. This incident is said to have ""caused a stir"" on the front lines of the Special Military Operation. Is it a joke to steal an entire tank right under the nose of the enemy. And it was. Tankers of the Southern Military District in the heat of the battle with the Ukronazis noticed the enemy's combat vehicle. Apparently, the armored car was damaged, and the crew fled from the shelling, leaving the equipment. - The tank was in the buffer zone. Neither they (the enemy) can approach, nor can we approach,"" said Bayashkhalan Chimittsyrenov, commander of the tank company. To distract the enemy's attention, artillery fire was called on the positions of the Ukronazis. And they moved to the abandoned equipment. They picked up with a cable, but then the enemy came to his senses and began to fire fiercely at the Russian fighters. They were beaten with small arms and automatic grenade launchers. ""I cling to one cable,"" Bayashalan Chimittsyrenov continues, ""I run out from the other side of the tank, shouting to the mechanic: ""Let's pull."" They took it and pulled a Polish tank to its front line. By the way, this trophy is not the first on the account of the crew of Bayashkhalan Chimittsyrenov. On the account of the guys five knocked out enemy tanks and several armored cars. Which, in principle, is not surprising, because, as the gunner-operator Hongr Erdniyev said, the crew is well-coordinated, all for each other. But this trophy is special. The car turned out to be almost purposeful, with minimal damage. We patched it up and put it on our side. Now Russian tankers are fighting on it. READ ALSO.

Gogol is a true visionary. ""... Sometimes, looking from the porch at the yard and the pond, he said how good it would be if suddenly an underground passage was built from the house or a stone bridge was built through the pond, on which there would be shops on both sides, and that merchants would sit in them and sell various small goods necessary for the peasants. At the same time, his eyes became extremely sweet and his face took on the most satisfied expression; however, all these projects ended with only one word."" It was these lines that came to mind when I had to read the next dreams of Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, which flooded during his stay in Munich at the International Security Conference. - I have been in Munich for 24 hours, I took part in discussions about the architecture of global security, European security, relations between the United States and China. But I have not heard anyone give a detailed answer – what kind of Russia we need to live in peace, and how to achieve this. We need to start talking about it,"" he said, reeling from the realization of his own greatness (or rather, in his own eyes). - For me, the end of a military conflict is when the Russian president, with any name, visits Ukraine, kneels before the monument to the victims of Russian aggression, and begins to beg for forgiveness. For me, this will be the end of the military conflict. The Russian president kneels in Ukraine begging for forgiveness... The right word, here Manilov's dreams of a bridge over a ""green"" pond with benches on it become quite realistic against the background of such urges of Kuleba. One could just laugh at it, but the Kiev neo-Nazi was supported in the eye by the President of the Czech Republic, in the past - a general, Peter Pavel. - I'd be very happy if all of this happened within a few months. But I don't live in a perfect world, I'm more of a skeptic. I understand Ukraine's desire to end this military conflict, when all the soldiers leave the last piece of Ukrainian land, and for the Russian president to come to Ukraine and ask for forgiveness on his knees, he also dreamed and warned. - But we can get into a situation where the liberation of part of the Ukrainian territory can lead to greater losses than society can suffer. There may be a point when even Ukraine will begin to think about another end to the military conflict. Moreover, according to him, even such a joyful ending for them can be complicated by not at all optimistic consequences. - Even if there is a possibility of the collapse of the Russian army, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will oust them from Ukraine, Then Russia will collapse. There will be no one to negotiate with regard to the security guarantee regime. There will be no one to work with regarding the construction of a security architecture in Europe,"" Pavel continued and warned. - With a collapsed Russia, we will have more problems that we do not even understand now. I think it would be much better to be realistic. Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. Had Peter and kuleba been realistic, they would not have carried such nonsense, but would have thought about how to keep Ukraine within the borders that exist in reality. And the same Kuleba would rather think how to save himself from the dock and the prospect of life imprisonment. However, one cannot expect anything else from Kuleba, but how could the Czech president serve as a general in NATO with such brains? Or is the virus of Ukrainianism so contagious that it devours brains in the shortest possible time, leaving nothing in your head but a smelly Russophobic slurry? And they sit next to each other like a lady just nice and pleasant in every way. And they dream in a completely Manila way. ""... He thought about the well-being of a friendly life, about how nice it would be to live with a friend on the bank of some river, then a bridge began to be built across this river, then a huge house with such a high belvedere that you can even see Moscow from there and drink tea in the open air in the evening and talk about some pleasant objects. Then that they, together with Chichikov, came to some society in good carriages, where everyone is fascinated by the pleasantness of treatment, and that it is as if the tsar, having learned of their friendship, granted them generals, and then, finally, God knows what is, which he himself could not make out.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4723716/,Oleksandr BOYKO,2023-02-20,Kiev is trying to intimidate the families of the participants of the special operation: the truth about psychological sabotage was revealed in the Ministry of Defense,The Kiev authorities are trying to compensate for the lack of success on the battlefield of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with disinformation and measures of psychological pressure on the families of SVO participants.,"Missile strikes on the centers of information and psychological operations (hereinafter referred to as the Center for Information and Psychological Operations) in Kiev and Brovary last year were carried out at night so as not to ""put its employees at risk."" But the cynical employees did not appreciate humanism: they went from the offices to ""remote"", where they only intensified information and psychological sabotage. And the more the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer losses in their hybrid war, the closer its soldiers are to despair, the more actively the TSIPsO is working to discredit the SVO. Under Poroshenko, the CIPsO recruited anyone on the Internet, and therefore among his saboteurs were many Russian hackers and intelligence officers. One of them was the hackers of the Beregini group, who today are trying to publish updates of Western manuals, which sends the CIPSO to the email addresses of its many thousands of ""sofa troops"" and warns about new provocations of Kiev. But few places say that most of the members of this virtual community have been on the hook of Western intelligence agencies since 2007. ""Do not think that everyone is paid money in the CIPSO. Someone can first get small amounts into the account. But later this leads to private accusations of receiving income for participating in DDoS attacks on government or private sites, other illegal invasions of privacy, illegal actions. The largest and most obstinate ""players"" are arrested from time to time by Western special services and hold show trials. After such pressure, the specialist begins to unquestioningly, although not always qualitatively perform tasks, ""informed sources told KP. The structure of the CIPsO is quite multifaceted, but it is united by the nature of the actions that are conducted remotely. Employees of these centers are aimed at rocking the situation, collecting information about the moods of residents of Russian cities, undermining their trust in the army and the authorities. To do this, we use a call with the substitution of numbers for Our Russian citizens by ""bank employees"", ""policemen"", ""investigators"", ""doctors"", who not only shamelessly steal the electronic wallets of pensioners, but also simultaneously declare the mining of schools, kindergartens and shopping centers. Their task is to show that our law enforcement agencies are so weak that they are unable to protect citizens from crime. Although, everything has long been clear that there are such centers today even from a number of European countries. And two such call centers were discovered and liquidated during the SVO in Berdyansk and Mariupol. Other psychologists of the CENTER organize radical and nationalist movements with websites (101 such organizations are already banned in Russia), where citizens with mental disabilities are selected in private chats. They are first instructed for money to paste warning announcements about maniacs in parks on trees, then leaflets and flags, then various illegal actions, and then, intimidating with the kompromat collected on them, they are sent to set fire to police stations and military commissariats, shoot children in schools or eliminate individual citizens. A number of similar episodes are being investigated by the Investigative Committee of Russia. The other day, the FSB of Russia announced that since August 2022, foreign special services have literally settled on popular Russian postal services. Citizens ""steal"" mail, telegram channels, create duplicates of social pages. From them, scammers are trying to find out secret information from the military or officials. ""On behalf of the journalist, they can appeal to the head of the region, with a request to report the phones of the relatives of the CVO participants, for the preparation of the material. They ask for the number of deaths for humanitarian assistance, they are interested in the addresses of compact residence of refugees, the specifics of the work of military enterprises. Such pseudo-requests come to e-mail on forms with the symbols of Russian state services and departments, and even to the personal phones of officials. The authors of appeals can be introduced by ministers, journalists, artists, directors of enterprises, and return addresses are often similar in name to the domain names of federal executive bodies, ""the FSB warns and advises to check suspicious correspondence. It is also advised to contact the author of the letter to clarify the details, and secretaries are advised to ""not respond to these letters and not to open attachments to them."" After all, emails can be not only intelligence, but accompanied by sabotage programs. Discrediting the warriors of the SVO is being conducted today in all directions. The CIPSO receives data about them from Ukrainian and Western military intelligence. And they have access to applications banned in Russia, through which relatives sometimes continue to communicate with military personnel. Then everyone wonders why shells so accurately fly into the places of deployment of our troops. As if they were not warned that the picture from the smartphone has a binding to the coordinates. The psychologists of the CIPs use contacts of relatives of the SVO participants for mocking provocations: posing as Ukrainian servicemen, they tell someone's mother or father on the phone that they will now take away some part of their son's body, extort money. Such calls cause unrest among the relatives of the unit's servicemen, which spill over into the network. They can also introduce themselves as employees of military recruitment offices who take the body of the murdered person home, lawyers, lawyers, postal workers, couriers. In parallel, on the Internet, the CIPsO creates websites with the name of Russian units, where they urge relatives to discuss incoming calls, describe non-existent conflicts between unit commanders, and in order to undermine the credibility of the commanders of these units, they write that the sons do not have enough ammunition and ammunition. Yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defense had to officially refute the report of the CIPsO about the alleged dismissal of officers of the 1st Donetsk and 2nd Lugansk Army Corps after their entry into the Russian army. In such a chat, they can also drop some order ""to shave the beards of Chechen soldiers"" or a ban on praying. Rumors can be difficult to extinguish, since our servicemen may be on the front line and communication with them is difficult. Having found out in the correspondence the phone numbers and addresses of the families of the SVO warriors, the employees of the CIPsO switch the participants themselves. They begin to call and threaten that while they are away from home, ""trouble may happen to their loved ones."" They call the names of loved ones, addresses. It is clear that after such threats, it becomes difficult for fighters to focus on service. There is growing psychological pressure on Russian citizens who take Russian citizenship in the liberated territories. And if the caches that the Ukrainian special services leave for saboteurs in the liberated territories are found quite quickly thanks to modern search equipment, then it is difficult to eliminate the pages and sites that are mined with the entire Internet. These are not iron Leopards that can be tracked during the transfer across the border and transportation to the front line. Here, thousands of accounts are ""shot"" with millions of green papers, which instantly turn into Russophobic posts, statements, investigations. In the liberated territories, intimidation of the population and new chapters is in full swing. Thus, employees of the CiPsO on behalf of the former Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov (in the city he was jokingly nicknamed ""the mayor at a distance"") daily declare the ""inevitable return of the region under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"", threaten residents with reprisals for cooperation with the Russian army. And they are also discrediting humanitarian support for the population with all their might. In recent days, fakes have been increasingly planted that the new heads of districts ""have no experience in managerial activities"", all corrupt officials, discredit their image in every possible way. Or they claim that Russian troops are allegedly preparing the evacuation of civilians from the Zaporozhye region, after which they will surrender it to Kiev. ""There can be no question of any evacuation from the Zaporizhzhya region. The administration of the region is at work. All services are operating normally. We are reliably protected from any provocations,"" the current head of the Melitopol administration, Yevgeny Balitsky, reassures citizens daily. He, like many other heads of districts, asks residents not to panic, remain calm and not to believe fake news, which continues to multiply online according to Western manuals by Bandera members of the 21st century. The cynicism of the CIPsO is a striking distinguishing feature. Especially if the target audience of the stuffing is Ukrainians. Only the CIPsO can appropriate video footage of Russian volunteers handing over dead Ukrainian servicemen in coffins and claiming that it is in the coffins of a troupe of Russian fighters. Only they can call their telegram channels like ""Crimea is the land of partisan glory."" Or dress a Ukrainian drug addict in a Russian uniform, but leave Ukrainian leggings on it, while placing a chevron on his right hand and writing a post with a text in which the Ukrainian ""i"" slips through. And also theatrically smash the head of stormtrooper Dmytro Yakushchenko with a sledgehammer, accusing him of betrayal, and then forget about it and exchange him for Ukrainian servicemen. Now the murdered Yakushchenko tells the network about how ukrainians forced him to commit this staged dramatization under the threat of death of his relatives. Now the TSIPsO is turning a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergei Makarenko, who shot Russian prisoners, some kind of superman. He declares from every iron that he will continue to kill and ""live forever."" Although, according to some reports, he, along with other killers, was transferred to the rear unit, where he records his ""immortal"" videos. According to the staff of the CIPsO, the ""immortal"" Makarenko should show that war crimes in Ukraine are not only encouraged by the command, but also go unpunished. And yesterday it became known about the delivery to Ukraine from Europe of several containers with ""radioactive materials"". The Kiev regime is going to use them for local contamination of the area in order to show the world another ""Powell test tube"" at the opening of the 11th emergency special session of the UN General Assembly. There, official Kiev plans to accuse Russia of allegedly ""gross violation"" during a special military operation of the obligations of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. On February 14, the Interdepartmental Coordination Headquarters of Russia for Humanitarian Response exposed the details of the provocation from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant being prepared by Western special services and reported on the preparation by the Kiev regime, with the support of the United States and European countries, of a large-scale information provocation (""great event"") to accuse Russia. IT'S THE HANDWRITING OF THE CIPS. - Pictures in suspicious materials can be copied and found similar through the download-search of images on the network. Often in the frame there may be the names of Ukrainian divisions, local newspapers, announcements. - If local residents or Ukrainian artists are used in photos and videos for the purpose of provocation, their faces are not fully shown, since their identity has become easy to establish with the help of Ukrainian police bases. - When stable clichés from the manuals are used as arguments: ""everything is not true"", ""everything is wrong"", ""the whole world hates you"", ""they will never forgive you"". - The author signs the pictures with messages in which the Latin ""i"" slips through. - The threat in Russian language is written in such a way that any surname can be inserted into the text. Manuals are used to write threats. - Artemovsk is persistently called Bakhmut. - They work out the following topics in the chats: ""I returned from the SVO paid the mortgage, bought a car"", ""the revival of the USSR through the SVO"", ""you are fighting for the children of oligarchs"". - They say that for refusing to comply with the order of the commander, ""you can do with an administrative article"" and return home. In fact, a criminal punishment awaits a colony. - Offer in the telegram channel to download the contract for the purchase of advertising (the file is infected with a virus). The network has now appeared a fresh example of how to talk with Ukrainian provocateurs on the phone. The Muscovite not only gave the police his number, but recorded the entire conversation on another phone. A sample of the voice will be useful to Russian investigators in court, when the fraudster is detained. Here's the conversation itself. - Valeria Yurievna, you have received a personal letter from the MFC. How do you want to receive it: in electronic format, Viber, Telegraph, WhatzUp, by post of Russia to the registration address. - And you're from where. - Moscow, Voznesensky Lane, 22. - Since when do the State Services call WhatsUp. - New redirection method. - What do you want. - Forward this email. - What a letter, with what character. - There may be statements, fines, taxes, pension fund, documentation, personal information I can not view. - You're from Dnipro or from somewhere. - From which Dnieper. - The letter may be of the nature that I bought through public services machines to in Ukraine. ""Listen, I'd like to slap you in the face,"" the scammer says. - What do you think for a long time you will deceive so much that it was not possible to deceive the khokhol, khokhol surrender khokhol, - laughs from the heart Valeria Yurievna.

A few minutes before our passage, the enemy was processing duty targets, entering along the road connecting Soledar and Krasnaya Gora, a suburb of Artemovsk (Bakhmut). As luck would have it, there were several cars in one place at once, which fell under fire. Cars slowly flared up, raising a black column of smoke into the sky. Together with the attendants, we turn around and drive through the fields. - We drove everything here on the trawl ourselves, there should be no mines, - Fillmore sets up an optimistic mood. I stopped in Soledar to visit the Wagner PMC to the accompaniment of artillery explosions and the music of whistling mines. The company's fighters were able to storm this settlement in two weeks. The operation was now developed by the Hero of Russia with the call sign ""Lotus"", in the past - a paratrooper officer. However, paratroopers are not former. - The modern way to storm cities is to cover them. But at the same time, we must not forget that the coverage should go on a broad front. That is, with the possibility of maneuver to push back the enemy's reserves, which can go to the flank or rear of the attacking grouping, ""Lotus"" explained to me at the entrance to the city. - The sooner we notice the enemy, the sooner we begin to use artillery and our own firepower - tanks, ATGMs, etc. The closer the enemy has come, the harder it is for us to stop him, because the shell has a scattering of fragments up to 800 meters. So, when the enemy comes close to us, we can no longer use artillery. So is the enemy. And when we come close, it is almost impossible to stop us. Because the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot withstand the shooting battle. There would be more ammunition. Unfortunately, with the active advance, the stormers begin to experience shell hunger, which must be quenched promptly in order not to lose offensive inertia. And there is someone to find a use for ammunition here. - When I was still serving in the army, my commanders always said: first knowledge, and then ranks. Therefore, I tried to transfer this principle of work to our company, - the chief of artillery of the ""musicians"" shared with me. - We have professional competition. If any flight commander begins to professionally reduce his level, then another person will be appointed in his place, who will perform the task faster and better. - In this conflict, we first encountered NATO artillery... - Not for the first time, we came here, already learned the lessons of other NATO artillery. I'm not going to say which one now, but we've met more than once, she taught us a lot. Life forced the development of new tactics for conducting combat operations by artillery units. But I won't tell you about it. You should clearly understand that weapons are just iron. It all depends on the people. If the personnel, what is on our part, what is on the other side, will be professionally trained, there will be a result. If people who simply do not know how to use them are put on new modern weapons, the result will be different. - And how do you assess the personnel of the enemy. - Firstly, both in Soviet times and in the post-Soviet era, the Ukrainian school of artillery has always been famous for its specialists. They are great, since 2014 they have deployed all artillery schools and are training professionals. Well, we draw conclusions, take action quickly. Soledar was a strategic node of defense of the north of the Artyomovsk agglomeration, on which the logistics chains of the enemy were tied. Having liberated it, the ""musicians"", with the support of the artillery of the Armed Forces of Russia, advanced closer to Bakhmut itself, liberating first its suburb - Krasnaya Gora, and then engaged in fighting in Paraskovievka, through which the highway to Slavyansk leaves. I am taken to Red Mountain by Fillmore, who has been fighting in the company for almost six months. The first contract soon ends and after a short vacation he is going to return to his squad, where he has already made a career from an ordinary private to a sergeant major in the rear and tray service. The position does not sound combative, but imagine that ammunition, water and provisions should be delivered to the front line, and from there to pick up the wounded. And all this with your feet under fire. Fillmore knows all the paths and paths in the area, so he was dressed up as our escort. - Who was he? I ask the hoarse boy. - ... After a short pause, he replies. The combat ""orchestra"", as you know, at one time recruited volunteers from among the convicts. And the native of Volgodonsk ""Fillmore"" is one of them. By the age of 24, there are already two ""walkers"". The first, as he says, ""for his"" - for the wallets that he ""pulled"" from the cars. The second ""for nothing"": ""I just drove my friends to the robbery, but I did not participate in it myself."" On SVO, he assures, he rethought his views on life: ""How can you not respect yourself in order to sit down again after all this?!"" I remember asking one: ""You only had a month to sit, and you were in the heat for six months with an unobvious chance of staying alive. Why?"" ""And I want to come home as a man,"" he replies. ""Not to be ashamed in front of Mom and Dad."" And next to the former inmates are reserve officers. Here is an elderly fighter with glasses and a gray beard. It seems modest. - Call sign ""Pocha"", lieutenant colonel, ex-head of the group of the operational and analytical department of the GRU of the General Staff. I resigned in 2009 when we were downsizing. Or rather, fired. When the president announced a partial mobilization, as a patriot of his homeland, he immediately called the military recruitment office: guys, I am ready. The answer is from there: as long as there is no order, there are no orders, we ourselves do not know what to do with you. I went to the military enlistment office more than once, asked for a lower position, in any case I am ready to go and defend the Motherland. They don't take it. I came to Wagner. Here I was received, here we have a brotherhood, we are all the same, equal. You can go to the commander and say what you think, and get an answer. - So you, a former GRU lieutenant colonel, are now fighting as an ordinary stormtrooper? - I ask again. - On a par with former prisoners. - Yes, and they're all my family. In a forest belt we stop the car. Then on foot. On the left, 300 meters away, shells explode: ""They are our mortars trying to get,"" the escorts explain. On the right is the artillery of the ""musicians"", working to suppress. And we walk along the path of the ""dwarf forest"", the height of which does not exceed human height. All bushes and trees are literally cut off with metal. At first, I thought it was the ""job"" of shell fragments. Until we hit two machine gun emplacements from which the enemy was watering our stormtroopers. It's scary to imagine what the density of the fire was. Along the trail here and there there are piles of bodies of Armed Forces soldiers sprinkled with snow. They are pulled out of broken dugouts and trenches and stacked to be exchanged for their dead. Cargo-200 to the other side goes in cargo columns. The ratio of losses is 1 of ours to 7 of the enemy. The Artyomovsk meat grinder continues to harvest its bloody harvest. "" Red Mountain is a strategic point, here the terrain allows us to conduct reconnaissance, artillery training,"" the deputy platoon commander meets us in the basement of one of the broken buildings. - The assault is very difficult, the enemy is well prepared for defense, machine gun nests are not even broken by a grenade launcher from the first time. But thanks to cunning, we bypassed and destroyed these positions. Although they last until the last cartridge. We're fine with intelligence. We know exactly where the enemy is, in what quantity, where is the machine gun, where is the mortar. Suppress the artillery, then move. The castle platoon is from the orphanages. Independently got up on his feet, equipped himself with a box, was engaged in the repair of cars - painter, ""bodywork"", electrician. Like everything was enough, got married, had a child. But he was tempted to make easy money through fraud with payments of insurance companies for OSAGO. And he went to the colony under the article ""fraud"". Together we move in short runs along Red Mountain, and the stormtrooper tells how he knocked the enemy out of every house. - Upstairs I had a sniper sitting there, suddenly the arrival there, the entrance crumbles, I think, well, that's it, the sniper is gone. And he didn't make it to the edge of the house — he was tying a shoelace. Then I arrived here, the roof was all fucking, I was already standing here. Three seconds earlier, and I wouldn't be standing here now. By the way, do you see all this destruction? When they cleaned up, all these buildings were still intact. As soon as the enemy was completely knocked out of here, he scattered everything with artillery. We will not go further, there is a ""rut"". -A what. - Throw artillery. We use slang and jargon for radio exchange. - And how it will be ""to go on the attack"". - ""On Style"". Fillmore and I are ""on style"" tomorrow. - And what will you do when you return home? -Ask. - I don't know, maybe I'll go to Africa with the company. If my wife allows. Nearby, heavy machine guns ""sang"". The Armed Forces of Ukraine, not thinking to surrender, tried to break through the positions captured by the ""musicians"", but stumbled upon a competent defense. Meanwhile, the assault squads continue to cover Paraskovievka in order to cut off the northern logistics route of Bakhmut. ""The highway is already blocked and is completely under our fire control,"" one of the commanders, formerly from the internal troops, told me. - The encirclement of Paraskovievka itself is coming to an end, there are already battles in it. At the same time, the enemy uses field roads in the dark, it is very difficult to detect the delivery. Behind Paraskovievka we go further, we work for the full encirclement of Artemovsk. The enemy understands that he is partially blocked, but there is no loss of control there, they seriously resist, they do not experience shell hunger. But we will definitely press them. KSTAT. Western planes will not help Kiev. I briefly managed to talk to the commander of the Wagner air group. He asked if Ukrainian pilots would quickly master NATO fighters. - We see that they are quickly adjusting their equipment to the use of the same Western-made ammunition. Yes, there will be some problems, maintenance, spare parts. It's long, tedious, and more for information noise. But, again, the same F-16, what will it do here? Our air defense is nearby, he will not be able to enter. Our air defense is much more effective than Ukraine's. So let them come. We see that the enemy had heavy losses in aviation. We all have experienced people, they probably have only young people left. In aviation, you need experience to work properly. Just pulling the handle is stupid, as there used to be an expression: ""pen - gas - pay"", here it will not work. And experience is gained only over time, and in different combat conditions. We have a lot of people going through other hot spots. Therefore, we work as best we can, we work well and efficiently. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4725406/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-02-23,"Biden unleashes ""smokescreen gases"" of kindness",And its vassals in Europe and subordinates in the United States do not hide that they intend to tear apart and destroy Russia.,"Just the other day, US President Joseph Biden spoke in the favorite style of Goebbels propaganda: ""Politruk is lying, it's good in our captivity, surrender, we are not your enemies."" The latter sounded literally verbatim. - I want to once again appeal to the people of Russia. The U.S. and European countries do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West did not plan to attack Russia... And millions of Russian citizens who just want to live in peace with their neighbors are not enemies (to us, the West),"" Said Joseph Biden. Tempting? To be honest, not really. Because we hear these incantations from time to time all these years, and the actions and deeds of Western politicians are at odds with these words. However, this was the case before. And now in the same West, they no longer hide the fact that they are not satisfied with the whole of Russia. Totally. They threw away the norms of morality and decency. They seriously believe that our fellow citizens do not have access to modern means of mass communication, and we will dutifully be content with the chewing gum that they share with us in a wide public space, and we will not know what they say in their interlocutors. Probably, for the reason that they really believe that we have the Internet here on coupons, and we celebrate holidays with a bottle of vodka and ezhatin on coupons, and only representatives of the Russian elite have toilets. And now Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas at the Munich International Security Conference declares that after ""the victory of the North Atlantic Alliance in Ukraine, the mentality of the Russians should be forcibly rewritten with the help of techniques and methodologies that have long been worked out in the Baltic States."" And then she called for an analogue of the Nuremberg Tribunal over Russia. About the trial of Estonia, which was the first in Europe to report to Berlin that it was ""completely cleansed of Jews,"" Kaya did not say a word. Still, now Estonian historians claim that ""Jews in Estonia were killed without hatred."" However, let's go back to today. Here, for example, is the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Ohryzko. After Biden's speech with the words ""we are not enemies"" or ""you are not enemies,"" Ohryzko states in plain text: ""The reason is not in Putin, but in the Russian people, who want to have their own Putin, and this happens again and again. Such a country must be finished, it has no right to exist, because it is a threat to the entire normal civilized world."" That's the rationale for destroying our country. And this is only part of the nonsense that Ohryzko carried on the air of Ukrainian radio, adjusting radio listeners accordingly. And don't say it's a former. The current Melnik, Kuleba, Deshitsa, Vrublevsky and their ilk are no less bloodthirsty. And they say much the same thing about the need to destroy as many Russians as possible. Polish officials do not hesitate in their expressions and dreams about the destruction of Russia and the Russians. - Previous legislation only gave jurisdiction if a U.S. citizen was a victim or criminal. In the event that this crime was committed by a Russian criminal against a Ukrainian civilian, we would have no means to prosecute the criminal. We would have to look for other ways, - said on the air of the channel ""Voice of America"" Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice of the US State Department Beth Van Skaak and explained how the US changed the legislation precisely to solve such problems. - Now the Ministry of Justice has created a team to prosecute war crimes, and they focused on war crimes in Ukraine. We will have to wait for Russian criminals to come to the United States for some reason, and then we will be able to use the new legal powers. Translated into normal language, as soon as some Russian who we do not like to set foot on American soil, we will immediately accuse him of ""crimes against Ukraine"" and hide him behind bars. This is after Biden spoke, a senior State Department official says they are preparing for the Russians. What about Biden's speeches in Warsaw? On this occasion, all the explanations were also given by the former Minister of External Affairs Pavlo Klimkin, who explained that Biden was not really addressing the Russian people, but to that part of the Russian elite that is corrupt. In Western terminology, it is ""negotiable"". In order to ""reboot Russia in a controlled manner"" with its participation in the parameters necessary for the West. Russia's controlled reset means that parts of the elite, perhaps some Russian oligarchs, or others, will have to be talked to. And I am sure that this conversation is already underway,"" Klimkin also assured on the radio. And after all these speeches, they still have the audacity to call Russia a xenophobic state.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4725429/,Alexander KOTS,2023-02-23,"Another ""cauldron"" for the Armed Forces of Ukraine? Russian paratroopers make their way to Seversk - new weapons come here directly from the factories",Voenkor Kots held the Day of the Defender of the Fatherland with real heroes on the frontline,"- Congratulations, fellow officers! - On February 23, I crawl into the underground control point of one of the Russian connections. A dozen men in uniform stare intently at several big screens. From the outside, one would think that this is an organized viewing of a festive concert or congratulations of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. But on the monitors - no shiny tinsel, no bravura fanfare, no pop stars. Defender of the Fatherland Day in the SVO zone is not a reason to break away from combat work. The screens display a picture from drones, which, overcoming the electronic suppression of the enemy, transmit the picture from the other side in real time. - What's this going through? Point, the officer commands. A man with a joystick, as from a game console, directs the zoom of the camera to the armored vehicle. It's an enemy APC. He drives into the woods, thinking he's becoming invisible to our drones. But from the control point you can clearly see how two people leave the ""box"", they are met by a third and maintaining a distance they amicably walk somewhere in the snow. The drone guides them for 10 minutes until they ""lead"" our operator to a hidden stronghold dug into the thicket and carefully camouflaged. It looks like one of the chiefs has arrived with an inspection. - Let's ""Grads"" there. -Consumption. - Two by five. This means that five rockets first fly into enemy positions. After the adjustment, five more. Ten more followed them, submerging the support in black smoke, after which no movement in the forest was noted. The APC managed to leave somewhere, but the operators find a new target - an artillery gun similar to the American howitzer M777. This time, communications from the control room reach the operators of the Lancet loitering ammunition, which are based a few kilometers from here. Minutes later, there is already footage of the defeat at the control point, shot by a kamikaze drone. Actually, this is ideally how the notorious RUK should look like - a reconnaissance and strike circuit. When control, artillery, drones, and assault squads of different units work as a single organism. But a few months ago, the resistance line here, near Kremennaya, was bursting at the seams. The enemy really threatened to break through the defenses and enter the rear of the Lugansk People's Republic. And in the autumn, following the Kharkiv region, we could lose part of the LPR. However, airborne units were hurriedly transferred here, to which I came to visit on a festive morning. It was they who were able to stop the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And those who arrived in the paratroopers mobilized did not just stabilize the line of defense. Today, they, along with the career military, are moving forward, occupying more profitable lines and squeezing out the positions lost last year. Paratroopers today operate almost the entire Svatovsky line, moving both towards Liman and to Belogorovka. At the same time, they can boast of new weapons that are transferred to the troops directly from factories. The same ""Lancets"" - domestic kamikaze drones - have been very active in this direction in recent weeks. They get where artillery can't fire. ""Or the brand new BMD-4 (combat vehicles of the landing force - Ed.) came to us, ""Berezhok"" again - very worthy machines, - tells me an officer of the 76th Guards Airborne Division. Together we went to one of the sections of the front, on which his subordinates operate. Also from among the mobilized. - Are your ideas about combat very different from reality? - I ask Sergey from the Kemerovo region, the commander of the BMP-2M (infantry fighting vehicle. - Ed.) ""Berezhka"" with the inscription on board ""Kuzbass is a force!. - Well, no one was waiting for a ""kindergarten"" here, everyone understood that this was not a childish prank. Supostat is strong, no one feels sorry for anyone. Well, no one canceled cunning and military ingenuity. We have the necessary weapons, we are crushing the enemy. ""Berezhok"" is the second birth of the good old BMP-2. Only in addition to the usual 30-millimeter gun, it now has four Kornet anti-tank complexes, a large-caliber machine gun and an automatic grenade launcher. And all four ""Cornets"" the car can spur in one point. And at the range, the mobilized practiced shooting with a ""doublet"". It will certainly come in handy when NATO-style tanks appear on the contact line. The same ""Abrams"" with one missile can not be taken. And when two, yes, in one place - the chances are much greater. And the armor of the BMP-2M is more serious. ""Recently, they came under mortar fire, grabbed a charge under the ""goose"" - the car is intact, the whole crew is healthy, - says Sergey. - And of course here the internal equipment is of a completely different class. Thermal imagers, night vision devices, and a fire control system are all very accurate and reliable. At night we work without problems. Six years ago, Sergei served as a ""conscript"" in the Far East, in the 83rd Airborne Assault Brigade. After the ""dembele"" he was an individual entrepreneur - metal acceptance, construction. According to him, when the summons was handed, he had no doubts. - If we don't go against the supostat, it will soon be standing at our gate. I don't want my family to suffer from this. - This is probably the first such holiday in your life. Attitudes towards him have changed. - More pride in the native army. I want to congratulate my family, colleagues and comrades in arms. Health to you and most importantly - patience. We will definitely win. As in Artemovsk (Bakhmut), the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer huge losses near Kremennaya. At the same time, they cling to each bush and are constantly looking for opportunities to counterattack. The enemy is trying to crush the positions of our paratroopers and motorized riflemen in small maneuver groups. If it gets really hot, armored groups come to the aid of our infantry. Several cars roll out on direct fire and literally stitch the forest in front of them. As a rule, after the ""command performance"" of our BMDs and BMPs, the offensive fuse of the enemy fades. - Sometimes it is easy to push the opponent, sometimes it is very difficult, but be that as it may, we go forward. We have one goal. Where it is hard to endure, where it is easier to take a break. We work as artillery or armored groups. Reconnaissance gives us the coordinates, coordinates our actions from the air, we leave, suppress the enemy's fire, and under our cover the infantry comes,"" another mobilized man tells me. Oleg from Omsk, also served in the Airborne Forces, in the 137th regiment in Ryazan as a mechanic-driver. On the ""citizen"" he worked as a master for the shipment of finished products. - After the army, of course, I celebrated February 23, without really thinking about the essence. And now I understand that I am literally defending my homeland. - On cars! - Sounds like a command. And Oleg and his crew in a column of three combat vehicles move forward for another task in the area of the Torsk salient, where Russian paratroopers push the enemy towards Seversk and Belogorovka. From the east, the enemy group is crushed by motorized riflemen and units of the 2nd Army Corps of the LPR, from the south by groups of PMCs ""Wagner"", which in parallel form a ring of encirclement around Artemovsk. ""The initiative is now on our side,"" one of the commanders told me. - If earlier I felt like a goalkeeper in training, who jumped from one corner to another, plugging holes, now in this position I am an opponent. The main thing is to move so that he does not have the opportunity to concentrate strike groups in some direction. Let the APU now jump all over the ""goalkeeper"". LISTEN AS WELL.

How poems are born in our time,"When guns rumble, the muses are not always silent. Everyone remembers the famous poems that appeared during the Great Patriotic War - take at least ""Wait for Me"" by Konstantin Simonov or ""Zemlyanka"" by Alexei Surkov. And a special military operation gives rise to poems. Sometimes he even makes people poets. We chose three authors who write about the fighting. Anna, 34, is a military officer and an experienced poetess: she has already published seven books. And she was originally going to devote her life to chemistry. Russian by nationality, Anna was born in Kharkov (and recalls that already in her childhood she fought with classmates-nationalists, fans of the SS division ""Galicia""). Then she studied in her hometown at the Faculty of Chemistry, was going to enter graduate school, but it did not work out: by that time, her two hobbies, poetry and games (computer and role-playing) took too much time. And Anna tried herself in journalism, and then left Ukraine for Russia, to St. Petersburg, with which she fell in love at first sight. But soon the war in the DPR and LPR entered her life. She began to correspond with her friend, who commanded an artillery battery, came to him in Lugansk as a bride - and learned that he had been shot. This became a terrible tragedy for her, she began to have a severe depression - she remained in Lugansk and wanted to die there. But, fortunately, I gradually climbed out. And I started writing articles about the fighting. There was a lot in her life: a marriage with sniper Andrei Kutsky (Miloslavsky), met in Donetsk (alas, the marriage was romantic, but short, and in 2019 Andrei died), moving to Russia (according to Dolgareva, she could no longer look at the death of civilians on the battlefield), volunteer work during the coronavirus pandemic ... Periodically, she went to Donbass. And with the beginning of the special operation, she again turned into a war correspondent. She also raises money to help Russian fighters. There was an amazing case: she met a scout who twice stepped on a mine: the first time he lost his leg, the second time - a prosthesis that he had installed. The new prosthesis was unsuccessful, there were chances that he would permanently sit in a wheelchair. Anna announced a fundraiser - and the necessary amount (very large) was collected in a matter of hours. Now this man is back on the front lines. BALAKLEYA, BALAKLIYA. PICK ME SOON. In endless chatter. The armor was hot. With rifle on tanks. Arrow, arrow. Deflect a blow. Into an unfamiliar height. Boys from Samara. From Ufa and Moscow. Mines are close. And the arm was tired. He asks for a firm hold. Our native military-industrial complex. An unfamiliar river. Autumn and grace. Automatic machine and first aid kit. It's not time to die. Sergey is 33 years old. He was born on Sakhalin, in the city of Kholmsk, and after school he moved to Stavropol, where he was engaged (now it is hard to believe) in modern dance. He also wrote poetry. And then he became a paratrooper. And... founded a literary club in his regiment. (By the way, among his favorite poets are veterans: Eduard Asadov, Konstantin Simonov, Ilya Ehrenburg.. In 2022, he went to Ukraine to take part in a special operation. And in the same year he was accepted into the Russian Union of Writers: recommendations were given by the poet Igor Vityuk and the prose writer-marine painter, captain of the 1st rank Vladimir Shigin. They received Sergey almost instantly - in a few days. This poem,  based on real events, it was written in June 2022. THREE DAYS. I dedicate it to my friend. Alexandru Lugansky. You survived there. where death reigned supreme. She tortured you, my brother, for three days. You could give up, you could not tolerate it. But for you to die was not enough. Wounded, in the midst of smoke and fire. For three days you lay in a field by the road. When your dead friends. Already in paradise we talked with God. At night, waiting for dawn. You fought with someone else's. February cold. And to somehow pacify the thirst. You ate bloody snow and drank from a puddle. The fighting was raging off somewhere on the sidelines. Shells exploded, mines rang out. As you could barely breathe, you thought about your wives. And an unbaptized one-year-old son. On the third night, they found you. The sky played with starry buckshot. And even loud boos. They did not drown out the sounds of Russian speech. ... Live, my brother. all the deaths are evil. Over time, all wounds will heal. And you know, you're not just lucky. God has other plans for you. This guy is not a member of the Writers' Union and does not pretend to be one. He was met near Ugledar in the vostok battalion by Komsomolka's war correspondent Dmitry Steshin. One of the fighters said that Chuvash writes poetry. Dima asked him to read his favorite poem on camera. He was a little shy, but he read it. And the video published on the website of the KP.RU was watched by a huge number of people: this is real poetry from the trenches. The cold cuts, the metal cracks. It's heard somewhere nearby. We sit in the trench together. We believe that there will be peace soon. Through thorns to victory. We'll make our way. Although it's not easy for all of us now. It's going to get easier, friend. Every Russian is a soldier of God. The heart burns with flames. The cause is right for us. The evil enemy will be defeated. September - October 2022."

A few days ago, a Highmars flew to the temporary command post of the Vostok. I am well aware of what security measures were applied, I will not voice them, but it still did not help. As the head of the engineering service of the Leon battalion told me, there were two missiles. The first hit the building and destroyed the ceilings of three floors. The second ""Heimers"" was next, it fell strictly vertically, entered the ground, almost the entire length of the warhead and ... didn't work. A smiling and kind staff officer with the call sign ""Evil"" died (often call signs are given from the opposite - approx.corr.), just a couple of weeks ago, Andrei gave me tea in this basement. There could have been more victims, but the vaunted American technology failed. ""We don't know how or when this projectile might go off,"" Leon explains to me, ""who will get to it with pliers in naughty hands when peace is finally established here. I agree with the sappers that I will shoot in the basement, but my duty is to shine a lantern on them. And I light a candle while they assemble a sophisticated scheme of detonators and gently lower a bunch of mines into a vertical well. Somewhere at the bottom lurks overseas death and it is impossible to leave it alone, only to destroy. We retreat to the soldiers standing in the cordon, unwind the telephone wire-vole. One of the sappers hands me a helmet, saying, put it on, the scattering of debris cannot be predicted. The underground explosion came out deaf, part of the building folded, dry concrete dust pulled through the village. I went on, to the guys who were supposed to go to Ugledar tonight. I did not go empty-handed - in Rostov there is a group of volunteer girls, they call themselves ""pharmacy fairies"". From them I was handed a box with the inscription ""Bosiatsky fitting to Steshin and his friends."" There were lovingly and scientifically wrapped in parchment shmatas of lard, loaves of ""Borodino"", a set of sauces, cigarettes, lighters, a box of ""hematogen"" - for the prevention of colds. From myself, I reported several packs of the best coffee, and coffee is drunk here just without stopping. Moreover, there are many connoisseurs who understand the varieties and methods of brewing. Now it is easy to do – ""trench candles"" and gas burners have ceased to be exotic. As one of the fighters remarked to me: ""There is little snow, but you can always scrape together for coffee, and I always have a burner and a mug in the ""marauder"" (the so-called special pouch for dropping empty magazines, collecting all sorts of ownerless, but useful or interesting things – approx. Corr.. I caught the legendary fox scout doing a meditation session - he tastefully (that's how aesthetes try cigars), packed his backpack for a night out for rotation. I started the conversation with a stupidly provocative question. - Fox, there is a sense of celebration. The fox weighed one of his backpacks, he did not like the weight, and he remarked, like, ""the holiday is always with me."" On February 23, Lis planned to celebrate as befits a defender of the Motherland - on the front line. The fox said a few words to those who are now preparing at the training grounds. - Listen to everything, absorb. Make sure that the instructors do not ""pour water"", do not teach in the shooting racks to stand. Let them explain more about everyday life on the front lines. Hi I want to convey. -It's easy. - Hello to our medical training instructors. They talk about the ""golden hour"" (during which the wounded must be evacuated – corr.). So we have it for at least four hours. I now have to walk to the positions about 7 kilometers, no closer. In order to have no illusions, learn to provide primary assistance to yourself and your friends. At the last rotation, I met with the guys from Kamchatka, talked. I found out that they do not know how to apply a tourniquet. Like they taught, but they didn't learn. Yes, it's important. Let them buy rubber boots, do not hesitate. - Than you heat up. - Trench candles, gas burners. If the entrance is blocked by a blanket or a tent cloak, and it is minus ten outside, it will be +1 inside and it even seems that it is warm, almost hot. The offensive at Ugledar in the last week slowed down. Ours went to the so-called dachas on the outskirts of the city, clung to them and stood in the ""active defense"". Fox, in conversation, recalled that he only sees what is happening in his sector on the front lines. But, he happened to talk to the prisoners taken the other day and what he said did not really fit in his head. - I don't understand the behavior of the opponent. Captive reservists say that there are practically no young people in the trenches, they are knocked out. I emphasize, she did not desert, but was knocked out. The median age is 40 years. - Why did that happen. - Young people are more active, the first one dies. Here are from my observations: a Ukrainian dugout, a closed gap with a loophole in our direction. Near him are ""eyes"", an observer. Here he is just standing, leaning out of the trench to the waist. And I've come across this more than once. Either this inexperience, or the conscious actions of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, are engaged in the ""loss of personnel"". Don't understand. - They have big losses. - I generally have the impression that they have been brought here for slaughter lately. There is no other explanation. What struck me about the prisoners' stories. The word ""punishers."" They used it themselves. - In what context. - According to them, it turns out that ""punishers"" are brought to their positions and those who remain are also ""punishers"" who remain. Moreover, the routes are built so that they do not intersect, they are forbidden to communicate. Some were taken out, others were brought in. - Nonsense, out of logic. You take positions from the shifters, they tell you, like: ""Here we put the signal mines, here are the banners, there, on the left, a machine gunner appeared, working in the evening ..."". - It turns out that they are brought in and put in a pit without explaining anything. And there were such options - he was caught on the street, four days later he was already near Ugledar, and a week later he was notified that he died in the Donbass. I do not understand what task the Ukrainian command faces – the extermination of the male part of the population? It turns out that it is. Of course, no one on the front line will celebrate the Day of the Defender of the Fatherland, as it is customary to celebrate in peaceful years sometimes, forgetting its essence. But there were a few minutes of sincere joy - when they sorted out delicious gifts from the rear and read aloud a warm letter from the ""pharmacy fairies"". I do not know whether there is a similar holiday on the other side of the line of contact, most likely it was also canceled as part of the ""decommunization"". But about our holiday TAM know clearly. At exactly 12 o'clock, Donetsk was hit by ""Highrs"" and I finished the end of this report sitting on the floor, between the capital walls. It fell very close by, on Rosa Luxemburg Street, right in front of the entrance to the music school. There was no one there – after all, it was a holiday, and children in Donetsk had long been studying remotely. Three missiles intercepted our air defense, so the Center today did without casualties. This is, indeed, a very expensive gift for a front-line city. LISTEN AS WELL. Oleksandr Kots: The operation to liberate Artemovsk will take several more weeks (more)"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4725244/,Victor BARANETS,2023-02-23,Why does Russia actually stop participating in START-3? Top Reasons and Behind-the-Scenes Play,"How the United States is cunning with the nuclear Treaty, preparing a ""lightning"" and ""disarming"" strike on Russia","This ""information bomb"", which has become the main military sensation of recent days, sounded in Vladimir Putin's Address. Russia stops its participation in the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms (START-3). Why was this decision made? And what it can lead to. Let's find out. The first START-1 Treaty was signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and George W. Bush in July 1991, three weeks before the GKChP putsch. Now between Russia and the United States there is already a third version of the Treaty - START-3. It was signed in 2010 by Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama. The contract was designed for 10 years with the possibility of extension for another 5 years. And it was really extended - until February 2026. START-3 provides for a reduction for each of the parties of the deployed nuclear warheads to 1550. And intercontinental ballistic missiles, including submarines and heavy bombers - up to 700 units (it is clear that each missile can have several warheads that separate upon approach and hit many targets at once). According to the US inspection, Russia has 527 missiles. And they have 1458 deployed warheads. The United States, according to Russian inspectors, had 598 missiles. And 1498 deployed warheads. As we can see, both countries have reduced their nuclear missile forces even below the bar of the Treaty. But a slight superiority was (and still is) in the United States. Putin in his Address mentioned that the Treaty should take into account nuclear weapons not only of the United States, but also of other NATO countries. Namely, France and Britain. Why. Because in the event of a conflict with Russia, London and Paris will unfurl their missiles at the first snap of their fingers from Washington. According to the Stockholm Peace Institute, France today has 101 missiles and 290 warheads. Britain has 76 missiles and 225 warheads. If we sum up the nuclear potentials of the United States, France and great Britain, then, as we see, they are already seriously superior to the Russian one. Moreover, Britain and France do not just possess nuclear weapons, but they are also aimed at Russia. All this grossly violates the principle of equal security, written in the same START-3 Treaty. But this issue, raised by Moscow, the Americans have so far repeatedly left out of brackets. From the very beginning of START-3, the Americans tried to ""chemicalize"". For example, our inspectors were not allowed to fully test nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines. Like, and a partial inspection is enough. Then they refused to inspect the Russians those nuclear facilities that were declared (which contradicted the provisions of the Treaty). In the end, these mockeries bothered the specialists in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. An interesting detail: after the extension of START-3, the United States never allowed us to visit us with a nuclear inspection. There was information that the state of their mine-based nuclear forces was deplorable. I think that's the reason why we weren't allowed in. Apparently, they didn't want us to find out that they weren't as rosy as they claimed. On the other hand, the United States quietly continued to increase the number of both missiles and warheads. By the end of 2020, they had 675 carriers and 1457 warheads. To all the claims of the Russian side in this regard, they only shrugged their hands. They were also cunning in another way. No matter how hard our experts fought, they could not convince the Americans that it was unfair to count one heavy bomber for one nuclear charge in the Treaty. After all, in fact, one board can carry up to 24 missiles or bombs. The United States has more heavy bombers than Russia, and the real ratio of charges thus was 2100 for Russia, and about 2400 for the United States. But that's not all. By February 5, 2018 (the treaty's target date), Russia had fully fulfilled its obligations to reduce its nuclear forces. The Americans, on the other hand, went to tricks. Unilaterally excluded from the offset 56 launchers from the submarines ""Trident-II"" and 41 bombers B-52N. Why? The U.S. said it had refurbished them. In addition, they called several mines ""training"" and also did not include them in the test. The result: the United States exceeded the number of nuclear carriers allowed by the Treaty by 101 units. And now even more. After 2018, Moscow repeatedly raised the issue of extending START-3, but the White House tried to ""reform"" it in its favor - demanding that Russia include all its latest hypersonic missiles in the Treaty. This would deprive Russia of the opportunity to counter the nuclear advantage of the United States, coupled with France and Britain. Another important point here is that the United States and NATO are openly acting against us in Ukraine today. They say out loud that their goal is the defeat of Russia. And at the same time, they want our nuclear facilities... control. Found simpletons. In his Address, Putin said: ""Some figures in Washington, we know for sure, are already thinking about natural tests of their nuclear weapons, taking into account the fact that the United States is developing new types of nuclear weapons. Such information is available."" Indeed, in recent years, the United States has been actively developing low-yield nuclear charges. They want to adapt them to hypersonic systems (which the Americans are also urgently doing, trying to catch up with Russia in this). The main task is that such a missile should reach the territory of Russia as soon as possible, bypassing our missile defense system. They already have a project of a 2-stage missile that accelerated the warhead so that it reached the target at a speed of 5-6 times faster than sound, destroying it with a direct blow. Now they are working on this project. But theory is one thing, and practice is another. It is important for the Americans to understand what the real effect will be from the explosion of such a warhead, which in flight ""scalds"" with a frenzied temperature - up to 3 thousand degrees. The United States is also creating superweapons against Russia's nuclear arsenal. According to their idea, it will be able to hit most of our nuclear potential even before Moscow makes a decision on a counter strike. That is, we see attempts by the Americans to develop a nuclear war scheme that would allow them to be the first to launch massive strikes against Russia without fear of retaliation. In this situation, Putin said in his Address, ""the Ministry of Defense and Rosatom must ensure readiness for the testing of Russian nuclear weapons. We will not be the first to do this, but if the United States conducts a test, then we will do it."" Very possibly, there was a hint of completely new and high-precision nuclear weapons of various capacities. Now that the U.S. says its goal is to ""inflict a strategic defeat on Russia,"" and other nuclear-armed NATO countries have joined those threats, our continued adherence to START-3 with the admission of U.S. inspectors to our nuclear facilities makes no sense. Under these conditions, Russia simply untied its hands. And here the question arises: is there a danger that the world is moving to a new round of the nuclear race? Experts say: it is not Russia that sets these impulses for the transition to a new state of the world order, it is not we who are destroying nuclear parity. The U.S. is doing it. Putin also mentioned this in his Address. We can assume that this is about our newest strategic silo-based missile system of the 5th generation ""Sarmat"". The ""orbital bombardment"" technology embedded in this missile makes it possible to strike at the enemy's territory along a suborbital trajectory through the South Pole of the Earth, bypassing the deployed American THAAD anti-missile batteries. The Avangard (Yu-71) guided warheads used in this product are unparalleled in the world. LISTEN AS WELL. The West is ready to spend all the money of the world on the destruction of Russia (more)"
KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4724134/,Vladimir DEMCHENKO,2023-02-23,"Biological weapons, plans to invade Russia and the Minsk deception: Six facts that prove that the special operation was necessary",There are facts that prove that Russia could not delay,"If recently someone still doubted the need for a special operation to protect Donbass, today much has become clear. Facts have emerged that confirm that extreme measures were required. And there was no time to delay. When Vladimir Putin announced the recognition of the DPR and LPR, Ukrainian artillery was already shelling cities and militia positions. It was an artillery preparation before the offensive. Children, women and the elderly were evacuated from Donetsk deep into Russia. If it were not for the special operation, the fighting would still have begun, but on our territory. Yes, exactly: near Avdiivka in an abandoned dugout, Russian special forces found a map, the marks on which unequivocally indicated the plans of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to attack Taganrog and even Rostov-on-Don. To what other territories the appetites of the warriors of the independent country extended, it remains to be guessed. Back in the noughties, long before the Maidan, there was popular speculation among Ukrainian nationalists that the entire Russian South, including kuban and Stavropol, should be Ukrainian. It seems that the current Ukrainian authorities share these ideas. Ukraine was not going to negotiate the fate of donbass with Either Russia or anyone else. The entire Minsk negotiation process was only a way to buy time to prepare for war. After the start of the special operation, the masks were dropped. Poroshenko, Zelensky, Frau Merkel and Monsieur Hollande publicly admitted that all these Normandy formats were needed only to delay time and give Kiev the opportunity to arm itself. But the agreements were approved in the UN Security Council... In the hands of the Russian military got documents that more than three dozen secret biological laboratories operate on the territory of Ukraine. U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland confirmed that the laboratories exist. She was very concerned that the research materials could fall into the hands of our military. Russian experts conducted an investigation. And the head of the radiation, chemical and biological protection troops of Russia, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, said: the Pentagon was aimed at creating components of biological weapons and testing them on the population of Ukraine and other neighboring states with Russia. ""An example is the experiments related to HIV infection, which were conducted by American specialists in Ukraine since 2019,"" the general said. All this crap would sooner or later be on our territory. And in the United States, only hands would be spread: we have seen nothing, we do not know anything ... Over the past months, all doubts about who we are fighting have disappeared. Not with Ukraine, but in Ukraine. With the help of the independent West, it is trying to weaken Russia as much as possible. And in a favorable scenario for them - to defeat. Anti-Russian sanctions and speculation that our country in its current form should cease to exist, the supply of tanks and heavy weapons, the provision of intelligence from satellites, the undermining of Nord Stream and Western mercenaries on the frontline, the disruption of negotiations and the blessing of Ukraine to fight to the last Ukrainian - all this for one goal - to bring Russia to its knees. Just the other day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that for the Alliance, hostilities began in 2014. ""In fact, since 2014, NATO has implemented the largest reinforcement of collective defense in a generation,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference in Brussels. - This is the largest adaptation of the Alliance, the introduction of increased readiness of our forces, strengthening on the eastern flank, increasing the number of exercises. For eight years, NATO has tried by all means to master Ukraine militarily, to get closer to our borders. If the special operation had not started earlier, it would have had to be started now. But stopping the advance of the North Atlantic Alliance would be even more difficult. During the special operation, the Ukrainian and Western elites more than once ""highlighted"" plans for the ""arrangement"" of the defeated Russia. Take, for example, the so-called ""Budanov map"", in which the head of Ukrainian intelligence Kirill Budanov presented his vision of the territorial division after the victory of Ukraine. From Russia on this map would remain a small piece in the European part. The Urals and Siberia should become a Central Asian republic, and the entire Far East should go to China. Ukraine in these plans regains the Crimea and Donbass and even goes further. In the West, they have long dreamed of turning our country into a puzzle of specific principalities, so the ""Budanov map"" probably appealed to many there. Pumping Ukraine with weapons and supporting offensive attempts can be considered a stage in the implementation of this plan. Relations between Russia and Ukraine after 2014, of course, did not ooze warmth. But most of us only after the start of the special operation realized how much the consciousness of the inhabitants of Ukraine had changed during these eight anti-Russian years. In kindergartens at matinees, children there sang about the murders of Moskals, guys enrolled in natsbats and stabbed Nazi tattoos. The demolition of Soviet monuments, the glorification of Bandera and other inhuman murderers... Russia's clash with SUCH a Ukraine was inevitable. And if a fight cannot be avoided, then, as coaches teach beginners in hand-to-hand combat, you need to beat first. IN THAT. Last February, Zelensky spoke in Munich at a security conference. And he hinted that he could return Ukraine to the status of a nuclear power. A few months later, the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to arrange a provocation with the so-called ""dirty"" bomb - it has nuclear components. And recently, the former commander of the Polish ground forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, admitted that Ukraine already possesses nuclear weapons. Maybe there's something we don't know about it. And what about the trend of recent days: the Armed Forces of Ukraine from drones drop containers with chemistry on our positions, and the West will not even threaten with a finger. Was it really necessary to wait until Zelensky moved from words to deeds? By taking a wait-and-see attitude, we risked getting a state hostile to Russia with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, which is also passionately eager to join NATO. LISTEN AS WELL.

Well, it's so hard to evaluate. But there are obvious things: no matter what negotiations with the West are going on now, there is no trust in our opponents. And that's very serious. Of course, we overlooked Ukraine. And, probably, the policy towards our neighbors was not quite thought out. I know Ukraine well. I have chess schools there and friends. He has been friends with Odessa since 1961. Imagine, 60-plus years! In general, we did not have a confrontation before the collapse of the USSR, and then we overlooked it. - We will restore the former, friendly relations with the Ukrainians. - I think so. But Ukraine is under a lot of pressure from the other side. And, of course, it hurts that the closest neighbors are in the trenches against each other. Other than the Civil War, I don't know of such times. And yet the mind must turn on at some point.

In the Donetsk direction, assault squads with the support of Tula paratroopers, assault aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, artillery fire and heavy flamethrower systems of the Southern Group of Forces. They inflicted such damage on the enemy: up to 250 Ukrainian servicemen killed and wounded, five armored vehicles, six cars, a D-20 howitzer and an ammunition depot of the 68th Infantry and Jaeger Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the South-Donetsk direction, the Vostok group of troops destroyed up to 65 Ukrainian servicemen, BMPs, two armored vehicles, two pickups, D-20 and D-30 howitzers. In the Kherson direction, two D-30 howitzers were destroyed during the day. Kirill Budanov, head of Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate, says decisive battles will take place between April and May. So he said in an interview with Forbes: ""From the middle to the end of spring there will be decisive battles. At the same time, the head of the DIU affirmatively answered the question whether during these battles ""the fate of the entire conflict will be decided."" So that's what Ukraine is hoping for! Budanov expects German tanks and American missiles to help them make a good mine in a bad game. A few bloated characters from France, Poland, and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries thought much the same. However, everyone ended badly. However, knowledge of history has never been a strong point among the Pagliacci. Colonel Douglas McGregor, a former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, believes that Poland, as well as Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Finland may soon be new parties to the conflict in Ukraine. He explained that if Washington decides to use the territory of Poland to launch missiles or other military actions against Russian forces, then ""Warsaw will become a participant in the theater of operations."" And after it it will affect the Baltic States and Finland. McGregor said that the Finns and Balts are unlikely to allow the United States to use their territory as a springboard for strikes against Russian forces, but the Poles may take a chance. Well, who did not take risks, did not experience the three partitions of Poland. Alexander Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, said that the authorities of Ukraine will demand from Sony, Microsoft and Valve to ban sales of the computer game Atomic Heart to the Russian studio Mundfish. Ukrochinovnik said that the development of the game took place ""with money originating from Sanctioned Russian enterprises and banks."" Even in Kiev, they are afraid of the threat of ""data collection"" of users, as well as the ""potential use of money raised from the purchases of the game to conduct hostilities"" against Ukraine. Bornyakov also pointed out that the developers of Atomic Heart did not publicly condemn Russia's policy. From what tubes do these sheep Dolly pop out. A member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region, Vladimir Rogov, said that the United States is forcing the Kiev regime to launch an offensive in the southern direction. Rogov attributed Biden's zeal to an attempt to score political points before the election campaign to demonstrate himself as the arbiter of peace. Does the American leader know what the ""southern direction"" is? It's not Kabul, Baghdad, or even Havana. Because of the hacker attack in three regions of Russia, false information about the air alarm and the threat of a missile strike was heard on the radio. According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, hackers broke into the servers of several commercial radio stations and launched information about the alleged announcement of an air raid alert. The authorities of the Voronezh, Belgorod and Kurgan regions also refuted the fake about the threat of a missile strike, which was broadcast on several radio stations at once. Here is what the government of the Voronezh region reported: ""This message is a provocation of accomplices of the Kiev regime and does not correspond to reality. The situation in the region is controlled and without incident. We kindly ask Voronezh residents to remain calm and not to panic."" And no one panicked, except for hackers, whose addresses soon became known. Sergei Aleinik, deputy head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, said that the conflict in Ukraine, which significantly complicated the international situation, had become a proxy war of the West against Russia. In his opinion, the conflict in Ukraine is the result of the policy of Western countries, which is based on ""maximum control over territories and entire peoples, the desire to possess all the world's resources."" Well, we kind of know about resources. As part of a new package of military assistance to the independent, Washington sent Kiev modified long-range Jdam-ER gps-guided bombs with a flight range increased to 72 kilometers. The Jdam-ER can be attached to unguided bombs weighing up to 907 kilograms. After dropping, the bomb opens its wings and plans up to 70 kilometers. And Kiev naively plans that this will help them. Over Mariupol, the air defense system destroyed two drones. The city administration reported: ""On the night of February 22, a flight of two unidentified drones was recorded near Mariupol. The air defense system recorded the targets in a timely manner and worked on them."" These drones have become street children. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4725148/,Lev ZAITSEV,2023-02-23,A man with a mighty Russian soul: How a special operation opened the country to the singer SHAMAN,"The star of modern Russian music believes that his songs do not belong to the patriotic genre. ""They are from the heart, this is my worldview,"" the singer said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda.","Yaroslav Dronov, a native of the city of Novomoskovsk (which is located in the Tula region), tried to break through to fame several times. A graduate of the Faculty of Jazz and Pop Singing Gnesinka in 2013 participated in the show ""Factor A"", where Alla Pugacheva drew attention to him. And the following year he took part in ""The Voice"" - at a blind audition, Pelageya and Dima Bilan turned to him (he chose Pelageya as a mentor, eventually reached the final and took second place). But to say that Yaroslav after that became a famous singer, will not work. He became famous last year, when his song ""Let's Get Up"" appeared. Its premiere, as it happened, took place on February 23, the day before the start of the special operation. ""LET'S GET UP. While you and I are still alive. and the truth is ours. Someone is looking at us from above. with native eyes. They smiled like children. and they stepped into the sky. Get up. And we will become closer to them. The song - the first patriotic in the work of Yaroslav - was dedicated to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. But it very successfully resonated with the mood of thousands of Russians. A few months later, it sounded - in its entirety! - in the program ""News of the Week"". To date, it has 37 million views on YouTube. And in January 2023, Nikolai Rastorguev said that it could be considered ""the anthem of the special operation."" And soon there was a song with the chorus ""I am Russian, I go to the end // I am Russian, my blood from my father // I am Russian, and I am lucky // I am Russian, the whole world is evil..."" It also became a huge hit. The great composer Eduard Artemyev in one of his last interviews said: ""I was very much hooked, and for real. SHAMAN has a mighty soul. ""I'm Russian"" is a very good song. And it's a great joy to have such a person on our stage."" And Yaroslav, who performs under the pseudonym SHAMAN, quickly turned into one of the main stars of the Russian stage. This year, he performed in the ""New Year's Light"" of the First Channel immediately after the congratulation of the president and the battle of the chimes - an honor that few were honored with. Where did the pseudonym SHAMAN come from? Just fans considered his vocals some kind of shamanic, magical, wrote about it in the comments. (In fact, paganism is not close to Yaroslav - he professes Orthodoxy and believes that religious motives are in all his songs, at least in the form of a hint. In an interview with KP, he said: ""It so happened that I made my way through on my own. None of my colleagues in show business have ever helped me. So I've never had any contact with them. I've trodden my path, and I'm comfortable because that's where I met my audience. And strangely enough, I promoted and continue to promote my songs via the Internet."" And again: ""When people tell me that I have a patriotic song, I don't really like being pushed into the category of genres. Because for me it is not a patriotic song, but a song from the heart, this is my worldview. In early 2023, SHAMAN performed in a special military operation zone. More precisely, he first sang in front of the wounded in the military hospital of Podolsk, and then - in front of the servicemen in the Kherson region. ""The guys in response thanked me for the performance in their own way - they gave a welcome salvo into the sky from their machine guns and machine guns,"" he wrote in his telegram channel."

Our girls decided to please you, because in the process of recovery, a positive mood is very important, because cheerfulness of spirit contributes to this, ""said Tatyana Shevtsova. This visit of pupils of the Ministry of Defense of Russia to the hospital is not the first.

Most of the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), killed and captured in the battles in the south of Artemivsk, represent the regions of the western part of the former Soviet republic. Lieutenant Colonel of the People's Militia of the LPR in retirement Andrei Marochko said that the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are growing due to the lack of special equipment for the evacuation of the wounded. The military expert drew attention to the fact that the NATO equipment received by Kiev is not equipped for this purpose. Pushilin's adviser Igor Kimakovsky said about the risk of an epidemic due to the explosion of the dam in Artemovsk by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It will also create difficulties in the delivery of food to the city. Russian troops inflicted a comprehensive defeat on the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Ugledar and Nikolsky. The losses of Ukrainian troops exceeded 75 people. Ukraine puts its soldiers in cages as punishment for offenses. A video of one of these incidents appeared on the network.

The European Union finally agreed, after which it published the tenth package of anti-Russian sanctions, which included. — Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia Tatyana Moskalkova. —Head of the HRC Valery Fadeev. — Head of Rossotrudnichestvo Evgeny Primakov. — Head of the Foundation for the Protection of National Values Maxim Shugaley. —Editor-in-chief of REGNUM Marina Akhmedova. — Deputy head of Roskomnadzor Vadim Subbotin. — Former head of the Federal Customs Service Vladimir Bulavin. — Russian doctor, public figure Leonid Roshal. — Journalist of ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" Alexander Kots. — Editor-in-chief of the TV channel ""Russia 24"" Evgeny Bekasov. — TV presenter, deputy general director of the First Channel Kirill Kleymenov. —Deputy General Director of NMG Alexander Akopov. —Military commanders Alexei Avdeev, Mikhail Teplinsky and Sergei Karakayev. — Ex-head of the Motor Sich plant arrested in Ukraine Vyacheslav Boguslaev. —Political scientists Sergey Kurginyan, Vitaly Tretyakov. — The head of the Israeli secret service ""Nativ"" Yaakov Kedmi. In addition, the European Union has forbidden to cooperate and conclude any contracts with the Ministry of Defense (MO) of Russia and our Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). And also many more enterprises and some large Russian banks fell under the restriction. Now the EU sanctions lists include 1386 citizens of the Russian Federation and 171 legal entities. - Fell under EU sanctions. Yes! - Alexander Kots wrote in his Telegram channel after the news of this. APU IS LIKE HITLER IN '45. The Armed Forces of Ukraine blew up a dam in Artemovsk (Bakhmut) to slow down the advance of fighters liberating this settlement. This was reported by RIA Novosti, citing its own source. - In the Kiev-controlled part of Artemovsk, the enemy really blew up the dam. Details are not yet available. Trying to complicate the advance of the fighters, - said the interlocutor of the agency. Judging by the stories of one of the commanders, we have about one thousand seven hundred meters left to the city center. As a result of the explosion of the dam, water poured into the homes of residents of the city, of which there are very few left. It has flooded basements, vegetable gardens in the private sector and is not leaving. In general, the Armed Forces of Ukraine did exactly as Hitler did in April 1945, when Adolf ordered to flood the subway in Berlin, where civilians of the city were fleeing, in order to complicate the advance of Soviet troops to the Reich Chancellery. ALL MINISTERS ARE IN ONE BUILDING. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal is going to reform the government, as reported in an interview with Forbes. Instead of 20 existing ministries, the prime minister intends to leave only 15-16. - ""The ideal model of the Cabinet of Ministers is 15-16 powerful ministries and 5-6 powerful deputy prime ministers. My dream is for the government to fit in this building on Hrushevsky Street,"" Shmygal said and shared plans to reform the auxiliary services. - It makes no sense in every ministry to keep an accounting department or units that prepare draft resolutions. This can be done in the secretariat responsible for bureaucratic tasks. - Ministries and ministers should do the main work - to form policy. To do this, they need small teams of quality analysts, assistants and the like, - Shmygal believes and plans to reduce spending on the state apparatus this year by at least 30%. THE GERMANS SCRATCHED THEIR FISTS. German expert on international law, university lecturer Klaus Kress told Der Spiegel that Germany has the right to intervene in the conflict in Ukraine and itself to start hostilities against Russia. ""On the basis of the right to collective self-defense, Germany could directly intervene in the conflict together with Ukraine,"" the teacher said. As he believes, only the indecision of German leaders stops Germany from direct participation in the conflict. Earlier, Vice Chancellor, Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection of Germany (formerly a children's writer) Robert Habeck already said that Russia can be brought to its knees only on the battlefield. And Klaus Kress stressed that, in his opinion, Germany is able to afford much more than it is doing now. Recall that Adolf Hitler also thought so. And his fists on Russia (then the USSR) itched too. And as a result, tens of millions of victims and the scarlet flag of victory over Berlin and over the burned corpse of the Führer. Do today's German leaders really want a repeat of this story. RUSSIA HAS STOPPED SUPPLYING OIL TO POLAND. Literally the next day after the delivery of the first 4 Leopard-2 tanks from Poland to Ukraine, a message came from Warsaw that Russia had stopped supplying oil to this country. - We effectively ensure the supply of raw materials. Russia has stopped supplying oil to Poland, for which we are fully prepared,"" said Daniel Obaitek, chairman of the board of the Orlen fuel concern, and boasted that in recent months Russia has supplied only 10% of Poland's total oil imports. Actually, we have no doubts. What Warsaw will find, than to replace the fallen oil, but 10% is not a small amount, and the second question is at what price the Poles will buy this oil from other sources. What this can result in, the Poles can ask the Germans. BASF IS CLOSING THE PLANT IN GERMANY. Global giant BASF is closing one of its two ammonia plants in Ludwigshafen. The reason is a sharp increase in energy prices in Europe and, in fact, for raw materials for the production of ammonia - natural gas. Gas from other producers due to its high cost makes production unprofitable. BASF plans to cut 2600 jobs at its facilities around the world, of which 700 jobs will be cut at plants in Germany. This is a very large figure, given the high-tech nature of production processes and the minimization of human labor in favor of automation. The company's economists estimate that this will save up to 500 million euros (or at least reduce losses within such an amount). It's really funny, isn't it Olaf Scholz. ONE LINE. - In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there is growing indignation at the decrease in salary payments. Many Ukrainian servicemen were charged about 30% of what they received before. - A group of four American strategic bombers B-52 Stratofortress, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, after the statement of the President of the Russian Federation on the withdrawal from the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms, arrived at the Moron air base in Spain. - The delegations of China and the Russian Federation blocked the joint communiqué of the ""Big Twenty"", which gathered for a meeting of finance ministers and heads of central banks at the summit in India, in which Western countries wanted to directly condemn the invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. - Britain has promised to allocate three thousand free tickets to Ukrainian refugees for Eurovision-2023, which will be held in Liverpool instead of Ukraine. Probably to the semi-finals and to the very back rows. - The European Union said that the bill on foreign agents, which is planned to be adopted in Georgia, the analogue of which is the same current law adopted in the United States in 1938, contradicts the conditions for obtaining the status of a candidate for the European Union. - The press service of Maia Sandu said that the President of Moldova during a recent stay in Warsaw asked Biden for money. But the US president was greedy, but Japan was generous and wrote chisinau a loan of $ 100 million. True, the parties kept the terms and conditions of the return of money secret. - The governor of the Penza region of Russia, Oleg Melnichenko, in response to the personal sanctions imposed on him by the United States, ordered to ban the entry of Joseph Biden and members of his family into the territory of his region.

Not in terms of climate, but in the sphere of political self-consciousness of the population. More than 25,000 people demonstrated in the morning to protest against the supply of German weapons to Ukraine. Moreover, according to eyewitnesses, representatives of both left-wing and right-wing political parties took part in the demonstration with banners with anti-war slogans. ""We call on the Chancellor to stop the escalation of arms supplies. Right away! He must lead a strong alliance for a ceasefire and peace talks at both the German and European level, protesters appealed to Olaf Scholz. It is unlikely that all these appeals will have at least some kind of response from the Chancellor himself or officials of his government, who are drifting completely in the direction dictated from Washington. But all this movement is quite strongly undermining the positions of the ruling parties in the light of future elections. As well as the fact that in a number of supermarkets in Germany, as on the eve and in the UK, there were interruptions with the already risen in price of vegetable products. But something in the ""machine of Western solidarity with Ukraine"" broke down and worked quite differently from what the organizers of the action planned. From early morning, Berliners were drawn to the wrecked combat vehicle. Both Russian emigrants and natural Germans God knows in what generation. And they all walked to the tank with flowers. With roses, tulips and real bouquets. Even the great-grandson of the first German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, Alexander von Bismarck, came, who also laid flowers on the tank. The tank almost completely disappeared under the bouquets. Those who arranged this planned to cover the tank and Russia with shame, and the combat vehicle that had served its purpose turned into a real memorial to the memory and valor of Russian soldiers. Moreover, the memorial is completely improvised, expressing the real moods and sympathies of ordinary Germans, without any order or coercion. To some extent, the makeshift tank monument took over from those monuments and memorials to Soviet soldiers who liberated Europe (and liberated it) from Nazism, which are now being demolished throughout Europe. And this carries such a deep symbolism that all the attempts of the German authorities. The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, the Baltic republics and other ""fighters"" against the so-called ""Soviet totalitarianism"" look completely wretched and illegitimate. Because ordinary normal people, as it turned out, remember everything. All that was. And everybody understands. Everything that's happening now. And the real sympathy and support of the people cannot be hidden behind the veils of double morality of their governments. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4725645/,Alexander GRISHIN,2023-02-24,What is happening in Transnistria and why Ukraine is trying to ignite a new conflict with Russia,Ukraine is deploying a group near the Ukrainian-Transnistrian border. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a warning on the situation in Transnistria,"""In connection with the significant accumulation of personnel and military equipment of Ukrainian units near the Ukrainian-Pridnestrovian border recorded by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the deployment of artillery in firing positions, as well as the unprecedented build-up of flights of unmanned aircraft of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the territory of Transnistria, we warn the United States, NATO member countries and their Ukrainian wards against the next adventurous steps,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said today. And yesterday, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation made a statement similar to this: ""The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is currently recording a significant accumulation of personnel and military equipment of Ukrainian units near the Ukrainian-Pridnestrovian border, the deployment of artillery in firing positions, as well as an unprecedented increase in flights of unmanned aircraft of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the territory of the PMR."" Both agencies warned that in the event of an attack on Transnistria, where Russian peacekeepers are located, the protection of our compatriots and military warehouses in the unrecognized republic will be provided with adequate funds. Two days, two statements. And, to put it mildly, not ordinary. The situation is really serious. And it all started about 3 weeks ago. Recall that on February 8, Zelensky was with a group of accomplices in London, spoke in parliament, showed his blouse to the king of Great Britain and, according to some sources, together with the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine and at the same time his right hand Andriy Yermak had a rendezvous at the headquarters of Mi-6 with the leadership of this special service. And the very next day, upon his return to Ukraine, he said that Ukrainian intelligence had allegedly intercepted documents on the preparation of a coup d'état in Chisinau by Russian terrorists, and that he had told Maia Sandu all the details of this insidious plan. The delirium, of course, was fierce. Many choked when they heard such nonsense. Allegedly, Chechen special forces from Russia flew to Turkey under the guise of rescuers from Russia, and they should return to Chisinau already allegedly under the guise of employees of the Moldovan Ministry of Emergency Situations. Realizing that this nonsense did not pass the test of reason and logic, Kiev proposed another option. Russia, they say, intends to seize the airport in Chisinau and, using it, wants to transfer troops to Moldova. There are no fewer questions here: Moldova is surrounded on all sides by countries, to put it mildly, unfriendly to us: Ukraine and Romania. It is impossible to fly to Chisinau through some no-man's-land or neutral airspace. The third version of the provocation looked more sane, but it was only a repetition of Hitler's provocation that unleashed the Second World War. According to this scenario, the soldiers of the special units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had to commit an act of aggression against Moldova, being dressed in Russian uniforms and using military equipment with the designations adopted for the SVO. Everyone had a good plan, but the Russian Defense Ministry revealed it in time and made it public. But Kiev has already gathered significant military forces from its side of the border. While these plans were being prepared and failed, Moldova quickly changed the government, while, by and large, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita, more focused on economic topics, left among the significant figures, and sandu's former adviser in the field of defense and national security replaced her in this post. A man with a distinct power accent. Who immediately after his appointment to the post of head of government said that Chisinau would seek the ""demilitarization of Transnistria"" and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from the territory of the republic. A separate question is where to take them, to Romania or to Ukraine? Which once again emphasizes the inadequacy of the character. But what's interesting now is something else. And what is there for all of them, in this Transnistria, with honey that is smeared, what draws them there so much? After all, everything described is clearly not a coincidence. It's a chain. And it was clearly not built in Kiev. And, most likely, where gentlemen perform fife-o-klock in impeccable costumes, and not in worn khaki T-shirts, like their recent guest. WHO NEEDS THIS SAUSAGE? AND WHY. Kiev does not hide its goals, which it wants to achieve in the course of provocation. The first task is to get ammunition from giant warehouses in the village of Kolbasna, which have been stored there since Soviet times. Although some experts are sure that all shelf life has already ended there, and the ammunition there is unsuitable for use for the same barrel artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ukrainian army is now wildly hungry in terms of shells and mines, and it is for the Soviet calibers of 122 and 152 mm. (for artillery) and 82 and 120 mm. (for mortars). Even if 10-15 percent are still in a usable state, this can provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine for six months, or even for a year. The second task that Ukraine sets for itself is the capture of a large number of Russian servicemen in captivity and the replenishment of the ""exchange fund"". If it does not work, then the destruction of the Russian military in order to deliver a powerful moral blow and block the negative effect of the failures that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been experiencing on the front line for a couple of months, if not more. The last ""peremog"", which Kiev passes off almost as a battle victory during the heroic battles, was the abandonment by the Russian military of Kherson, from which our troops came out without losses. Since then, the ""peremogs"" have somehow ended. There is also a third goal. Subjected to ""dastardly Russian aggression,"" Moldova will simply be obliged to request help – either from Ukraine or from neighboring Romania, which positions itself as a defender of the ""orphan and wretched"" Moldovans. And Bucharest is already a NATO country. The conflict abruptly goes to a completely different level. And here the desires of Zelensky and Kiev and the same London coincide. Kiev needs the direct participation of NATO allies with its military. Britain is also ready for a lot to make the conflict flare up as much as possible. There are elections coming soon, and Prime Minister Sunak's position, if not worse than the governor's, then clearly not better. As for Chisinau, the President of Moldova, a citizen of Romania, Maia Sandu, has not yet fully decided whether to decide on this adventure or not. On the one hand, its position is not great: ratings are flying into the abyss, the economy has more problems than achievements every ten. And here the external enemy and a victorious war can distract the people from the ""dastardly"" problems, and the plus will drop on the ratings. On the other hand, who said that the war would be victorious, Russia clearly will not leave this unanswered, and it remains to be seen how everything will turn out in the end. Maybe we will have to flee to Romania, if the people do not like such a provocation very much. The most interesting thing in all this is how Russia will react to the provocation. And here geography comes to the fore. The village of Kolbasna itself, next to which there are warehouses, is located in the north of the PMR in the Rybnytskyi district, and from the border with Ukraine to it from a kilometer from the north and up to one and a half kilometers from the east. For a sharp and unexpected attack with a powerful armored fist, this is not a distance. Moreover, the terrain there is completely flat, there are no natural obstacles from the east. Unlike in the west, where the natural barrier is in the form of the main river of the region - the Dniester. Strictly speaking, the Dniester is the border between Moldova and the PMR, which in itself is a defensive line. The number of Russian servicemen based in the PMR is estimated in different ways: from 2 to 5 thousand bayonets, but the second figure is doubtful. There are another 15,000 servicemen of the PMR itself, and it is argued that in the event of the outbreak of hostilities, the number of the army of the unrecognized republic can be quickly brought to 80 thousand people. But thank God, no one has checked this yet, there was no need. In addition, for most of the past peaceful years, Tiraspol was preparing to repel aggression from the west, from Moldova, and not from the east, where Ukraine is located. Russia, of course, can respond economically. For example, to completely block the gas pipeline through Ukraine to Europe. Block all ships that are in the Black Sea as part of the grain deal. But all this takes time, days, and even weeks. And the fate of Transnistria will be decided in time. There, the distance between Ukraine and Moldova in the widest place of the republic does not exceed 30 kilometers, and in the narrowest only 3 km. - you can go from one state to another in less than an hour. No serious defense can be built in such a space. A naval or airborne assault in the PMR is not possible. Planes will be shot down, landing ships will be sunk. And Russia is left with only one option – missile strikes. Only no longer point ""Calibers"", but something more weighty. You can, of course, try to break through the corridor to Odessa as quickly as possible, but this is also not fast and threatens with very large losses. But an ultimatum to Kiev that in the event of aggression, ""decision-making centers"" - administrative buildings and offices of the authorities - will be wiped off the face of the earth by pinpoint strikes can really work. For example, the government quarter on Bankova Street, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the headquarters of the SBU and the GUR (in the first, by the way, on Volodymyrska Street, the entire CIA station sits) and so on. But all this will clearly not be required if Kiev refuses to provoke. However, it is not known whether there is a chance for this, and what it is, if any. LISTEN AS WELL.

BY SANCTION. Russia has set an absolute world record for the sanctions imposed on the planet against our country. if until February 2022, the number of sanctions imposed on Russia was 2,754 restrictions, then after the start of the Special Military Operation in Ukraine, their number increased by another 11,327, and now it is ... (drumbeat) 14,081 sanctions. And tomorrow the United States plans to announce another new sanctions package. At the same time, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Bangalore, India, on the eve of the first meeting of high-ranking G20 financial officials, admitted that the Russian economy unpleasantly surprised her: after the introduction of numerous anti-Russian sanctions, it is in the best condition. While the sanctions still have some negative impact on Russia, she said, the Russian economy is doing better than might have been initially expected, Yellen acknowledged. UKRAINE HAS DENOUNCED AGREEMENTS WITH RUSSIA ON COOPERATION IN THE AZOV SEA. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine denounced the agreement with the Russian Federation on cooperation in the use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. For the termination of the contract, as reported by the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Zheleznyak, 303 deputies voted. Recall that the agreement provided for the freedom of navigation of ships under the flags of Ukraine and Russia, Russian-Ukrainian cooperation, including joint activities in the field of navigation, including its regulation and navigational and hydrographic support, fishing, protection of the marine environment. And how will we now be in Azov without Ukrainians? And if they forbid us everything there. POLAND IS AGAINST THE 10TH PACKAGE OF ANTI-RUSSIAN SANCTIONS. Poland intends to block the adoption of the 10th package of anti-Russian sanctions. Do not be surprised, but first find out the reason. According to the Polish leadership, the proposed sanctions are too weak to affect Russia. Earlier, the Polish ambassador to the EU said that Warsaw was disappointed with the tenth package of anti-Russian sanctions, specifying that first of all the republic is dissatisfied with the lack of restrictive measures against Rosatom. The final decision should be made by the Prime Minister of the Republic Mateusz Morawiecki.

British Environment Minister Theresa Coffey (by the way, the closest friend of ex-Prime Minister Liz Truss, famous for her ""knowledge"" in geography, got into a real scandal. Answering the question of why some British supermarkets limited sales of cucumbers and tomatoes due to shortages, she said that turnips could be an alternative to scarce vegetables. - It is important to make sure that we appreciate the features that we have in our country. Many people would now eat turnips,  instead of thinking about lettuce, tomatoes and the like,"" she told parliament and added that she understood the unrealizability of her wishes. ""I understand that consumers want to have year-round choices, and that's what our supermarkets, food manufacturers and manufacturers around the world want, the world is trying to satisfy. Previously very body-positive, as they say now, Teresa Coffey has already fallen into a similar scandal when she suggested that people who are struggling for food work more time or improve their professional skills. Let me remind you that such a phrase about the fact that if there is no bread, you need to eat cakes, has already staged a revolution in one European country. By the way, the author of the expression eventually lost her head. MOLDOVANS FOR NEUTRALITY. After the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation about the upcoming provocations by Ukraine in Transnistria, Moldova fell into the focus of public attention around the world. At the same time, as it turned out, intellect Group recently conducted a survey of Moldovan citizens, trying to find out their political preferences. The picture turned out to be very interesting. 43.3% of respondents were in favor of ""strengthening military neutrality, developing the army and non-interference in conflicts"". 16.3% of respondents were in favor of cooperation with the CSTO led by Russia. 12.1% of Moldovans asked to set a course for European integration. Only 8.7% of the survey participants were in favor of joining NATO, and even less - 7.7% - wanting to unite with Romania. But Ukraine also set an absolute anti-record: only 0.7% of respondents considered it possible to create a military alliance with it to ensure security. No, anything happens, of course, but there is less statistical error – you have to be able to do it that way. SO THE CHINESE HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF AMERICAN SANCTIONS. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland at the Washington Post Live event reported that the Biden administration will recently impose its restrictions on Chinese companies that evade anti-Russian sanctions. - Russians began to import 1000% more laptops, iPhones, dishwashers from third countries ... because they can disassemble this equipment to get the advanced chips that we denied them, to make more missiles, etc.,"" Nuland said. I wonder where, in this case, we put the laptops, washers and dishwashers that become junk. Vika would still be doing cookies, pies and bagels. She was much more professional there. ONE LINE. - The countries of the ""Big Seven"" decided that they would not spend frozen Russian assets until the end of the war. Of course, in the event that they are found. - In Kherson, there is no heating for the third day, because there is a breakthrough at the local CHP, and water is pouring out of the network. - Russian TV presenter Olga Skabeeva, Russian company Joint Stock Company ""Operating Organization of the Zaporizhzhya NPP"" and more than 1200 Russian servicemen became the objects of new sanctions of the Administration of President Joseph Biden. - The Pentagon announced a new package of military assistance for Ukraine in the amount of $ 2 billion. There is still no money to eliminate the consequences of the environmental disaster in Ohio. The U.S. House Oversight Committee has requested reports from the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the Agency for International Development (USAID), whose inspectors general (auditors) recently returned from Ukraine, for reports on the spending of $113 billion allocated to assist Kiev. - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, commenting on the ""peace plan"" for the settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, presented by Beijing, said that there is ""not much trust"" in China.

Most of them are fakes. Usually well thought out and orchestrated. The end of March last year. Suburb of Kiev. Russian troops are making a ""goodwill gesture."" As part of the negotiations with Ukraine, they are leaving Bucha in Istanbul. There comes the Ukrainian theroborona. And a few days later, there are photos and videos of dozens of corpses scattered right on the streets. This will be the loudest fake in history. The word ""Bucha"" will be a household word. The story was presented as follows: the Russian army shot civilians for no reason. Only a detailed examination of the footage that was carried out by journalists and bloggers turned out that the case was full of inconsistencies. But no one cared about them anymore. 1. Some of the dead are wearing white bandages. So people meant that they were civilians and did not fight against Russia. Why would the military kill a loyal population. 2. Most of the dead were with their hands tied: this, one might say, is the visiting card of the Ukrainian special services - binding and torture. Human rights activists have been writing about this since 2014. 3. In a video that appeared two days earlier, the ter defense squad is conducting a sweep in Bucha. The roads are clean, there are no corpses, as there are none in parked cars. Two days later, corpses littered the entire street. After that, a pilgrimage went to Bucha. First European officials, then Western journalists. And everyone tried to blame Russia as vividly as possible. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine demanded the immediate introduction of new sanctions, the President of the European Council Charles Michel promised support from the EU, Emmanuel Macron said that the ""genocide in Bucha"" is a reason to abandon coal and oil. ""The provocation from ukraine's Bucha has opened a new Pandora's box. It will become a starting point after which Russia can be accused of all mortal sins by any speculation,"" Sergei Markov, director of the Institute for Political Studies, said in an interview with KP. And he was right. Indeed, russia began to hang all the most terrible atrocities that can only happen. COINCIDENCE. Exactly in the days when this tragedy was unfolding, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, tweeted: ""In order for the German government to finally dare to put a little more pressure on Russia and tighten new sanctions, hundreds of Ukrainian civilians must be killed and women raped again. Okay."" ""The heroic defenders of the island of Zmeiny, who fell in an unequal battle with the Black Sea Fleet of Russia!"" the Ukrainian media trumpeted at the end of February last year. According to their Ministry of Defense, the matter was as follows: on February 24, Russian ships approached the island where the border outpost of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stood. They offered to surrender. The Ukrainian garrison ""sent a proposal far away..."". Then the rocket and artillery strike began. 13 Ukrainian border guards died brave deaths. Even Zelensky issued a special appeal: all the heroes, fell to the death of the brave, all a gold star. Posthumously. Just another day passed, and a miracle happened: the Ukrainian border guards were ""resurrected"". Our rescue tug Shakhtar came to Sevastopol. And from it descended safe and sound, in full health, 82 Ukrainian border guards. From that very Snake. They simply abandoned resistance and laid down their arms. Rape also appeared in the information space. They have become one of the dirtiest fakes about the Russian army. Hundreds and thousands of ""victims"" have been reported. And all in the brightest details, in completely sick variations. It looked something like this: ""A schoolgirl from Mariupol told her terrible story: ""Occupiers rape children, old people and corpses."" This is the real headline of one of the Ukrainian Internet portals. The author of the ""idea"" with rape is the Commissioner for the Protection of the Rights of Citizens of Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova. She became her guide to the minds of Ukrainians. And not only Ukrainians. Even in Europe, entire forums were gathered - at one such time, Zelensky's wife spoke about the ""atrocities"" of the Russian military. The first bell thundered in Poland. The hosts of the local TV channel directly asked the Commissioner for Children's Rights in Ukraine Daria Gerasymchuk: ""And how many victims?"" There was nowhere to lie: ""To date, the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine does not have a single confirmed fact of violence,"" Gerasimchuk replied. Then Denisova herself began to ask specific questions: ""Where?"", ""Who?"", ""When?"", ""Facts?"". She couldn't answer any of them. That's what burned. And she was fired. Later, Denisova admitted: they invented all these stories and statistics together with her daughter over a cup of tea. AND THEN THERE WAS THE CASE. ""My grandmother shot down a drone with a can of pickles. Yes. There are also such inventions. ""It happened a few days ago at dawn when she was sitting on the balcony smoking. "" I saw that something was moving slowly. At first I thought it was a wounded crow, but then I heard a buzz."" After that, the resourceful grandmother grabbed the first weapon at hand - a can of pickled cucumbers. As a result of an accurate throw, the drone was shot down and fell into the courtyard,"" the Ukrainian press wrote about the amazing case. And what about us. Most of the fakes were shattered by themselves because of their utter incompetence and stupidity. Others had to be debunked. Both the media and bloggers were actively involved in this work. In social networks, even specialized channels have appeared that are only engaged in exposing the flow of lies. In addition, the government has launched an information portal Explain.rf. It publishes proven news about the progress of the special operation and answers to the main questions that arise among the population. And for those who still do not relent and continue to breed lies, the State Duma introduced criminal liability. Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code ""dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces"" appeared. On it, you can get either a fine - up to one and a half million rubles, or a term of up to 15 years. And there are precedents. Whose ears stick out. The flood of these fakes is not just inventions on the Internet. This is a big campaign that is completely controlled by the West. This was on the air of the Radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" (97.2 FM) said the president of the analytical company ""Kribrum"" and a member of the Human Rights Council Igor Ashmanov. ""The operators are the so-called CIPsO - the Ukrainian Center for Information and Psychological Operations. It is operated by the 77th Special Information Operations Brigade from London.

What is the situation around the city and how are Russian forces advancing here? Military expert, lieutenant colonel of the People's Militia of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) retired Andrei Marochko on the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" spoke in detail about how the work of Russian forces in the zone of the special military operation is going. According to him, despite the holidays and weather conditions, all units continue to work and do it quite successfully. Commenting on the current situation in the area of Artemovsk (the old name of Bakhmut), where hostilities continue, the expert noted the importance of the village of Khromovo, which must be taken by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. - Indeed, our volunteer assault units are now working very effectively from the north of Artemovsk and in fact are advancing at a good pace, which suggests that Artemovsk, the group that is in it, may be in the operational environment almost in the near future. But here is a very important settlement - Khromovo, which we really need to take, or at least approach the heights that will allow us to observe the situation in it, since this road is still used by the enemy to supply the group in Artemovsk,"" Marochko said. The lieutenant colonel also focused on the fact that Artemovsk is one continuous fortified area, there is a complex terrain. - Again, low clouds do not allow in some cases to conduct additional reconnaissance with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles. But it also works in the direction of the enemy. So we can say that the forces are equalized, the military expert explains. At the same time, it is important to understand, Marochko believes, that Artemovsk itself is an industrial area, which affects the advance of the Russian military deep into the city. A network of industrial enterprises, labyrinths of factories, basements - all this will be used by Ukrainian militants in the same way as in Mariupol and in Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Rubizhne. In the settlement itself there is a non-ferrous metals plant, where there are underground passages and places where you can hide equipment or place personnel, which is what the Armed Forces of Ukraine use. ""Therefore, as long as they have the opportunity, they will use such natural shelters,"" the expert believes. On the air of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"" he also commented on the recent statements of the Ukrainian leadership that allegedly ""the Armed Forces of Ukraine will not hold Artemovsk at any cost."" Marochko noted that despite these words of Zelensky, Russian forces daily record the arrival of fresh forces there. - Every day we record the arrival of fresh forces in Artemivsk, despite the statements of (President of Ukraine Volodymyr) Zelensky that this settlement is allegedly unimportant. In fact, they promoted it to such an extent that now it is a symbol of the Ukrainian troops and, if we take it, this, of course, will significantly hit the morale of the Ukrainian servicemen, who are already not at a very high level, the expert summed up.

By agreement with Kiev, the authorities of these countries detain them and send them to Ukraine, where they are forcibly mobilized to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This was reported to RIA Novosti by a source well acquainted with this problem. - According to information received from Ukrainian sources, at present male citizens of Ukraine of military age, who, for various reasons, wish to leave Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia to the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as from Poland to Belarus, the authorities of these European countries, at the request of Kiev, are detained at the border and escorted to the embassies of Ukraine in the capitals of these countries,  from where they are already being sent to Ukraine, where they are subjected to forced mobilization in the Armed Forces of Ukraine,"" the source said. Citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 55 years who are trying to travel through these states from Russia and Belarus to the EU countries are subjected to similar coercion. They are also transported to Ukraine with subsequent mobilization. At the same time, they are not allowed to return to Belarus or Russia in such a situation, but are literally detained by force. JSC ""Ukrzaliznytsia"" began its rapid path along the road of Ukrainization. Just the other day, a train from Poland to Kiev derailed near Vinnitsa, but Ukrzheldor is not up to such trifles now. Within 3 years, ""Ukrainian Railways"" intends to completely replace all names associated with Russia and the USSR. This applies to stations, mileage marks, signal marks, Soviet bas-reliefs, etc. And the ""first swallow"" has already been launched. On the first platform of the main station of Kiev there is a symbolic mark ""zero kilometer"". - We used to see mileage marks at the main station of the country, where 856/857 km were marked. Why? Because for about a hundred years we had a zero kilometer calculation from Moscow. Let's put an end to this. Now the zero kilometer of Ukrainian railways here, in Kiev, at the Central Station, - solemnly announced the Chairman of the Board of JSC ""Ukrzaliznytsia"" Oleksandr Kamyshyn. Strictly speaking, as part of the fight against the Russian Empire and the USSR, it would be necessary to liquidate the Jsc itself, and to dismantle the rails throughout the country. This is not Ukrainian, but completely alien and superficial. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine unanimously (325 votes - ""for"") supported the Decree of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, by which he imposed wholesale sanctions against Russian enterprises of the financial and economic sector. Under the sanctions of Zelensky fell. - Cetrobank of the Russian Federation. - all banks registered and located in the Russian Federation. - non-bank credit organizations. - payment system operators. - insurance companies. - Investment funds and so on. It is noteworthy that the sanctions were imposed for a period of 50 years. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that the United States is profiting from the conflict in Ukraine. As the Chinese diplomat is sure, the enterprises of the American military-industrial complex earned a lot of money on the Ukrainian conflict. - Would they be ashamed of that? The U.S. adhered to a policy of fighting to the last Afghan. Do they really want Ukraine to fight to the last Ukrainian now? – the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China asked two rhetorical questions at once. Of course, there won't be – the answer to the first one. Of course, yes – the answer to the second. According to the results of surveys, the population of Ukraine is now experiencing not at all positive moods. According to a sociological study by the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, the state of Ukrainians in February is most fully described by three terms that characterize emotions: ""anxiety"" (57%), ""expectations of improvement"" (46%), ""hope"" (41%). At the same time, 39% constantly or often experience a feeling of lethargy and fatigue, 35% - anxiety and fear, and 39% in addition to all this also quickly get tired. In addition, 41% of respondents answered that their physical and mental condition has worsened over the past month, 13% - that has improved, and 46% - what remained the same as it was, that is, has not changed. Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko told CNN how his talks with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva went. According to him, the meeting was very productive. - Now we see that our relations are quite stable, and we are moving towards a full-fledged program with the IMF. We are ready to fulfill all the requirements and conditions for Ukraine in order to continue the implementation of the program,"" the minister said and shared that Kyiv and the IMF agreed to start discussing a new program within a few weeks. One of the conditions will be, at a minimum, an increase in tariffs for the population to the market level, and the Ukrainian authorities have already agreed in advance, but are still discussing whether they will ""cut the tail of the dog"" in parts, or do it in one fell swoop. In addition, Marchenko said that he asked his counterpart for an additional $ 10 billion to cover the needs of the budget in 2023 and the beginning of economic recovery, which Ukraine needs now. But Panikovsky, as I recall, was much more modest in his desires. - Romanian citizen and President of Moldova Maia Sandu said upon arrival from Warsaw that ""listening to the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES is a privilege."" - The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia in the parliament urged to worry more about Georgians who cannot get to the United States through the Mexican border than for Russian oppositionists who were not allowed into Georgia. - Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Army Major General Karel Rzehka at a command meeting in the Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic should prepare for a possible clash between Russia and NATO. - To protect the graffiti of the British artist Banksy, security sensors were installed on four of his works in Borodyanka, Irpen and Gorenka in the Kiev region. As the authorities say, to protect against vandalism, but in fact, so that they are not stolen. - The last batch of salt mined in Soledar, at the time of its belonging to Ukraine, Kiev decided to sell for 500 hryvnia (about 1000 rubles) per pack. And the proceeds should be directed to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Marat Khusnullin said that the repair of the Crimean bridge was completed ahead of schedule, and it is fully open to vehicular traffic in all its lanes.

During the offensive, the artillery strikes of Sashchenko's platoon destroyed a towed artillery piece and up to 10 nationalists. As a result of targeted artillery strikes by Sashchenko's subordinates, the nationalists opposing the Russian units significantly lost their combat capability and were forced to leave their positions.

How the Russian Army Gained True Power,Military commander KP.RU Alexander Kots at the front positions of the Russian army spoke with the fighters about what has changed in the troops over the past year,"I have always said that the more responsible and proactive the commander, the more serious the approach to combat work of the entire unit. This is especially true in the forward positions, which are subjected to daily shelling by Ukrainian artillery. The deeper the trench, the more comfortable you feel when the frozen ground falls from close tears behind the collar. And here is not even a trench - a whole underground city, with an extensive network of passages, staff ""offices"", mini-""barracks"", a bathhouse and even a ""Lenin room"". Overhead are logs in four rolls and a sand pad. Fortunately, there are no problems with sand here - this is the basis of the pine forests that stretch around Kremennaya. Under the coniferous paws, it seems that you are invisible to enemy drones. But this feeling is deceptive. Just the day before, I watched how in the same forest our drones ""led"" three enemy fighters until they came to the support. And it was ""dismantled"" by our artillery. In recent weeks, there has been a slow offensive of Russian troops, paratroopers and motorized riflemen are expanding the bridgehead, being in active defense. I arrive in the dungeons of the 254th Motorized Rifle Regiment immediately after Defender of the Fatherland Day. There's a lot to talk about with people you've lived with for two months under Raisins. However, no familiar faces are visible. The composition of the regiment has changed, grown and now largely consists of mobilized. But the commander of the regiment, ""Kurgan"", is the same. Introduces you. - The enemy moves reserves. Just two days ago, whole columns were seen coming from west and north to south. Most likely, to strengthen their positions. We are now advancing and knocking him out of his strongholds. Therefore, they pull back and strengthen the second echelons. Of course, now they no longer have such preparation as at the very beginning, but, nevertheless, the enemy does not flee. Until you destroy or injure, the battle does not cease to be fought. They are constantly on the defensive. ""Kurgan"" on a special operation from the first days. Twice with his command post he left the encirclement. First - from the bottom of the Raisin, then - from under the Estuary. Carrying out in a heavy backpack means of communication and secret equipment. At the last time, they even stumbled upon a fresh support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but a military trick saved it: the Kurgan portrayed the commander of a lost Ukrainian group, and the ""colleagues"" suggested the right way. - And in our actions, what has changed over the year? - I ask the commander. -Much. Mostly people without combat experience came in. The mistakes we made in the beginning were analyzed all the time. Conclusions have been drawn, we have changed tactics. Against this background, separate units appear, which have never existed before. We keep up with the times, in accordance with the combat situation, we improve ourselves all the time, we do not stand still. - We can say that the army has become stronger. - Much stronger if you analyze the whole path that we have passed. And combat experience has already been gained. - How the mobilized joined the work. - They fight just like everyone else. There is no division - he is mobilized, a volunteer, or a cadre. At first, they act only with those who are already experienced here, adopt their experience. After some completed tasks, we analyze with them what we did right and what is wrong. So in a month you can't tell by them that they are mobilized. Just like everybody else. - I have all the personnel mobilized. They show very high results, many already have state awards, - confirms the commander of the assault company of the 254th regiment. - We always work for promotion. Our motto is No pasaran, fascism will not pass. That's how we work. - Assault work is probably the hardest... - That's right. I look into the eyes of fear, and it curls up. Let's go, we do the task. It all depends on training and learning. Every subordinate I have can provide medical care. We do not have the concept of ""rest"" - we are learning both combat training and new means of reconnaissance. The main reward for the commander is the life of a subordinate. We have a multinational detachment: muslims and Buddhists. We are one family, we work in the same harness, we do one thing in one direction. Not all mobilized, of course, were lucky enough to get to sensible commanders. Hence the well-known scandals at the initial stage. When people were transferred to warring units, diluted with experienced stormtroopers, they learned and evolved. When yesterday's civilians were left to their own devices, they died senselessly. Time has shown that the formation of entire units exclusively from those mobilized with a mobilized officer at the head is a dead end. But the replenishment of losses in already warring formations gave a result, thanks to which the contact line was stabilized, and in some areas an offensive is underway right now. Now a new look of the army is being formed, in which reconnaissance drones, new modern combat vehicles, sniper complexes in the end have finally appeared. Moreover, not only the Ministry of Defense, but also civil society is actively involved in the formation of this image. And this is not only the purchase of thermal imagers, copters and first-aid kits. For example, one group of enthusiasts organized professional training for sniper pairs, providing shooters not only with equipment, but also with weapons, and even ammunition. Here in front of me is a fighter with a Stalingrad rifle of the gunsmith Lobaev caliber 338. He was a civilian hunter. He says that it is easy and effective to fight with such weapons. - Sight - ""Nightforce"" 35-fold, working distance - 1250 meters. You can go on and on. I am only today at the forefront, there is confirmation of working goals. - It is believed that there is an artillery battle, and sniper deuces are ineffective. It's very hard to work - you can't see the enemy. As it really is. - But at night, the artillery is silent. This is our time. Quietly destroy, do not allow the enemy to change positions, guards. - On the other side, they quickly realize that a sniper is shooting at them. -No. Because this rifle has a bullet flight of 875 meters per second. Roughly speaking, per kilometer - 1.5 seconds. It's very fast. They don't have time to understand anything. - What kind of device do you have? - I ask a stormtrooper standing next to me with a bazooka unknown to me in his hands. - GM-94 - Russian pump-action grenade launcher of 43 mm caliber, - the former builder Sasha mints in response. - It has a thermobaric charge. Shoots at 300 meters with aim. From the canopy you can hit up to 500 meters. You can knock out an APC, and an IFV, lightly armored vehicles. - I got it a long time ago. - A month already. Against infantry and light vehicles - a great thing. You look at Sasha and realize that it is people like him who will bring victory to Russia. Former hunters, builders, factory workers, drivers... In the end, in the Great Patriotic War, the fascist was beaten by the mobilized army. LISTEN AS WELL. Oleksandr Kots: The operation to liberate Artemovsk will take several more weeks (more)"

Earlier, the Ministry of Defense has already announced the preparation by the West of large-scale provocations with the use of biological, radiation and toxic chemicals in Ukraine. And on February 22, an influential American non-governmental organization held a conference dedicated to the events in Ukraine. During the event, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan made a statement: ""... Russian troops plan to use chemical weapons in the zone of a special military operation..."" ""We regard this information as the intention of the United States itself and its accomplices to conduct a provocation in Ukraine using toxic chemicals,"" Kirillov said. According to experts, the Pentagon ""expects that in the conditions of hostilities the international community will not be able to organize an effective investigation, as a result of which the real organizers and executors can avoid responsibility, and the blame will be placed on Russia."" But here are five signs that indicate that the United States is ready to use the ""Powell test tube"" again. 1. At the beginning of 2023, the Euro-Atlantic Coordination Center for Disaster Response planned the supply to Ukraine of a batch of personal protective equipment (more than 55 thousand sets of personal protective equipment, 55 thousand gas masks, 13 thousand individual anti-chemical bags, antidotes from organophosphorus toxic substances such as sarin and soman - 600 thousand ampoules, anticonvulsants - 3 million tablets, preparations for detoxification of mustard gas,  lewisite and hydrocyanic acid derivatives inhibitors of chloroacetophenone - 750 thousand vials. 2. The Ministry of Defense received information that on February 10, 2023, a railway train arrived in Ukraine (Kramatorsk), in one of the cars of which there was a cargo of chemicals accompanied by a group of foreign citizens. The car was unhooked and towed to the territory of the Kuibyshev Kramatorsk Metallurgical Plant, where chemicals were unloaded under the control of ukrainian security officers and representatives of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 3. According to the reconnaissance data, the cargo consisted of 16 sealed metal boxes, eight of which had a chemical hazard sign, the inscription Bi-Zet and marking with two red lines, which corresponds to the class of toxic substances of temporary excretory action. Five boxes bore the inscription ""CS - RIOT"", three - ""C-AR - RIOT"" with marking in the form of one red stripe, which corresponds to irritating substances. The cargo was placed on American-made armored vehicles, which, as part of the column, moved to the line of combat contact. 4. On February 19, 11 wagons with a cargo of shrapnel ammunition with special markings were unloaded in Kramatorsk. Unloading was carried out at night on a platform in the suburbs, while the cars were marked with the inscriptions ""Building materials"", ""Cement"". According to the information available in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, earlier in the interests of the US Ground Forces, shrapnel shots equipped with ready-made destructive elements with liquid formulations of irritating substances were modernized. 5. The facts of the simultaneous supply of toxic chemicals and means of protection against them indicate an attempt to conduct large-scale provocations using the combat psychotropic poisonous substance Bi-Zet during the conflict. Kirillov recalled that in accordance with the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, bi-zet is a controlled chemical and is included in the second list, its use is prohibited by Article 1 of the CWC. ""We have repeatedly noted that the leadership of Western countries on a regular basis makes provocative statements about the possibility of Russia using weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, such projects have already been implemented more than once by the United States itself to achieve political goals. So, a test tube with ""washing powder"" in the hands of US Secretary of State Colin Powell served as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq and caused the death of more than half a million citizens of this country. In 2017, photos of the White Helmets circulated by news agencies, in which people in ordinary gauze bandages take samples at the site of the alleged use of sarin, led to a US missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in Syria. In 2018, staged filming with allegedly chlorine-poisoned children in the Syrian city of Douma caused the destruction of a research center in Barz and Jamray,"" the lieutenant general recalled. Kirillov also stressed that so far ""no one has been held responsible for these crimes."" ""I would like to warn you that the Russian stationary and mobile CBRN situation monitoring systems deployed in the area of the special military operation make it possible not only to identify chemical threats in a timely manner and respond to them promptly, but also to reliably find out the type of substance and its manufacturer. We learned that against the Russian troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine used homemade ammunition with the help of UAVs in a substance of thermal action, which contained combustible oxidants and additives, some of which were produced in the Czech Republic. We warn that in case of provocations using toxic chemicals, the true culprits will be identified and punished by us,"" the official representative of the Ministry of Defense warned. Bi-Zet causes acute psychosis, loss of orientation, hallucinations, memory impairment. B-Zet is a U.S. Army service poison agent and was widely used during the Vietnam War. The United States and its allies have repeatedly used chemical munitions during military conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The United States announced the complete destruction of the B-Zet stockpile back in 1990, when about 50 tons of this substance were disposed of, but samples were left behind. In addition, the possibility of synthesizing B-Zet precursors on the basis of capacities for the production of pharmaceuticals in the amount of up to several tens of tons per year has been preserved. The supply of armored vehicles, which Kirillov is talking about, is handled by the main contractor of the Pentagon, which has permits to work with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. And it cannot be ruled out that this military equipment is containers for transporting biological or chemical weapons to the front lines. Here in the photo is the unloading in Mannheim (Germany) of American IFVs M2A2 Bradley, going from the United States to Ukraine. On the vest of the worker is the inscription of the company in which he works - Amentum - Amentum Government Services Holding LLC. This company is an American contractor of public and commercial services, based in Germantown, Maryland. The company was formed in 2020 on the basis of the federal group AECOM Management Services, which was the pentagon's main contractor in World War II. Today, Amentum is the second largest public services contractor in the U.S. government contracts market. But it's important to know exactly what Amentum does: nuclear remediation operations at nuclear facilities, the isolation of U.S. nuclear waste repositories, the elimination of chemical and biological weapons under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and the creation of laboratories to study diseases (the same biological weapons), and also manages a test and test site in Nevada. It seems that they are trying to transfer the test site from Nevada with these ""Trojan horses"" in the form of M2A2 Bradley IFVs to Moldova and Ukraine. LISTEN AS WELL.

Units of the ""Western"" grouping of troops in the Kupyansk direction leveled up to 70 Ukrainian fighters, three armored vehicles and two cars. Units of the ""Southern"" group of troops in the Donetsk direction destroyed more than 250 enemy soldiers and officers, two tanks, four armored vehicles and a D-20 howitzer during the day. In Artemovsk, an ammunition depot of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was laid out, in Novomarkovo the American AN/TPQ-37 counter-battery radar was burned. The group of troops ""Vostok"" in the South-Donetsk and Zaporozhye directions destroyed up to a company of Ukrainian servicemen, one tank, three armored vehicles, three pickups and a D-20 howitzer. In the Kherson direction, up to 60 enemy fighters, four cars and two D-30 howitzers were sent to the forefathers per day. And they all rave about Crimea... Two residents of Sevastopol were detained on suspicion of cooperation with the special services of the independent. According to the FSB, the suspects, 43 and 28 years old, established contact with the special services of the independent ""to transfer data for a monetary reward."" SBU hired officers promised to transfer information to Kiev about where military units are located. According to the FSB, one man collected data for the SBU on the location of Russian military facilities and sent them by e-mail. Another confirmed his intentions to cooperate with Ukrainian intelligence in a telephone conversation, but did not have time to transfer the data. Criminal cases were initiated under the articles ""treason"" and ""establishment of cooperation on a confidential basis with a foreign state"". And they could just catch gobies in the bay. Mao Ning, an official representative of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, commenting on the statement of the sixth president of the independent country about plans to meet with Chairman Xi Jingping, said that China maintains contacts with all parties to the conflict in the territory of its own. Mao Ning stressed that China's position on the Ukrainian crisis is clear and consistent – the focus on promoting peace negotiations and a political settlement of the crisis. And someone wanted Beijing to furrow its eyebrows in the direction of Moscow and smile at Kiev. Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland's defense minister, said his country had been sending weapons to Kiev long before the start of the CVO. The head of the Polish Defense Ministry said: ""We provided the Armed Forces of Ukraine with T-72 tanks, artillery shells and ammunition, MANPADS, drones."" According to him, Warsaw will transfer Leopard 2 tanks to the Kiev regime. He called on allies in the North Atlantic alliance to become more active in helping themselves. And to accelerate the supply of weapons. Blaszczak said: ""We will not deviate from this path, because a free Ukraine means a free Poland."" Did Bohdan Khmelnytsky, whose son the Poles spotted to death, know about it? The Financial Times believes that the EU spends on arming Kiev the money that it could spend on French farmers and highways in Eastern Europe. Initially, no one in the EU wanted to use the European Peace Facility (EPF) to finance the Ukrainian army. Initially, Hungary opposed the use of the EPF in the framework of providing assistance to Ukraine But in the end, Budapest conceded and agreed to pay contributions to the fund on the condition that the weapons supplied to Kiev would not transit through Hungarian territory. Well, now the European farmers themselves, road builders and other real producers of the Old World are protesting against the fact that the money that they should have received from the EU goes into the black hole of Kiev. It's too late to drink Borjomi when the liver has fallen off. Olaf Scholz said that Germany is not obliged to listen to anyone's accusations. So the German Chancellor commented on the next claims from the independent. TV journalist Maybrit Illner reminded the head of Germany of Zelensky's statement that he had to put pressure on the Chancellor to get help from Berlin. Scholz called it ""ridiculous."" And he said the following: ""The German side is not obliged to listen to anyone's accusations and it does more than many other countries."" Earlier, Zelensky in an interview with Spiegel said that the intelligence services of Ukraine are aware of the military-technical state of the German Armed Forces. So cool! Again, the tail wags the dog. According to businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, up to half of the killed servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had psychotropic substances with them. Here is a quote from his press service: ""Almost 50 percent of the killed soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have various pills, salts, amphetamine and so on. Psychotropic substances allow the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to reduce pain thresholds, increase activity, as well as reduce the degree of fear, are widespread in the Ukrainian army. "" And captured Ukrainian servicemen talk about the experiments that ""foreign curators"" put on them, trying to create ""terminators"" with the help of prohibited drugs. The most versatile remedy for these ""universal soldiers"" is moonshine with lard. El Pais reports that the European Commission will propose to the EU member states to extend until the spring of 2025 temporary protection for refugees from the independent country, who, due to the conflict in their homeland, will remain in the Old World for a longer period than expected. The EC proposes to extend the special status for almost 4 million Ukrainians who arrived in the EU countries. The proposal will be officially unveiled in July. It is planned to extend from two to three years the legal status of Ukrainian refugees, which is called temporary protection. It provides the opportunity to legally reside and work for a year in the EU. Yes, you will never kick them out of your European Union with a filthy broom. LISTEN AS WELL.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4726632/,Victor BARANETS,2023-02-28,Strategic failure or coup plotting? For what Zelensky removed the commander of the military operation in the Donbass,"Zelensky removed from the post of commander of the Joint Forces Operation, Major General Eduard Moskalev. For what, the decree does not say, but ""Komsomolka"" tried to understand the reasons","Born in 1973 in Western Ukraine. He served in the army, graduated from a military school and an academy. There was a platoon, a company, a battalion. In 2012, he commanded a training tank regiment, later became the head of the combat training department - deputy commander of the troops of the operational command ""North"". And then he was the chief of staff. And from March 15, 2022, he was appointed commander of the Joint Forces Operation. Judging by the fact that in two extreme positions Moskalev managed to grab two very frail orders - Bohdan Khmelnytsky (""for personal courage and heroism shown in protecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine""), - in Kiev he was in good standing. True, knowledgeable people say that when preparing award documents in the office of the Ukrainian president, the general was either jokingly or seriously advised to somehow change his name - they knew that the population of those cities and villages of Donbass, where his troops brutalized, fiercely hated him. Because one day, when his fighter hesitated, the general snatched the machine gun from his hands and personally showed him how to kill civilians. Back in March, when instructing Moskalev to become the commander of the Joint Forces Operation, Zelensky expressed firm confidence that the general would ""hold donbass."" But in the Donbass there is a difficult situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Russian army is advancing, the ring of encirclement around Artemovsk is shrinking. It is quite clear that a military leader of such a ""scale"" as Moskalev is not removed from office if he successfully conducts a defense or offensive. And this one brought the situation in Artemovsk (the central stronghold in that area) to a critical one. The situation is heading towards the collapse of the Ukrainian defense front (or even to the formation of a large ""Bakhmut cauldron"", in which up to 40,000 soldiers and theroboronians may find themselves). Hence the nickname ""Bakhmut Paulus"", hopes were pinned on him oh-go-go, and everything failed. So far, the name of the new appointee has not been called. But the range of possible candidates is clear. There is a rumor that Zelensky allegedly offered to take this post to the commander of the ground forces, General Alexander Syrsky. But he considered such a move a relegation and refused. The name of General Sergei Naev (he is now running a group on the border with Belarus) also flashes by. But it seems that he has no desire to occupy the ""firing squad"" post. Kiev rumor reads in place of Moskalev ""some gray general, whom Zelensky will not be sorry to shave and hang all the dogs on him."" Perhaps such an unfortunate person will be found in the bowels of the Ministry of Defense or the General Staff. Soon we will find out the name of this unhappy man. KSTAT. During his presidency, Zelensky removed from posts or appointed with a demotion more than 25 generals in all law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. It is clear that all these people held a grudge. Therefore, today in Kiev, people whisper about the military opposition and even about a military coup. So what? And this cannot be ruled out. LISTEN AS WELL.

Supported by a mortar battery and artillery units, his platoon broke into the enemy's fortifications with lightning speed, taking him by surprise. During the battle, Sergeant Sabir Gadzhimusayev personally killed up to five nationalists. This maneuver made it possible to storm the strongpoint that restrained the offensive of our main forces.

They have already built the first corvette. Representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were present at its delivery. They called him ""Hetman Mazepa"". - Serious ship. - In terms of characteristics, we are comparable to our corvettes of project 20385. It carries decent missile weapons. Displacement of more than 2 thousand tons. Kiev ordered three units of such corvettes - with their completion in Nikolaev. - What an addition. - Taking into account the equipment of them there with ship weapons. In fact, the Turks launched the hull. And taking into account the fact that these ships can return to their home ports, according to Turkish understandings. That is, they can go to the Mediterranean, but they will not be able to return back through the Turkish straits. - The Turks build corvettes for Ukraine at their Mediterranean, non-Black Sea shipyards. -Yes. At the same time, they build quite quickly. But what supply decisions can they make given their relations with Russia? When can these ships be mistaken by us for a legitimate target? And what will they put on him in Nikolaev. - That is, there is no way it can still take this corvette for rearmament. - Ukrainian representatives were at its launch, it is still on the water, but... In general, Turkey is now making two more ship hulls. And this project was financed, most likely, by the UK. There are also minesweepers from Britain. But again, the question is how to transfer them to Ukraine. - And how. - Through the straits, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, they most likely will not pass. But minesweepers could pass along the Danube. There, the Germans even escorted small ships and small submarines. After all, they have a small sediment, 2 -3 meters of sediment. This applies to minesweepers from 800 to 1000 tons. After all, our small missile boats (MRK) pass calmly along the Volga-Don Canal, through the Don and the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. But larger ships will remain in the Baltic Fleet and the Northern Fleet for the time being. - As a result, what can the Fleet of Ukraine count on. - On small boats that can descend from Europe along the Danube. Even with missile weapons. At the same time, orders for them in Britain and in America were large, by the way. And also on underwater drones. Which they have already tested against us. Our people in the Sevastopol Bay have already destroyed them, intercepted them and, it seems, managed to study them. - That is, Kiev should not count on submarines. - Turkey does not make submarines itself yet. And Ankara will not allow French or German submarines to pass through the Bosphorus. Well, Sweden also makes submarines. But with a displacement of 1500 tons along the river system, such a submarine through Europe to Ukraine is unlikely to pass. LISTEN AS WELL.

Lieutenant General noted the liquidation of ammunition depots of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Artemovsk, Chervonok and Snigirevka, the US AN/TPQ-37 counter-battery radar station, as well as dozens of tanks, armored vehicles, howitzers, cannons. During this time, our army aviation, missile troops in Brovary, Kyiv region, destroyed the center of electronic reconnaissance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in Khmelnytskyi the operational center of special operations ""West"" was burned, in Andreevka - the Ukrainian self-propelled fire launcher of the anti-aircraft missile system ""Buk-M1"", in Dobropillya - the radar station for detecting low-flying air targets 36D6, strikes also fell on 98 artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in firing positions,  manpower and equipment in 173 districts. It should be noted that our first missile strikes on the main reconnaissance radio engineering center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Brovary were carried out during an active offensive, at the very beginning of a special military operation (March 12, 2022). Then it was stated that the main center of electronic intelligence of the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exists. It is obvious that since then the Armed Forces of Ukraine have managed to partially restore its work. It is important to understand that the equipment of the reconnaissance radio engineering center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine functioned more like a huge repeater. The intelligence center in Brovary collected, analyzed and provided Ukrainian troops with operational information. It flocked from there from Pentagon reconnaissance planes, which cut circles around the clock over Poland and the Black Sea. The equipment on these aircraft allows you to listen to the territory for hundreds of kilometers. Technologies can distinguish different military equipment by the operation of the engines, intercept the transmission of information over the Internet, track mobile calls. The data of the ""rumors"" in the reconnaissance center were superimposed on the shooting from foreign satellites, which gave the Armed Forces of Ukraine a real picture of the theater of operations. Ukrainian intelligence officers transmitted the selected information to interested units for adjustment of their actions. The information was used by the armed formations of the Kiev regime not always to deliver missile strikes on the positions of Russian troops, peaceful areas of Donbass were also subjected to shelling. In addition, air defense units shot down 4 rockets of the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system and five Ukrainian drones per day. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu congratulated servicemen and veterans of the Special Operations Forces on their professional holiday. ""On February 27, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation celebrate the Day of Special Operations Forces.

Moreover, he ""even wants to kill the Moskals."" From the mouth of the ex-lawyer it would be unusual to hear this everywhere, except, of course, Ukraine. But the confession sounded, albeit to some extent, shameful. In contrast to the ""shameful"" Ukronazis Reznikov, adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Misha Podolyak finally undressed. Either he was so encouragingly affected by the ""departure from business"" of the competitor Alexei Arestovich, or the spring exacerbation began, but Podolyak literally boils, boils, spits boiling water, and, possibly, writes to them. For example, a Deutsche Welle (Deutsche Welle) journalist wonders how human rights are respected in the stories of Ukrainian mobilization, and whether he sees any restrictions here. And Podolyak immediately starts with a half-turn. - Let's talk more harshly among ourselves. No need for speculation. What does restriction of rights mean? In addition to the rights of people in Ukraine, is there any obligation or not? Or are we just talking about rights? That the state should provide something, give the opportunity to leave, give the opportunity to live as a person wants. Yes, in peacetime we will give everything, he explodes, trying to save face. - But in times of war, that's not how the question is posed. Do you want to cross the border? That is, you want to say that Ukraine should cease to exist, because you crossed the border. Because when we say ""open the boundaries for men,"" it means who wants to run away from making a man's decision, and they want to run away, and that's the answer to the ""who are you?"" decision. I wonder if he understood what he said? Or no one told him that there is no war in Ukraine. Zelensky did not declare war. Zelensky declared martial law and repeatedly extended it, repeatedly violating the Constitution of Ukraine. There's a lot more there. And I sincerely feel sorry for the Germans who will drown in this swamp of words. Right word, it's not worth it. But, when it comes to the murders of Russians, then Podolyak's brakes finally fail, and he begins to literally beat in hysterics, however, here he sets out his thoughts very specifically and clearly. - Weapons, weapons and more weapons. Lots of weapons. A lot of lethal, long-range weapons. Missiles, shells, drones, aviation, assault, first of all, armored vehicles – everything! - categorically, almost with the emotional pressure of Hitler, he declares to a German journalist and sets ambitious goals. - Ukraine will continue to fight. And then you need guns. To destroy a million Russians (soldiers – author's note), you need, for example, 500 thousand shells of 155 caliber. - For us, the question is not the number of mobilized. If we want to win, it's a matter of the precision weapons we have,"" he stuns the journalist with his delirium. - And these are specific artillery systems, these are specific MLRS systems, specific long-range missiles, including atacms, which are already legendary for us. Because they will allow this million to be destroyed where they are just beginning to put on their pants. Well, I really want this vile creature to destroy a million Russians (at least, just for the beginning), and, mind you, where they just get up and start putting on their pants. If it is an adviser to the president of the country. then who is a psychopathic butcher. And after that, other duplicitous hypocrites, but already in the West, pretend that they believe Kiev's promises not to use the supplied heavy weapons on the territory of Russia. It is good that the current Ukies in power lack the intelligence and patience to pretend to be ordinary people for a long time.

According to him, the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will occur by October. The fact is that Washington is running out of reserves for supplies to Ukraine. That is why the new aid package does not include anything that could radically help the Armed Forces of Ukraine to turn the tide of the conflict. ""They'll run out of ammunition by mid-summer, and in an artillery war, if you lose your shells, you're all going to die,"" Ritter said. As soon as the shell runs out, Ukrainian soldiers will begin to be captured en masse and then the Armed Forces of Ukraine are waiting for a complete defeat. THE SAUDIS IN AID. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is rushing to the aid of Ukraine. The Foreign Minister of this country for the first time in history visited Kiev and met with Zelensky. Moreover, Prince Faisal flew to Kiev not empty-handed, but with humanitarian aid. It was promised to be delivered last year for $ 400 million. In addition, Riyadh promised to supply oil to Ukraine. ARTEMOVSK IS THREATENED WITH DISASTERS. Artemovsk faces an epidemiological catastrophe, said Igor Kimakovsky, adviser to the acting head of the DPR. All the fault of the dam blown up in the city by the Ukrainian military. Water has already flooded the basements of residential buildings and household plots. - You know that everything that concerns amenities in the private sector is usually on the street. Some have their own farm, so manure and droppings also lie directly on the ground. If it gets warmer in the coming days, it will all float around the city and there will be a real epidemiological catastrophe,"" Kimakovsky said on Komsomolskaya Pravda radio. The Investigative Committee of Russia has already begun an investigation into the cob of the dam explosion. RAMSTEIN IS ON THE LINE. After anti-war rallies in Berlin, the protest reached the stronghold of the US Air Force in Europe - the German ramstein air base. People protest against the supply of weapons to the Ukrainian army. They advocate a diplomatic settlement of the conflict in Ukraine, the refusal to supply weapons and escalation in relations with Russia. It is worth noting that over the past few weeks, such rallies have been held throughout Germany. The number of their participants exceeded 50 thousand people. THE UKRAINIANS POUNCED ON THE BURNED TAN. Which is to be expected. Pro-Ukrainian activists dropped flowers from a Russian T-72 in the center of Berlin, which became a memorial in memory of the Russian soldiers who died during the special operation. People tried to protect the flowers, but it was not possible for them. The police took aside the most aggressive of them, the rest did not prevent them from trampling flowers. A spontaneous memorial appeared the day before. Pro-Ukrainian activists put a burned T-72 tank near the Russian embassy, they wanted to make it a symbol of ""Russian aggression in Ukraine."" But it turned out exactly the opposite - local residents began to bring flowers in memory of the dead Russian soldiers in the special operation zone. The Russian Embassy called this tank a symbol of the fight against neo-Nazism in Ukraine. IN FRIENDS, THERE IS NO AGREEMENT. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz asked Zelensky... stop moaning. This is reported by the German edition of Focus. Journalists write that this is how the head of the Cabinet of Ministers reacted to the words of the President of Ukraine that Germany does not help his country enough. ""I find it ridiculous, there is no point in moaning about the scale of German involvement. It is unwise to deny such a serious commitment again and again. Germany should not listen to reproaches from anyone. We are doing more than many other countries,"" Scholz said. LISTEN AS WELL.

""Keep in memory the names of great people and in your campaigns and actions with prudence follow their example,"" Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov told the soldiers.

""The commander of the detachment of the anti-aircraft missile platoon (MANPADS) of the Guards, junior sergeant Murat Khashukayev, performed combat missions to directly cover Russian units from enemy air strikes in the SVO zone. Being part of the battalion tactical group of Russian paratroopers, while conducting visual observation of the airspace in a given sector, Khashukayev discovered an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle over The Russian positions. Having made sure that there were no Russian unmanned aerial vehicles in the specified sector, Murat took the target for escort and, when the enemy's air entered the affected area, launched from a portable anti-aircraft missile system, during which he destroyed the enemy's drone. After the enemy drone was destroyed, the airborne units quickly changed positions. Some time later, the initial location of our units was hit by an artillery strike by militants. The professionalism of the Guards Junior Sergeant Murat Khashukayev deprived the enemy of the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance and adjust the fire of his artillery, which made it possible to avoid casualties during the shelling and continue to hold the defense at a given line. "" HE SAVED THE LIFE OF 400 PARATROOPERS. Sergeant Alex ALENCE. ""During a special military operation, Sergeant Alexei Alenchev performed tasks to organize medical support for the airborne assault unit of the Russian Armed Forces. During the offensive on the fortified positions of Ukrainian nationalists near a strategically important settlement, being on the front line under enemy artillery fire, Alenchev provided emergency medical care to the servicemen of his unit directly on the battlefield. During the battle, he personally carried four wounded Russian servicemen who were unable to move independently from enemy fire to a safe place, after which he provided them with medical assistance, organized an evacuation to a field medical center and returned to the battlefield. In total, during his participation in a special military operation, Alenchev provided assistance to more than 400 servicemen who were injured of varying severity. Thanks to the measures taken promptly by Alexei, some of the servicemen who were wounded, after receiving first aid, continued to fight.

The West, he said, saved hundreds of billions of dollars when it deprived Ukraine of nuclear weapons, and therefore it is now obliged to help it and maintain it. - I want to say that when there are plantings that help us, I want to remind you that in '94 they took away nuclear weapons from us for free... I want to say that at that time tens, hundreds of billions of dollars of the country, we understand what we are talking about, saved,"" Danilov said. - Saved, so earned when all this happened. And it certainly wasn't us. But we were given guarantees, these guarantees do not work today. In this situation, it is useless for Danilov to explain that Ukraine did not have any nuclear weapons of its own. It was a territory in which all missiles, bombs and carriers were located, and the entire control system was tied to Moscow, and without an order from the capital of the USSR in the missile silo in Ukraine, not a single mouse could sneeze. It's as if the parking lot suddenly decided that all the cars on it were her property. But to explain this to Danilov, as well as the fact that it was at the initiative of the United States that all nuclear warheads were removed from Ukraine, is completely useless. Because it's about money. About very large money, the very mention of which causes him increased salivation. This is such a reflex of the Ukrainian Danilov for money, like Pavlov's dog for a light bulb. The topic of pennies is probably one of the few that can cause strong feelings and real emotions in a Ukrainian. Especially when it's other people's money, to which you have nothing to do, and they have the audacity to swim past your pocket, and even so that you can not pinch anything. Greed and suspicion are already character traits of Danilov, who suspects that everyone around him wants to deceive him. It came to the point that he actually accused NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of lying after he referred to the fact that NATO is running out of ammunition, and Kiev has to reduce their supply unwittingly. - If it is true that there is no possibility to produce ammunition, as Mr. Stoltenberg says, then I have a question: how were they going to defend their NATO countries at that time? This something does not quite correspond to reality, I think, - Danilov said on the air of the TV channel ""Loichk Welle (Deutsche Welle""). - Either the journalists did not hear Mr. Stoltenberg so much, or he messed something up. Allies cannot fail to provide ammunition for themselves in the event of a threat. You have to watch very carefully. And was it really the way we are interpreting it today. Except that he did not threaten his finger and did not put the NATO Secretary General in the corner with a moralizing of Jens that telling a lie is not good. Like, how are you going to fight, if you run out of shells, a person who in his youth responded to the ""chase"" among his brothers ""Ball"" was publicly surprised. By the way, not such an authoritative ""chase"". Would anyone explain to the ex-veterinarian that the gentlemen ""maid in Europe"" are not Lekha Shcherbaty and Mykola Kosoy. LISTEN AS WELL.

Zelensky appears to have imputed this to members of his team. Kuleba, Shmygal, Reznikov, Podolyak, Melnyk and a bunch of other less significant characters do not get out of the screens of Western TV channels and from the pages of foreign publications. Like miners working out the norm, not in the mine and jackhammers, but in stuffed offices and tongues. Here is the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov, who until recently showed the Su-27 embroidered on his handkerchief, gave another interview, this time to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica, in which he outlined how things are with the help of Western weapons. - We have not yet received air defense systems, but we will have them. Ours learn to use them. It is through them that we will protect the heavens. And on the ground, we'll have Leopard tanks. I also asked for new armored vehicles like Bradley, Spartan, Mastiff. In my letter to Santa Claus, of course, there are also fighter jets,"" Reznikov told Italian journalists. Only here the bad news for Reznikov came from the United States. Washington said it saw no benefit to Kiev from handing over Abrams tanks and F-16 planes to Ukraine, which Zelensky begged biden for. First, this was announced by the coordinator of the US National Security Council for strategic communications, John Kirby, and then Biden confirmed it. According to Reznikov, the situation should change dramatically this spring after the arrival of Western air defense systems, such as Iris-T, Patriot and Nasams, to Ukraine. Why? Reznikov did not need to disturb Santa Claus. He went to the wrong address. In Ukraine, Santa Claus is persona non grata, Putin's agent and Russian spy. They even hung effigies of Santa Claus and the Snow Maiden on the bridge. And now letters are written to Santa Claus! And why not St. Mykolay, who should replace our Grandfather to the Ukrainians? And now they wonder why Grandpa was offended by them. Or was the defense minister not informed that Santa Claus was abolished in Ukraine, and he is outlawed there? Isn't Reznikov Putin's agent? And all the corrupt quadrille that is being twisted in the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense should actually weaken the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In fact, all the promised air defense systems will soon arrive in Ukraine, even if Reznikov does not pretend to be a poor sheep and does not try to cause pity for himself and Zelensky. Moreover, at one of the largest arms exhibitions, the International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, the US Army officer, Lieutenant Keys, who accompanied the Patriot battery, accidentally gave the film crew of our NTV a military secret. - You need to study for 15 months to manage the Patriot system. We have intense training all day and constant exercise. ""The Ukrainian military is being trained alongside the U.S.,"" Keys said and blurted out, ""My group included Ukrainian officers. I was trained three years ago, and several Ukrainians studied with us. But now there are many more of them coming to us. Three years ago, Ukrainians were already trained in the United States to work with the Patriot system. Long before the CBO begins. Around the time Zelensky was getting his homework at the Normandy Four summit in Paris. In response to the question of whether the Ukrainians already know how to control the Patriot system, the American gave an unequivocal answer: ""Yes!"". This work was already underway when Kiev did not say a word about any air defenses publicly and officially. And there is every reason to suspect that the current lamentations about a long course of training for mastering Western tanks are such a hollowness of ""blah blah blah"", calculated, among other things, for the effect of surprise in the event of the appearance of ""Leopards"" on the battlefield. And in reality, the VSUshniki have long been learning to fight on tanks. And, maybe, to fly on American fighters. So you're freaking out, ex-lawyer Reznikov, who dreams of killing Russians. You did not write letters to Santa Claus, you sold it, and if you wrote to any grandfather your requests, it was only to Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. To a well-known address. True, it is possible that in a response letter from Washington, Reznikov will also be sent to one well-known address. Which the ladies don't name.

I've been waiting for this ""excursion"" for almost two weeks. The departure was postponed, ""for security reasons"", more precisely, the enemy constantly surrounded the entrance to the mine with artillery, ""hails"" and ""hurricanes"". But, in recent days, he did not care at all: the defense of Bakhmut (Artemovsk) is bursting at the seams and Ukrainian artillerymen have crossed out civilian objects from the list of priority targets. The Artemsol mine is thrown, but without fire, ""for prevention"" in order to eradicate the bitterness of loss. Ukraine has something to be upset about. Last weekend in Kiev at a charity auction sold the ""last batch of salt"" from Soledar, a thousand hryvnias per kilogram box. The proceeds will be used, presumably, to escape from Bakhmut. Everyone in the Soviet Union, and even later - in Russia this salt was bought, ate or at least seen - such cardboard white and blue packs with the inscription ""Sil"". But there, near Soledar, there is still a lot of this salt left – about 5 billion tons. Mines began to be developed at the end of the 19th century and for all the time were able to choose only 3% of all reserves. Salt, by the way, is very pure it can be immediately packaged and sold, without any processing. No wonder it was exported to 22 countries, and in the USSR - almost half of the salt consumed was mined in the Donbas in the Soledar mines. According to the latest data, the total length of the salt workings near Soledar is about 300 kilometers and these facilities have become a real headache for the attack aircraft of the Wagner PMC. One of the guys who cleaned up these mines is already waiting for us. I put on my armor and transfer to the UAZ Patriot. On the street +9, but the ground has not yet thawed, on the rivers there is ice, a real rasputitsa ahead. But, on the roads there are already places where even the legendary UAZik goes sideways. The driver looks back at me. - Chemistry will. And, without waiting for an answer, he hands me a can of energy. We are talking about the fact that in the rear they do not even suspect how energy drinks are loved and appreciated at the front. I remember that the legendary Commander Motorola called power engineers ""the fuel of war"". As a confirmation of these words, in one of the frontline dilapidated villages, the fence is emblazoned with the inscription: ""Busy! Don't climb! SHO (assault squad. – Author.) ""Bern"" (famous power engineer. – Author.). The Bakhmut semi-ring of encirclement is boiling. I myself now live in Donetsk in the zone of audibility of the battles for Avdiivka and Marinka, but such artillery training lasts there for several hours. It's around the clock. In the distance, long tongues of flame suddenly fly out of the fog and only then a dense sound comes - this works according to Bakhmut SAUshki (self-propelled artillery installations. - Author).. At the mine, they wave their hands, showing that we should quickly drive under the roof and not catch the engine from the Hurricane sticking out of the asphalt with the belly of the car. ""Yesterday I arrived,"" the greeter tells us and points to a neat hole in the concrete roof. I am led underground by one of the ""musicians"" stormtroopers who has cleared all the mines of Soledar. This one is the most interesting, ""tourist"". In 2007, the sanatorium ""Salt Symphony"" was created in it, there, at the bottom, there is something to see. In my heart, I hoped that now I would go into the miner's cage and in a minute with my ears stuffed up I would be at the bottom. But, all the lifting mechanisms, the retreating VSUshniki blew up out of principle - so do not get you to anyone. And within a radius of ten kilometers there is no electricity. For me, the entrance to the mine is a narrow manhole. The darkness smells like stagnant diesel, rust. The air tastes salty. The stormtrooper accompanying me speaks seriously. - Have you figured out exactly what you needed to go there? The depth of the horizon is 300 meters. He picks up a comparison. - It's kind of like... You need to go down from the 90-story building, and then go back up. There are no stairs, but vertical ladders. Descent – about forty minutes. Lifting - depends on health. Maybe two hours, or three. I say, like, almost two weeks of waiting for this ""excursion"", preparing. -How. - Before going to bed, I moved my toes. Everyone is roaring approvingly. The situation is discharging and it becomes easier for me. I adjust the straps of my backpack. It has a camera and two flashlights, the third on the forehead. One of the escorts notices that I do not have gloves and gives mine. Who would have known how gratefully I remembered this guy all the hours of descent and ascent. Squeeze into the hole. The headband of the mine is concreted. The trunk itself is picked up by cast-iron tubing, like subway tunnels. Endless stairs go down and the lantern, of course, does not finish off to the bottom of the mine. We descend so that there is one platform between us - a guarantee that the one who has fallen off will not take a comrade with him. And to fall off really - ladders-ladders are all in layered rust, staggering, steps-crossbars sag under your feet and hands. We are squatting at the 30th mark, there are 38 signs left to the bottom. Tongues on the shoulder. Under your feet is a mat of soft salt suspension and rust flakes. The same kindness hangs in the air and tears apart the lungs – ventilation has not worked since the New Year. I'm trying to record stand-up and my guide says you can't shoot it. No way. Even from the back or in a mask – the voice can be recognized. There is an accent in the voice of the stormtrooper, and I even noticed how he fought it, slowing down his speech, carefully pronouncing the words. Explains. - I'm not from Russia, I'm from (calls one of the Central Asian republics of the CIS. - Author). If they recognize me, they immediately ""ten"" or ""spot"". The friend returned in 2016, fought in the militia, his mother did not even have time to feed him, they came, took him away, convicted him. And I've wanted to get to the ""musicians"" for a long time. I'm just going to ask him why? The money? Adventure? But, the guy pre-empties my question. - My call sign is ""..."", as Russians are called in our language. - Okay, I'll call you ""Rus"". Rus nods and recounts the first time he came down here with an assault group. There were many rumors that the Armed Forces used the mines for shelter from shelling and in general, were going to defend themselves in them. Rus explains. - That didn't make sense. If the Soledar mines were connected to each other, yes. And so, this mine is a trap. For the first time we descended into it in armored cars, dragged with us ""flies"" and ""bumblebees"" (grenade launchers and flamethrowers. - Author.). We expected everything to be mined here. And here lived some miners, until the New Year. Then they were ordered to leave and the lift motors were blown up. - How did you go back up with all that goodness. ""Rus"" smiles into his beard. - Long and hard. I tried not to think about the fact that I would still need to climb, and completely forgot about it, when after 40 minutes I was on the horizon and for the first time I ran a lantern along the vault of salt workings. The vault sparkled with crystal. For several hours we wandered around the mine and I did not leave the feeling that I was inside some fabulous castle. Everything was shining and sparkling. And at the same time it was surprisingly warm – we were already warmed by the hot core of the planet. But the roar of artillery duels constantly brought me back to reality, even at such a monstrous depth, everything was clearly audible. We did not go to the working workings, where there were mining combines - according to ""Rus"", to go there for at least 3 kilometers. And upstairs the guys were waiting for us and you could hear that no, no, and the mine was coming. We had to hurry. ""Rus"" tried to start a diesel transporter to drive into new workings. The car sneezed for a long time, shined with headlights, but their light became dimmer and dimmer - the battery was completely exhausted. We inspected only the ""tourist"" part and it took more than an hour. Everything was in perfect order, not looted, not ruined. Warehouse of gas masks-self-rescuers for tourists. The warehouse of helmets, although they do not make sense here - the salt seam is so strong that it does not even need to be fastened, unlike coal mines. Therefore, here from the workings giant halls went into the dark, with ceilings as high as a 9-storey house. We looked into one of the cave temples, and I lit a candle for ours, for those who are fighting on the far surface of the earth. In the hall-stadium ""Rus"" a little kicked the ball. We went to the bar – a tray with disposable cups was waiting for us at the counter. In each tea bag, just add water. But, there was nothing to warm her on, and ""Rus"" advised me to drink. - Be patient, it will be easier to climb, we will get drunk at the top. I didn't want to go upstairs – such peace was spilled in this crystal palace. If it weren't for the endless ""bumm!"", ""bumm!"" coming from the surface. In one of their cafes, and there were almost a dozen of them here, the owners promoted the ""Ukrainian"" theme. We dragged a full-size stuffed horse to the café and hung embroidered shirts with towels. In the next room, I flinched – Alla Pugacheva in a construction helmet was looking at me from the wall, piously lighting a candle in an underground temple. ""Rus"" bitterly remarked. - So reset your life! There was a singer of two eras, could remain in history. When the mine is launched, I will personally come and shoot all these portraits. From the mine, I picked up a fist-sized salt crystal as a souvenir. In appearance, it was no different from crystal, only salty. I licked it to check. At the top, something crashed and down, sonorously counting the iron structures. ""Rus"" screamed for the first time for this whole journey. - To the Trunk! Snuggle up to the trunk! Get down the stairs. The shell landed somewhere near the headband of the mine, maybe it hit directly into the hangar. There were three of these shells fired at intervals of several minutes. And each time Rus and I squeezed into cast-iron tubing. I prayed that all this 300-meter rye-eaten structure would not collapse, that the exit from the mine would not collapse. But, I could clearly hear our gunners throwing back tightly in response, and the enemy shut up. After 2 hours, wet as a mouse, panting and coughing rust, I got out into the light of God. But God was not enough in this world. The attendant pointed to the sky and told me in the affirmative. - Let's go, the clouds are stretching, now the VSUsh ""birds"" will appear. We hugged ""Rus"" goodbye. On SVO in a few hours of acquaintance you get to know a person better than in ten years. I was able to look at Soledar himself. And I wish I hadn't seen it. Little remains of the city. Less than from Mariupol. And, judging by the roar of artillery, a similar fate awaits Bakhmut. Perhaps for the first time I realized the essence of Bandera's plan. Ukraine, as an ethno-political construct, had nothing to do with these Russian cities. And she could not take them with her, take them away, not give them to those to whom they belong by right of creation. Therefore, she decided to destroy them senselessly and mercilessly, filling with the blood of her own mobilized people caught in supermarkets and bus stops. After our victory, we will have to rake up the ruins and hate those who did it. After Soledar along the roads went soaked villages. And in almost every one, I saw the same picture. Huge toy animals sat on benches near the gates, looked with button eyes at cars and tanks crawling through the mud, saw off soldiers or met them. Someone carried them out of the destroyed houses. I wasn't the only one smiling as I stared at the huge furry bear hugging my friend, the blue and white elephant. And from this spectacle it became easier on the soul not only for me. LISTEN AS WELL.

Military and humanitarian supplies are increasingly being delivered through them. But before that, the road is checked by the armored train ""Volga"". ""The crew of the armored train conducts technical reconnaissance and demining of areas of the terrain, as well as restores the destroyed roads. During the movement, if minor damage to the track is detected, the personnel of the special train are able to eliminate the identified destruction on their own and continue to move,"" the head of the special train said. Ahead of the armored train, reconnaissance can be conducted by a drone. If the operator sees a suspicious situation, he reports to the commander. If necessary, the armored train stops and a group of sappers conducts mine clearance. On armored platforms with an armor thickness of 10 to 20 millimeters, in armored cabins there are large-caliber machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, from open platforms ZU-23 anti-aircraft guns protected by sandbags look, which effectively destroy most ground targets, as well as other advanced equipment for firing. An armored train can take with it on the platform BMP-2 or a T-62 tank. The weapons complex allows personnel to act effectively in the most difficult conditions. On the ""Volga"" there is equipment with which you can reproduce a thorough engineering reconnaissance of the tracks. After all, landmines can be located at a great depth under the embankment and intended for a freight train. It should be noted that armored trains were used in the extermination of terrorism in the North Caucasus. Both in the Chechen Republic and to control the railway section in Abkhazia in 2008. But they played a special role in the middle of the last century in Western Ukraine. There they made it possible to safely transfer large units while surrounding and clearing forests from Bandera's gangs.

KomsomolskayaPravda,Russia,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27473.5/4727987/,Edward CHESNOKOV,2023-03-01,Rally in Congo: Africans with Russian flags ask for Putin's help,"In the heart of the Southern continent, the struggle between different centers of power continues","In Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there are again pro-Russian rallies. In Africa's second-largest city, people took to the streets with tricolors and portraits of President Vladimir Putin. In social networks, one of the photos is being discussed: a participant in the procession holds a poster with curses against the French leader Emmanuel Macron. And his neighbor walks with a portrait of Patrice Lumumba, the first leader of the independent DRC, who was friends with the Soviet Union and was killed in 1961 for seeking independence from the western metropolises. So the tone of the rally is clear: Africans do not like the attempts of the United States and Europe to impose their course on the continent – in fact, a new twist of colonialism. No wonder Western politicians often went there: these days the already mentioned Macron intends to come to Kinshasa (he is the one who is met by the demonstrators); Pope Francis visited here for the first time a month ago, and seven months ago, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The latter was marked by particularly vivid statements. ""Any entry of foreign forces into the DRC must be done in a transparent manner and with the consent of the DRC,"" Blinken said in August 2022. Whether the United States obtained the consent of local governments, sending troops to Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan, the Secretary of State did not specify. Meanwhile, in the DRC itself, the situation is extremely complicated, in the wild jungles in the north-east separatist groups like the M23 brigade, which periodically organize terrorist attacks, operate. Why, against this background, Africans are inclined to Russia is understandable. The West cannot provide stability to this mosaic continent. French contingents in nearly eight years in neighboring Mali as part of Operation Barkhane (2014-22) have failed to cope with terrorism. The same is true in the Central African Republic (CAR), where the arrival of our ""tourists"" literally ended the civil war. Finally, Africans remember how the USSR 50-60 years ago unselfishly helped their leaders (like the already mentioned Lumumba) gain independence and build a capable state. So instead of trying to organize a ""liberal revolution in Russia,"" the West got the opposite: already in its former center of influence, Africa, people are taking to the streets demanding freedom."

""The battalion tactical group of the Russian Armed Forces, which included senior sailor Alexei Zavodskoy, was faced with the task of preventing the enemy from breaking through the defense lines and the approach of the nationalist reserves. Alexey, as part of the crew of the combat vehicle of the rocket artillery platoon, carried out a combat mission to fire defeat the nationalists who attempted to break through the defensive positions of the Russian troops. Providing fire support to the Russian units, the gun crew of Senior Sailor Zavodsky conducted uninterrupted and accurate fire at the specified coordinates. The calculation of Alexei Zavodsky, thanks to cohesive, coordinated actions, destroyed the mortar crew of the enemy and up to 20 nationalists. Also during the battle, being under constant enemy fire, the crew of the combat vehicle hit a concrete pillbox, from which the enemy fired at our troops, as a result of which the enemy's firepower and up to 7 militants were destroyed.

Magamedov, despite the difficult radio-electronic situation, organized uninterrupted communication of the unit, which made it possible to quickly coordinate forces in defense. As a result of another enemy artillery salvo, the antenna located on the hardware vehicle providing communications within the division was damaged. Magamedov personally, despite the threat to his own life, moved forward to repair the damage. Acting boldly and decisively, Efendi quickly repaired the malfunctions and reconfigured the communication station, while receiving a shrapnel wound from a mortar shell that exploded nearby. As soon as communication was restored, the artillery crews were given the coordinates of the locations of the nationalists' artillery and mortar positions, which contributed to the destruction of their military equipment and a large number of manpower.

The air raid alert in the Ukrainian capital on March 1 sounded at 12:32 Moscow time, and in the region the alarm was announced at 12:33 Moscow time. Three hours earlier, an air raid alert was announced in the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Poltava, Kharkiv regions and in the Kiev-controlled part of the Zaporizhia region. An attack on military infrastructure facilities was reported. Peter Szijjártó, Hungarian Foreign Minister, at the 52nd session of the UN Human Rights Council intends to declare that the authorities of ukraine have been regularly violating the rights of ethnic Hungarians in the Transcarpathian region over the past years. Szijjártó said: ""Unfortunately, the rights of Hungarians in Transcarpathia have been constantly violated and taken away by the Ukrainian state for many years."" The head of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said that the Kiev authorities are trying to deprive ethnic Hungarians of the right to speak and teach children in their native language. Ukrainian officials promise 1 thousand euros a year to those parents who send their children to Ukrainian language courses. Szijjártó called it ""a blatant step towards the destruction of the Hungarian minority"" and stressed that this is unacceptable and unacceptable for a country that aspires to join the European Union. What Ukrainian officials promised parents of children in the Donbas, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions can be observed daily in military reports. Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg's prime minister, said his country would send 25 soldiers to Romania, on the border with Moldova. And this will be the largest contingent of the Luxembourg army outside the country. In a meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Bettel said: ""The conflict in Ukraine concerns all of us, and solidarity is extremely important."" Well, with such solidarity for NATO's southeastern flank, Brussels can be completely calm. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said Ankara does not support sanctions imposed on states unilaterally without UN support. And it does not succumb to external pressure in this matter. Cavusoglu stressed: ""This applies not only to Russia. Nor do we support sanctions on Iran or any other countries."" These statements were made at a meeting of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with his Turkish counterpart on the sidelines of the meeting of the heads of diplomatic departments of the G20. Somewhere Blinken vomited. Oleksandr Malkevich, a freelance adviser to the head of the Kherson region and a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, said that the Security Service of Ukraine had been putting pressure on citizens sympathetic to Russia since 2014. SBU officers threw grenades and weapons to pro-Russian activists in the Kherson region. After that, criminal cases were initiated. ""Why weapons and not drugs? To create an image of pro-Russian activists as extremists, conspirators and murderers,"" Malkevich said. In his opinion, now the authorities of the part of the Kherson region that is temporarily under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will begin to speculate on these cases, presenting stories that allegedly pro-Russian activists have long been preparing to fight against the Kiev regime. Why it's not at all surprising. Dmytro Shitra, the commander of the National Guard of Ukraine, said that Ukrainian officers are mainly in the rear, throwing soldiers at the front line. He said: ""We don't have enough officers. They're sitting in the rear. Put a sergeant, you're the group leader, everything is forward. I have never seen such bestiality treated like this in my subordinates."" According to him, many of the privates do not want to fight: ""But you write a refusal here, immediately prison from 5 to 10 years. The guys are trying to get around it somehow. We had comrades who wrote and left, we do not know their further fate."" Well, what a fate – their house is a prison. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was concerned about the possibility of delivering radioactive substances to Ukraine through the ports of Odessa and Chernomorsk. Zakharova said: ""It is worrying that such events are taking place in the immediate vicinity of Transnistria, around which the Kiev regime is escalating tensions.

Just a few days ago, the adviser to the head of the President's Office, Misha Podolyak, went broke in an interview with Deutsche Welle that, they say, Kiev cannot allow men to travel abroad, because Ukraine should not cease to exist because someone wanted to cross the border. And the next day he posts photos from Rome in his TG channel. He came to a meeting with Ukrainian businessmen in Italy, and he does not care that ""what is available to Jupiter is inaccessible to the bull."" By the way, judging by Arestovich's speeches about his ""combat"" past and present (at least in terms of mood), he would be indispensable, for example, in the area of Artemovsk (Bakhmut), where he could show by his example how to arrange a platoon stronghold so that no one ever goes anywhere. But for some reason he is not drawn there. Although he is familiar with weapons, and ""served in intelligence"", and during the ""landing"" on Kiev he shot from the window on Bankova and was a military adviser to Zelensky in the critical days of the President of Ukraine. And he meets the criteria for mobilization 100%. And there are hundreds of three more of them in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, if not more (the rest of the women). But no one ever met them in the trenches either. They prefer to pose with machine guns these days where people at the sight of a person with a weapon begin to reflexively baptize. Just lions! Like, for example, the journalist Dmitry Gordon, who has been showing for several years how to tear the throat of the enemy with his bare hands on a silicone mannequin. And as for the rest of the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, you should not get to them with such unpleasant questions and spoil the mood when they stand in line for money at the cash desk. How for what money? 396 deputies of the Verkhovna Rada received in February a 100% increase in salary in January 2023 for ""labor intensity"" and special conditions. It is noteworthy that in parallel, the government of Nezalezhnaya under the leadership of Prime Minister Denys Shmygal and on the initiative of Volodymyr Zelensky cut off combat payments to the VSUshniki. And now since February they began to receive not 100 thousand hryvnias, but 30 thousand. And the allowance of the fighters was also cut. Now vsUshniki are paid only for those days when they go on the offensive or actively defend themselves. Moreover, all this must be assured by the commander of the unit. Who can not only ""draw combat"" and not write them out, but also for such a record get from the fighter ""khabar"" (a percentage of the ""combat""), and, for an additional ""reward"" can write out ""combat"" and those who sit on the ""second line"" or even further, in the rear. So among the commanders of the units and subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine it is now very difficult, almost impossible to find the poor who live only on the official army allowance. But, be that as it may, and while one Ukraine devours the money that fell from the sky for free (or attaches it somewhere), spins combinations on contracts with the army and receives geshefts from kickbacks, the other at the same time rots in the trenches. Where they are then eaten by dogs and rats. And all so that the first Ukraine could continue to receive and spend money for its pleasure. LISTEN AS WELL.

It will bear the name of Bohdan Khmelnytsky - the famous hetman who freed the Little Russians from the oppression of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. ""We will defend our land,"" says Andriy Tishchenko, a former tank commander and now senior in the future unit. An interview with him was recorded by RIA-Novosti journalists. According to the tanker, he made the decision to go over to the side of Russia after he realized that the Kiev government did not need his people. ""The Ukrainian authorities had to protect their people, and they just abandoned them,"" Tishchenko said. ""Looking at all this, I and my comrades who will be with me in this unit have the opportunity to pay tribute to them. So far, the battalion has a little more than 70 people. In the near future, more replenishment is expected. However, not everyone is taken: moral and physical qualities are important, but in addition, everyone is checked for involvement in crimes - whether he participated in the murder of civilians where the positions were located. - At what stage is the formation of the battalion now? The journalist asks Tishchenko. - At the stage of registration of citizenship. Those who wish receive a Russian passport and sign contracts with the Armed Forces,"" Tishchenko said. - After that, we will be sent to the camp for further training. The mood of the guys is combative, everyone is ready. There are no such people who agreed, and then changed their minds. And I think all the guys will go all the way. One of the first ideas to create a unit of prisoners in the spring of last year was expressed by the adviser to the acting head of the DPR Igor Kimakovsky. Then it turned out that many Ukrainian soldiers after a while in captivity radically changed their worldview. It is necessary to remove people from the action of Kiev propaganda, as they begin to see everything that has happened in recent years in a completely different light. ""Planned work was carried out in the colonies where prisoners were held,"" he said in an interview with KP.RU. - This is how the anti-fascist movement matured in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Region, where prisoners of war took special courses during the Great Patriotic War. So it is here. - The prisoners themselves propose their candidacies for the ranks of the new battalion. - In different ways. Someone is offered, someone offers himself. I will say this: every single prisoner is aware that they have the opportunity to join the ranks of this battalion. One immediately agrees, the other thinks. - Is it possible to check if a person goes to the battalion in order to then run back. - This is certainly verifiable. There is a certain system, but I will not disclose it. - Those who went to the battalion receive citizenship under a simplified scheme. - I can't tell you the specific mechanisms. But earlier, foreign citizens could conclude a contract with the same Ministry of Defense. For example, citizens of Tajikistan. As a result of the service, they could obtain Russian citizenship. Here, on the contrary, they first receive a Russian passport, renounce Ukrainian citizenship and sign a contract. In general, Ukrainians now receive citizenship under an accelerated scheme. Perhaps this also applies to them. - And their families remained in the territory controlled by Kiev. - That's the hardest question. In the sense that the biggest problem in the transition of Ukrainian servicemen to our side is that they have families on the other side. People fear, and not unreasonably, that their family members will be subjected to reprisals. And this is a very serious obstacle. On the Russian side, the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine pass in whole dynasties. RIA-Novosti cites the story of the Ukrainian border guard Kirill Spassky, who met his father in captivity. Together they joined the Russian volunteer battalion named after Bogdan Khmelnitsky. ""Yes, my father is here in the colony,"" Spassky said. - He is also a border guard, he served at a nearby outpost. I invited my father to join the battalion. And he immediately said, ""I'll go with my son."" And then, you won't believe it... We met a godfather. And he also decided to serve in the newly created Russian battalion. THEY WILL HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE READY TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE OUR WARRIORS. ""The creation of such a battalion is a very correct decision,"" said Yuri Kot, a political scientist and leader of the Movement of Russian Ukrainians ""Parus"". - The thousand-year history of our country knows a lot of examples when former enemies, Russophobes, became on a par with Russian soldiers. What a long way to go, to take the Chechen people, who 20 years ago could have thought that they would show themselves this way, fighting with us. You can remember such a group, which was called Hawks. This is 1945-46, when former Bandera members sided with the Soviet army and ruthlessly destroyed their former accomplices. The same was true during the First World War, when the inhabitants of the liberated territories joined our army. I think in the future there should be other subdivisions - the name of Prince Vladimir of Kiev, Russian saints and other great people. Another thing is that any sane person has a question about the reliability of these guys on the front line. The special services should select to this unit those who will really fight. And do not shoot your own in the back, waiting for the moment to run to the other side.

The progress of the construction of a large-scale hydraulic structure was inspected today by Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Timur Ivanov as part of a working trip to the troops of the Southern Military District. ""Currently, military builders are building a water intake unit on the Don River, pumping stations for water transfer, strengthening the coastal zone, installing transformer substations and power lines. Timur Ivanov by helicopter overflew the construction areas and visited a number of key facilities of the water pipeline where he checked the progress of the work, the Russian Defense Ministry said. To meet the deadline, more than 3200 specialists and over 1300 units of equipment were involved in the construction. ""Please do not slow down the high pace. We all understand how important the task is to provide the residents of Donbass with water as soon as possible,"" the Deputy Defense Minister said. The launch of the pipeline will fill the Seversky Donets Canal with Don water, from where clean drinking water will go to many settlements of Donbass. Earlier, military builders have already erected and launched a number of water supply facilities, including the Chernovsky water pipeline near Debaltseve, in Volnovakha, Rovenki, Dokuchaevsk, a line from the Khanzhenkovsky reservoir to the Seversky Donets canal. The new hydraulic structure will pass through the territory of the Rostov region and the Donetsk People's Republic to the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal. The capacity of the water pipeline will be up to 300 thousand cubic meters of water per day. The project provides for the laying of two threads of the main pipeline of 200 km each, the construction of pumping stations, power substations and water storage facilities for 10 thousand cubic meters. During the construction, military designers adjusted the decisions taking into account the periodic floods of the Don and the strong swampiness of the floodplain of the river. An additional dam and rubble breakwater were quickly provided as protection against ice. On the route of laying the water pipeline, 63 crossings will be made through road, rail and water obstacles. On one of the most difficult sections, horizontal directional drilling with a length of 1.5 km will be carried out to pass under the railway track and one of the branches of the Don River.

This was stated by the Governor of the region Andrei Vorobyov. ""This happened near the village of Gubastovo, the target was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, it was not damaged.

However, in this particular case, we are talking about a one-way flight and the use of a drone actually as a kamikaze apparatus, ""Denis Fedutinov, a leading expert in the field of unmanned aircraft in Russia, told RIA Novosti. In Tuapse there was an attempt to attack the oil depot. But it failed. The drone was shot down. Just like in Adygea. ""Both drones lost control and deviated from the flight path. One UAV fell in the field, the other drone, deviating from the trajectory, did not harm the attacked civilian infrastructure object, ""the Defense Ministry said in a statement. In Belgorod, debris collapsed in residential areas, causing minor damage. KP asked the experts for comment. How did drones end up on the territory of Russia and, most importantly, how to protect yourself from them? With these questions, ""KP"" turned to experts. Vladimir Evseev, military expert, head of the department of the Institute of CIS countries, on the air of the radio ""Komsomolskaya Pravda"". - How do you think you could have used it to attack us. - These could be upgraded air targets. For their intended purpose, they are used to train flight personnel - they launch a drone, and trained units shoot it down. But they can also carry explosives - up to 75 kg. Initially, Ukraine had only Soviet UAVs of the Strizh type. But they were finalized by Western specialists, and they turned into shock troops. - What is the difficulty of dealing with them. - They can fly at extremely low altitudes. They are not easy to detect. But they can be suppressed with electronic warfare systems. Such systems worked well in the Crimea, called ""Avtobaza"". - How they work. - The drone is controlled by space systems. There is a suppression of the cosmic communication channel. When he loses touch, his control is affected. The device is planted. And, by the way, the range of this kind of converted ""targets"" exceeds the range of the ""Swifts"". - What are the further measures of the struggle. - To increase capabilities in the field of electronic warfare and air defense systems. Not always a drone can be shot down using electronic warfare. Sometimes you need physical defeat - fighter-interceptors. When two pilots are working on a low-flying target at extremely low altitudes. - How many such UAVs can Ukraine have. - We can talk about hundreds of similar ""targets"". They are launched, as a rule, from a catapult. They don't need an airfield. We need to destroy storage sites, those places where these devices are being refined. Such a place was in Kharkov. Anatoly Matviychuk, retired colonel, military expert, editor-in-chief of the ANNA News agency. - What can stop the UAV. - Any aircraft can fly, while it has the property of falling. For this to happen, you need three conditions that work together almost flawlessly. 1. Reconnaissance of this apparatus. 2. Impact on it by long-range air defense systems and the creation of electronic-magnetic accessibility. That is, it simply ceases to be controllable and affects its flight, and eventually falls like a blank. 3. Means of camouflage, which are widely used today: nets, metal corners, which make it difficult for this object to reach the targets of destruction. - Why the cases of the appearance of drones on our territory have become more frequent. - This is the theory of fear, which is used by Americans in all their wars. Before they start fighting, they try to intimidate the population. This is the theory they have put into service with war criminals from Ukraine. That is, this is an attempt to intimidate our people. Propaganda trick: to sow disbelief, to create the prerequisites for discontent. This is a reception of terrorists, war criminals. - What to do. - Experience suggests that such deliveries of UAVs will increase. But we have already accumulated experience in combating them: on the border, where the breakthrough of such devices is supposed, there are air defense systems that are ways to hit them. At the level of civil defense, measures are also being taken to prevent the flight of such devices. READ ALSO.

Commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine came up with a fatal trap for the Ukrainian mobilized. The servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who arrived at the headquarters are given a car and the coordinates of the fortified area, where it is necessary to change the nationalists who demanded rest or evacuation after injuries. Since the mobilized combat area is seen for the first time, and they are guided by the terrain with the help of a GPS navigator or smartphone, they hope only for the accuracy of the coordinates. But when they get to their destination at the coordinates indicated by them in the headquarters, they find themselves straight ..... on the positions of Russian servicemen. There they are asked to simply raise their hands. The stories of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were taken prisoner under such circumstances are becoming more and more. ""They gave the coordinates, indicated an incorrect point on the map. When I got there, it turned out that these were Russian positions. There I was taken prisoner together with my comrade,"" says another captured Ukrainian soldier.

He said that this was initially his plan: to get into the Armed Forces of Ukraine, collect secret data there, and then escape and transfer them to the Russian military. According to McIntyre, in Ukraine he managed to collect papers, files, intelligence and maps. But going over to the side of the Russian military was not so easy. ""When I was in Kharkiv, I wanted to swim across, but I found that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have snipers ... not for protection, but to shoot defectors. I am a communist, an anti-fascist.

McIntyre is now in Moscow. He is ready to testify that fascists serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ""Once they saw a photo of Che Guevara on my Facebook (the social network is banned in Russia). They began to demand an explanation about my communist views. I told them then that I was an anti-fascist and had come to fight the Russian imperialists and Nazis. And they say, 'No, Russians aren't Nazis — we're Nazis,'"" John recalls.
